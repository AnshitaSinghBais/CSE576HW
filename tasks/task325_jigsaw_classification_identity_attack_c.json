Palau gained its independence on October 1, 1994. Some Americans would recognize the ferocious WWII Pacific battle of Peleliu. Peleliu is one of the states of Palau. When you visit Peleliu, you'll see beautiful memorials to the 2k+ U.S. Marines, Navy, and Army service members who were killed. You'll also see beautiful memorials to the 10k+ Japanese who died in the battle. Palau lost 10% of its population to WWII. Yet the Palauans respect the dead from both sides despite the immense tragedy. If they were Americans, they'd already be tearing down the memorials to the dead.",

My favorite part is when he says, \"We wonder how someone's sexual or affectional desires are in any way our business. Yet they are made to be our business.\" His use of \"we\" is so charming.

From my experience this increase ranges from 1.5% to 4%, with increases being higher for older buildings that typically need more maintenance. If you also add on the property tax increases enacted by Council, a landlord's costs can increase between 2.8% and 5.3% (this assumes a property tax increase of 1.3%).\n\nFor condo units built pre-1991, the rent guidelines only allow a rent increase of between 1.5% and 2%. This means that landlords of these units are more than likely not able to recoup a significant portion of the increased costs, which is not fair or equitable. Landlords should be able increase rent by the same increase to maintenance fees and property taxes.",

Since the church still officially teaches that being gay is \"objectively disordered\" and \"intrinsically evil,\" thereby intentionally instilling shame in those so \"afflicted,\" few priests will ever admit to being gay if they still want to collect a paycheck, which the vast majority need to do in order to survive in this cold, cruel world. Even on National Coming Out Day (whenever that is) such a mass exodus from the priestly closet is highly unlikely. Now if the church were ever to change its tune in terms of doctrinal teaching then I suspect such an exodus is more likely, though it would probably begin more as a trickle  than a deluge.",

Let me paraphrase for you. If you pay the Oil Companies 920 barrels of oil for every 1000 that come out of the ground, you are only left with 80 barrels. Even a child recognizes that they got short-changed when they have 80 Fruit Loops in their pile and BIG DADDY has 920. Wake up MAN, WAKE UP!",

But, as in most situations involving conflict, the truth probably lies somewhere between.\n\nHaving said that, it's a fact Baha'i served with Savak, the Shah's secret police death squads.  But then so did many nominal 'Shi'a'.  I recall being embraced and kissed on both sides of my neck by an Iranian at an 'Eid gathering several years ago.  A little later I was informed by his wife, a devout Iraqi Shi'a who had married him while being unaware of his past, that he was a high-ranking Savak officer who had fled the Revolution to avoid answering for his crimes.

The last time it was done in a presidential election was by Al Gore in 2000.\n\nLike your candidate, I recommend you not panic, follow the law, and let the process play out.  The surest way to guarantee massive violence erupts is to let one side feel like the election was stolen.  Don't mistake a strategy for \"getting out the vote\" with belief in massive voter fraud.  I would add republicans aren't fire bombing democratic buildings.",

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true. So I just want to apologize let u know that I understand now.I am sorry that you have to still encountr ignorance",

Every individual must be based on their own competency, experience, merit and wisdom.\n\nMr Damores expresses this very sentiment and stated inequity in hiring is not based on unconscious bias or prejudicial beliefs. But the personal choices women make of their own free will. The real differences between men and women and the diverse groups we all belong to, is not based on personal observation but numerous case study reports and systematic scientific evaluation and investigation. \n\nPersonal experiences are not necessarily reliable ways to base facts or research.

And I get the argument that the niqab and burqa are potent and regressive symbols of the subjugation of women under Islam.

This law simply fans the flames of intolerance in a province that has already had more than its share of vile physical attacks on Muslims. We don't really believe that the tiny handful of Muslim women who wear these garments are at risk of scamming public service, do we? That is simply a lame rationale for fear and prejudice.",

However, any political consultant will tell \"front-runners\" to avoid such events which provide exposure for their opponent and can only hurt them.  It's far safer to be a stealth candidate and, if you attend events, be sure they are sponsored by your supporters, you opponent is not invited, and you'll only see \"softball\" questions.  \n\nBTW: I see no purpose in belittling Mr. Drake, who has the courage to step forward when, it seems no one else in Springfield was willing to do so.  While it seems he's a \"very\" long shot to win the office, he has my respect for running.  I wish him the best.  regards, Gary",

That’s an effective tax rate of .12% of income.  There’s a lot of profit in insurance most years, and Oregon’s current tax rate for these corporations is 6.6% to 7.6% on taxable income, they must have very clever tax departments.  Profits seem to have gone missing!\n. \nIf these insurance companies were real people, they’d be paying way more than .12% on their gross income.  In fact, according to the Legislative Revenue Office, the average Oregon person pays 5.8% of their gross income in income taxes, nearly 3x what insurers will pay.",

When we walked in Albertson's we saw the store was understaffed and every employee was hustling to keep things going.  I found the manager and told him he and his employee's were true heroes. They risked the danger to themselves and their cars, not only for their jobs and families but for those in the community who needed the goods and services Albertson's provided. It would have been easy for those folks to just stay home and the store close. It reminded me of the men and women I served overseas with, Americans performing their duty.",

So while Helton's career home stats of .345/.442/.607 are certainly not a true indicator of his ability, his .287/.386/.470 road split is just as suspect. So for Rockies players, their true stats are somewhere in the middle, and Helton's overall numbers are probably pretty close to what he would have done as a member of any other team.\n\nThe Rockies really should start some sort of campaign educating baseball writers and fans of how Coors Field really works and build some support for guys like Helton and Walker.

Unless a desalination project addresses a baseline water shortage in the longer term as part of a water supply mix, there is bound to be an element of demand-side risk. When desalination is used as a drought response in a region which is not perennially dry, the demand-side risk is especially acute.\"\n\nThis is certainly not the case in the Cape, where both climate and population problems mean there is likely to be a permanent drought situation.",

I want to tell you that the problem not in land or ethnicity, the problem is in religion. Arab Muslims do not want to tolerate people following Judaism as their neighbors. Many Jews are following Judaism in Israel. Now about settlements. Some settlements exist more than 20 years. They are now well developed cities with civic infrastructure, colleges, hospitals, universities and population from 60 to 200 thousand people. Those settlers revived soil on empty lands and planted gardens, vineyards, fields of vegetables, trees, built roads. Also they gave work for Arabs from Palestine on their small enterprises.

Bennie Benson, a Native, designed the state flag. It should also be noted that the Alaska purchase was a small part of Seward's career which is distinguished by his lifelong efforts to eradicate the oppression of blacks (slavery) and his major role in preserving the nation during the Civil War.

There are often students that could excel, but are drawn downward because of disruptive students and incapable students being co-mingled among the student body. Sometimes the families of the potential high achievers cannot afford a private school or don't have the means of home schooling. Should these students suffer because of the current demands placed on the public school system and the teachers in those systems?",

Come to think of it, saying so isn't really that far-fetched from reality as, while bazookas are regulated, grenade launchers and anti-tank weapons are legal. Go figure. My point is, whatever weapons one deems should be legalized or regulated, the line must be drawn somewhere, for if there is no line to cross, what would prevent one from purchasing a military tank. Scratch that, tanks are also legal to own as well.

As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

Why hold one religion to a different set of standards than another?

Sometimes you just got to let things slide by instead of trying to control and judge everything that comes up because you can't fight every injustice that occurs. So why is it ok for Muslims to discriminate and no one bats and eye, it barely makes headlines on B listed news sites but when a Christian does it, it becomes a national event just because someone you don't know was slighted and is it really a big deal that someone said \"Hey, can you do this for us?\" and the dude replied \"No.\"",

Maybe in a couple of centuries, historians and cultural anthropologists will be able to point to Vat II, John XXIII and Francis (among others) as the point when ordinary people responded to the Spirit in both rejecting Roman primitivism and seeking the essence and essentials of the Gospel.

Does watching people lose their jobs and their homes turn you on or something?  You seem so disturbingly excited about the whole thing that you're actually lying through your teeth trying to boost the hysteria.  Calm down.",

Since then, this unholy creation has used the military power of governing systems to torture, slay, and beat humans into submission.  All the while claiming purity of soul and body with caring and compassion.  The dark side of this monolith continues today through brainwashing and physical assault by self-created messengers of a non-existent, invisible being.  Christians and Moslems resort to violence toward any who resist.  This nation's christians continue their assaults on the minds and bodies of Natives and the rest of humanity.

Pew polls suggest that while a small minority believes in the violence (still a whoopingly high number in absolute terms), they do believe cartoonists should be killed if they portray mohammed.  And they also believe in Sharia law.  Overtime you see a muslim leader or Imam get questioned they say \"Islam\" is a religion of peace, but push them on Sharia, women and gays and its all double speak and changing the subject.  Plus, where are they when these things happen?  I rarely see any news stories of large swaths of muslim sincerely renouncing these atrocities nor do I see them doing something about it day to day.

There will not be a second repeal because there will not be a second gold rush or oil rush. Once the tax is in, it will stay in, and just go up.

Even if he cancelled his carbon-tax plans, reduced taxes and ran $30 billion surpluses, it would take more years that he has to turn his credibility around.\n\nCarbon taxes? He's too stupid to realize that Canada's northern latitude makes fossil-fuel heating a necessity for Canadians. Like Marie Antoinette, if Canadians can't afford bread, let them eat cake.",

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

This means that the lay people were the voice of the Church and it was their common sense that determined the horizontal structures of the Church. The head of the Church was Jesus, not the pope, and that made all the difference. What are we doing honoring a human being as the head of the Church, especially when popes are ignoring the commands of Jesus and worshiping an institution instead? It has been many years since I have heard a bishop talk about living the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. All we hear are bishops interfering in the sexual lives of the lay people. Very sad.",

This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

One solution is that staffers and interns need a body to look after their interests outside the control of their employer. Remember in this case the employer and the offender are the same in relation to the staffer/intern. What's really needed is some form of worker representation. Allowing interns and staffers to unionize would reduce many of the risk factors associated with this kind of workplace.

It's also curious that you don't provide any source for your data\n\nYou're also making a completely erroneous extrapolation in your second paragraph. Yes it's crucial to distinguish between ordinary Muslims, including those in Canada and the small percentage of extremists. It's also crucial to distinguish the difference in attitudes and cultures between Canada and other countries. Your post does not seem to be criticizing the extremists. It seems to be using foreign data to vilify Muslims as a whole including the moderate ones in Canada. As such it is a gross generalization and worthy of refute.",

Congress has refused to do this for years, and the Trump administration has used this confusion in some cruel ways!",

Just like visiting Ireland and seeing the read hair, the thin faces, all let me see my genetic family. Of course the issues is that racists arise because they make the differences something they are not...power, otherness, stupidity all play a roll. But we are equally as bad about ethnicity, and gender, as some want to be better than others without the hard work of accomplishment. So a fair amount of selection gave a few whiter skin, blue eyes, some suggest the small nose was good for cool climates, all interesting parts of our diversities. So race exists. It just is amazingly recent and superficial in terms of intellect, strength, values, character, and should be part of our story. But our history of racism is real!",

There is no justification for Trump's failure to stand up and be counted with our other leaders of this country that have come forward to denounce this evil racism for what it is.

This was essentially the dispute between Henry II and Thomas A'Beckett, but after the latter's murder, Henry II backed off on his demands. Henry VIII did cut back the privilege but it did not completely disappear in Britain until 1827. The 1532 moment has already happened. In virtually all democratic countries, the civil law takes no notice of canon law - it has as much relevance as the rules of golf, as one Irish judge put it. The exceptions are where the Vatican has entered into Concordats with sympathetic Catholic countries, the most notable of which is Colombia where bishops are above the civil law. Some countries in their civil laws provide for a form of privilege for religious confessions, but that is because as a matter of policy they have decided to include that in their civil laws.",

So much of this rhetoric about conditions on these boats like, \"... forced to defacate in buckets...\" is just that, rhetoric...and hyperbole.  Furthermore, having worked on over 30 Hawaii longline vessels I would offer from personal experience that never once have I heard a single crew member express a wish to be liberated.  I've heard a lot of grumbling about captains or personal disputes btw other crewmen, but never has anyone even suggested to me that they were there involuntarily. Several of the crew members with whom I maintain a friendship, mostly Phillipino, that I have spoken to regarding this issue of late have expressed fear that they will loose their jobs.

Not only that, but I understand their expressions of bitterness toward many in the hierarchy, though conservative Catholics tend to be put off by it. To those Catholics: Tough.",

SEVERAL HUNDRED. \nWhile this was obviously a nuclear facility, for that many to pour out, meant that it was a production, not R&D facility.  It is obvious that CHina does not have 700 warheads, but many many more. If America, or America and Russia, were to drop our numbers to say 500 warheads, I have no doubt that WWIII would start INSTANTLY, since many of the Chinese leaders (including most of their military) believe that it is POSSIBLE to win a nuclear war.

When the corporation earns investment income, however, this income is taxed at a special high rate (not the regular corporate rate) that is designed to be the same tax rate that an individual would pay on the same investment income. \n\nThe way the law works currently is that a part of this special high tax is refunded when a corporation pays dividends to shareholders. The proposed change is to eliminate the refund, so this income will essentially be taxed twice (once at the high corporate rate and then again as a dividend in the shareholder's hands) which should mimic what would have happened if the shareholder invested it personally.",

He dives for a ball down the 3rd base line and stays on the ground for an extended time when the ball goes down into the corner. If he had gotten up in time and yelled for the ball from Story they would have had an easy out on Castellanos at 3rd on his triple. But Arenado was too busy laying on the ground for show to get up and be in position to make a play.

In traumatic brain injury studies, which inflict excruciating head injuries on mice, most published studies do not list any form of analgesia. When pain medication is given, it is often insufficient. For example, in sepsis experiments, where abdominal surgeries are performed to induce severe infections, mice may be given just one dose of post-surgical analgesia, which is woefully inadequate for the agony of this condition. Pain management protocols often consider the convenience of the experimenters above the animal's discomfort.
