Apart from the privacy concerns  it can be far too verbose. This would also negate the need to start notifications by saying the app name  as you could tell it to say 'New email from...' or '[Name] tweeted...'.

Cons: As many other reviewers have pointed out the privacy concerns of having your messages read aloud is a bit of a problem. I hope that is addressed in future updates. I like that you can have it announce the app name only but in some cases I would like to know the senders name to know if it is worth my time to open. Possible Improvements: Having a feature that would read only \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"x\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" amount of characters of the message could cover the privacy issue until it is possible to identify senders. It would also be nice to see varying permission for each app  for instance %t + %m / %t / %m.

This means I have to manually set the language I want read  which is very annoying. In addition  the language detection percentage found in Read Aloud does not work at all in my heavy testing.
