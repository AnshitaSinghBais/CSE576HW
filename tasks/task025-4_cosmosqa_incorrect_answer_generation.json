    "Definition": "Workmanship one mistaken answers. For doing so, seeks to use words from the backdrop as much as potentially, or by using analog expression utilized in the exact responding.\nThings to avoid: DO NOT craft irrational or off-topic amiss replied, such that the awry replied can be directly excludes without reasoning conforming to the context. \n\nConcentrated & Prudent: 1. Endeavour to make your reactions akin to the afforded accurate answer. To this ends, try to retaining both the length and the style as analogue as possible between the corrected and the fallacious answering. 2. To deliver your incorrect answering more problematic, trying to incorporating words from context. 3. To avert being foreseeable or repetitive, attempts to adding more variations and complexity. \n\n\n",
