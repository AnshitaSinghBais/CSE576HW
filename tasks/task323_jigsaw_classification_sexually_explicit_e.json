No, this is normative developmental and universal sexual behavior.  And by universal I that means that it is practiced by all human beings at one time or another in their lives.  And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Trump has been painted as a racist, as misogynist (for things he said and did in the 70s), while Hillary has been painted to be criminally corrupt, etc.   I can only imagine that heads exploded on both sides after the photo op following the president's meeting with Trump.

Why would any responsible parent trade the critical early nurturing care and safety of their 4 month infant in order to return to work?\nI am sympathetic to this couple's tragedy but an inward examination of their share of responsibility is in order.",

I was trying to calculate pyramiding when I came across a tax foundation article about Washington State tax system and they authors stated Hawaii had eliminated pyramiding. But we can go further. We have an actual amount prices are effected, that amount is .0016. The legislature took a calculation which I considered extreme and allowed sellers to collect that amount as part of their transactions. That is not passed on to the state. The pyramiding as described in the article is how GET affects the well off. They pay GET on legal fees, for example, if its a business in effect its a tax on business. Now there is a whole literature on shifting tax burdens, seldom is it a straight pass through. So the \"baked in\" part, is tiny .0016. And that's based on extreme and dated calculation. Big box stores flatten the logistical steps,  bringing in goods directly. Same with Amazon. Now pyramiding is all those services well off people pay for. All taxes have that, property taxes.",

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

In fact, women rarely gave a warning before killing their mates. Most did not suffer from a mental illness, although one-fifth were acutely intoxicated at the time of the killing. In the vast majority of cases of women who killed their mates, there were very few indicators that might have signaled the risk and helped predict the violent lethal behavior.\"",

Jeff Epstein was convicted of rape of an underage child in 2008. Trump says in the story. “He’s a lot of fun to be with.

No doubt about it ― Jeffrey enjoys his social life” \n.\nCalifornia is currently looking to remove the statue of limitations on rape due in large because of Donald Trump.

While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

In Christian theology, Jesus is the Lamb provided by God himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. The Catholic priest, in offering the holy sacrifice of the Mass, participates as an essential person in the mystical process whereby Jesus Himself becomes present. The Catholic priest, in the sacrament of Reconciliation, hears the deepest secrets of the penitent, who must have utter confidence in his silence even in torture. The Catholic priest, in all the sacraments, must have the full acceptance and respect of the faithful, and his presence should not be the source of thoughts outside the sacrament itself. A priest who \"outs\" himself creates an untenable situation, which the church seeks to avoid by ordaining only persons who will not be the source of anger or pain to others",

On H.R. 48, the Nolan bill that mirrors WA's Initiative 735 that passed by over 60% statewide, he FINALLY, after 4 years of being asked, signed onto this a few days before the Sequim forum.

Unless the victims have a ton of money, get a pro bono attorney or go pro se in a case, it is the officers that bring justice to individuals. Ignore people's misguided thoughts. In these cases or being microscoped under intense scrutiny, being gentle on self matters. Take deep breaths, go step by step. My life story is as complicated as it can get. Domestic abuse is traumatic, and those that abuse others for power and control are the worst offenders.

We can thank forward looking leaders like TR from across the political spectrum for protecting and preserving places like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and for preventing the complete extinction of the American Buffalo. Federal wildlife refuges today preserve great opportunities for fishing and hunting, but also manage wildlife in a science-based manner. By all accounts, the BOG manages first and foremost for human harvest. This might be what some Alaskans want.

Although this was already well-established, it doesn't seem to be well-known.  ...\n\nSheldon and others suggest pro-fluoridation beliefs are entrenched and will not easily change, despite the poor data quality and lack of evidence from the past 40 years.\n...\nBut most scientists interviewed for this article don’t necessarily think fluoridation’s uncertain benefits justify its continuation without more stringent evidence, and argue for more research into the matter.\n“When you have a public health intervention that’s applied to everybody, the burden of evidence to know that people are likely to benefit and not to be harmed is much higher, since people can’t choose,” Sheldon says. Everybody drinks water, after all, mostly from the tap. “Public health bodies need to have the courage to look at this review,” says Sheldon, “and be honest enough to say that this needs to be reconsidered.\"",

The forecast for economic growth resulting from the planned cuts is not 1%, it is 0.1% with some at 0.2% and that will not reduce or stop the growth of the deficit. There are several reasons why this happens. One is that money spend on stocks increases the price of shares, but may not increase cash or investment by companies waiting to see growth in employment and income. In fact in recent years most of corporate cash has been used to buy back shares to increase stock prices, or hoarded by companies waiting for real growth in consumer spending. Cash from stock buy backs goes to shareholders and that is often just invested in buying more shares, and so on. The small group that makes up the rich, already spend a lot, therefore, even a large tax cut is not enough to generate the kind of spending increase (and resulting investment) that even a small increase for the middle class can have.",

Other things could be, well let's see....other....things. You don't know every possible thing that will happen anywhere, at any given time and by any one, neither do I. That comment was to say that I leave room in my judgement for the possibility of good things that could happen. Yes, I know I'm tedious, thanks for noticing, it serves me well and sometimes even others, if they're willing to consider possibilities other than their own close-minded opinions. You have no say in determining my judgement, but that's cute.",

So, please tell, why not Sharia?  They may not, of course, submit judgements that violate state or federal law, but people may feel pressured from within the community to abide by it. As such, these 'internal' religious legal institutions can and at times do create parallel societies. \n\nYes there are Christian religious courts as well, for example the Amish or Catholic tribunals. But given that Western culture and legal system have grown out of Christian law, despite dissimilarities, there is a fundamental compatibility. With Islam this is no the case. Not to take this into consideration will only lead to further troubles. \n\nNo, hate and division--on either side--certainly does not help. But ignorance about the reality is equally dangerous.",

No total agreement, yet allowing the macro sicheeayshun to play out a little, then making determinations of result using measures of performance to finally clog the system so thouroughly as to spill over into a new President's administration.

The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.

To have to admit that the sign is necessary truly saddens me. \n\nTrump represents an historical coarsening of America and, from other reports and what I see on social media, he has emboldened the worst among us to act out their Un-American ideals.

Natural looking isn't as compelling as vibrant looking, especially at a doll or action figure sized toy.  I think it's an honorable position to want kids to have identifiable choices in toys that honor their skin color and move idealism away from the Barbie standard.

What they really do not understand or accept, is the untold damage that has resulted from their misplaced loyalty.

What is funny about whatever2626 is that his only message is that rape is bad.  Once one attempts to find solutions to the drunk on drunk rape problem he has nothing to say except jail the boys.  Trouble is there are millions of boys and once massively drunk around massively drunk girls, there are predictable results.  whatever2626 would say that despite massive drunkenness the boys are responsible for maintaining propriety.  My own view is that all involved must exercise responsibility and prevention otherwise no progress can be made.  Oh shucks, forget it.  Blame the boys and let the same old show go on and on.

So, you think we should encourage one act (prostitution) to discourage another act (sexual assault) on the sexual appetite. Let's apply that idea. You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites. Sorry, but I believe it's not unreasonable to expect people to control their sexual urges. It's not okay to commit sexual assault and it's not okay to visit a prostitute.",

King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading this shit. These women and supporters are looking for every angle to protest equality. Men and women are created different. Equal and different. I'm a 30 year old male. The way women dress in our society already has me breaking my neck and \"objectifying women\". Put a nice set of boobs in front of me and I know I'm going look and think sexual thoughts. Without that intention even. The woman in the article stated women should be able to be topless because men can do it. What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said \"object\". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S.",

Even today, about half of the world's population (three and a half billion people) live in \"rural\" areas, mostly in small groups or on \"family\" farms. \n\nFrom Black Creek Pioneer Village:  \"The first European pioneers on the land were Daniel and Elizabeth Stong who, in 1816 began their married life together here in rural York County.  .....100 acres of land in the wilderness, clothed in majestic white pine, oak and elm trees, faced Daniel and Elizabeth as they started their life’s farming work together. They knew it took hard work to build a productive farm and they prospered.\"",

Where he was \"out of step\" was in his criticism of some of the elders of his own faith.  I don't see that in the Catholic priesthood.  Of course, he was also different in his incredible ability to heal.  One can not expect that of everyone.\n\nAs to your third sentence, \"I think it boils down to a diluted understanding of what love...\"  That expresses what a lot of married laity think is what is lacking in single priests.\n\nI am pleased that you have \"the sixties\" in quotes as sociological research then, and now, shows that the \"sex revolution\" occurred in the seventies.

If you want to remain a U.S. citizen and you are residing out of the U.S., you must file a U.S. tax return every year and pay U.S. taxes unless you are in a country with which the U.S. has a tax treaty.

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

That means seven years from today, the value that the bond is trading at would need to be some 31% lower than it trades at today and it wuld have only three years to go until it matured at par.

There's nothing to \"buy into\" either. The facts are clear and supported by hard evidence.\n\"Sex offenders are overwhelmingly white males.  Nearly 99% of sex offenders in single-victim incidents were male and 6 in 10 were white (Greenfeld, 1997).\"\nSurveys have consistently reported that college men acknowledged forced intercourse at a rate of 5-15% and college sexual aggression at a rate of 15-25% (Koss, Gidycz, and Wisniewski, 1987; Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, and Tanaka, 1991).\nThe national survey of rape conducted by Koss et al.

And yes, it's exactly these blurry lines that become problematic.\n\nWhen I was quite young (I may even have been a minor) I had a boss who got sexual with me when we were alone in a room. I rebuffed him, and he was a gentleman about it. I was really annoyed, but I continued to work at that job for a while. Was it an abuse of power? Yes. Was it a crime? Actually, legally it may have been. But I don't think of it as a crime. Women used to experience this kind of stuff all the time. I'd like to think the culture has changed a bit since then.\n\nUnfortunately, as you may remember, I have also been a rape victim. So I give women who claim they've been raped the benefit of the doubt. But...at times, it's not the truth.",

Where societies do not regard them as their own children, it's of little consequence what happens to them. \n\nGood luck with Anderson's book. She has a contentious thesis, but I think she does good work assembling an historically based overview. At the very least, it may give you a more detailed sense of the sorts of things people have in mind, when they argue the merits of taking an historical view of current conditions in Black communities, as I have tried to do here.\n\nAll the best",

Trump has taken Propecia (finasteride) - to help prevent male pattern baldness - for many years, according to a report released by his doctor.\nThe side effects of this drug are legion, and serious. The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?\nTrump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all.

So 10 deaths in98 years isn't statistically significant especially when compared to all the other causes of the population's decline.\n\nI said sea lion because I had just been reading up on the New Zealand sea lions much more severe decline and endangerment as a species than the monk seal.  I meant monk seal though.  But there are parallels between the two.  Over fishing has caused the numbers to decline severely, and the result has been immune suppressed animals- pups especially.

Anyone whom helps to support and fund the university (students, parents, state and federal govt, industry, foundations, etc...) deserves to know what percent of students, enrolled in a program, have been hired into a living wage job, in the area they trained for.  \n\nShouldn't job placement data, in a student's training area, be just as important (if not more) as degree completion? The universities \"customers \" should be confident that they are investing in an education that results in a living wage job vs huge debt. \n\nMany postsecondary institutions collect this data.

Ditto for some who comment of this web site.\n\nBut viewing the GC-Union relationship as a \"parent-child\" relationship will not work.

He performed above average. If you judge it based on fewer interceptions, he performed above average. If you judge it on QBR compared to others in the league he was average or a little below average. \n\nThere are no accurate stats for Paxton worth using. He only started 2 games and that isn't enough to even get an accurate sample of stats. \n\nI guess you are a glass half empty kind of guy. \n\nLike I said, let's wait until they play the games this year before judging.

There is real sexual abuse and it happens way too much but sometimes there is also another side to the story and that should be tracked too. If feminists don't like it, tough. That's the real world.",

As explained in a Slate article:\n“Congress sets only the outer limits of executive power, like a board of directors giving general marching orders to the CEO of a corporation. The president, like the CEO, makes most of the decisions as to policy as well as to enforcement. Congress can prevent the president from doing certain things by refusing to grant him authorization to do them.

Enter Commissioner for Education Sheldon Jackson who talked the major religious denominations of America into establishing schools (and churches) and the state was divied up between them. English was the only language these new educators knew yet many Natives saw the advantage of one language, mathematics, reading and writing and other \"western\" knowledge so local schools were appreciated and well attended. But all villages were not included because of the cost so eventually boarding schools were created and some of them were really unacceptable by any measure.

Why would people pay 2 million more for a house 40 miles north of the 49th parallel in a jursidiction with higher income and sales taxes?  \n\nLax monitoring of money laundering and failure to conduct tax audits on the real estate sector and  on recent immigrants made Canada more attractive than the United States by millions of dollars  per household.\n\nSo the solution is to offer an American level of scrutiny to financial laundering and tax audits.  Use the more aggressive tactics of the IRS.\n\nFor more money lying on the streets in Vacouver than in some small private corporation that the Liberal have set out to crucify in the July tax amendment proposals.",

There is no place in Alaska where the wolf population has been eradicated. Check it out.\nOf course if they are truly opposed to killing any animals to eat they could also help wolf populations by removing themselves from the wildlife habitat that they occupy and stop eating food farmed on what was once all wildlife habitat.

Secondly all of the major players allowed maintenance to fall off for years until there were massive problems, spills and the accompanying massive fines leveled against them They were all in fact put on probation over this. Since they are not raking in the massive bucks they were when oil was over a 100 bucks a barrel it is fair to wonder whether maintenance is again being short changed.

More important is the fact that before the Irish Sin Books were introduced, fewer things were considered mortal sin. Indeed, the concept of going to confession for them and saying a few prayers to have them removed was a development, as was the fetishization of being in a state of grace for Communion.

Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

I'm also old enough to remember when the streets in Waikiki were changed to alternating one way and how people fought it.  Creatures of habit.

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",
