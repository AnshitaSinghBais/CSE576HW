Did the four United employees need to get to a destination that was short staffed for a flight, or were they just going home? If it was critical that these employees get on the flight, and they asked their customers before getting on the plane, I am pretty sure they would have gotten volunteers.

However, there is far stronger evidence that James Comey's issuing a letter  less than three weeks before the election that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton's emails (without any knowledge of whether there was any new, relevant, evidence) had a decisive effect. Before the letter, the consensus of major opinion polls was that Clinton had a 6-6.5% lead in the popular vote but after the letter, in the lead up to the election, this edge dropped to 2-2.5%. Since the final result showed that Clinton had a 2.1% lead in the popular vote, the polls appear to have been quite accurate and that Comey's intervention swung the election to Trump.",

His treatment was harsher than that of Khadr, his economic damages were higher, and the harm to his family greater. Unlike Arar, Khadr bears some responsibility for his predicament as does his family.\n\nBut quantum is not the key here; nor is it any disingenuous notion of government cutting its losses to protect the taxpayer. Allowing litigation to reach its natural conclusion in this instance is arguably better 'public policy' than imposing a settlement supported by fewer than one in three Canadians. Nor would it constitute 'very bad law' which, as I'm sure you understand, is rarely served better in the bank rooms of cabinet than in an open court of law.",

As outlined in the piece, they used strikingly similar rhetoric. \n\n2) While there were some anti-semitic overtones to his campaign, the real danger has been the demonization of minority groups and immigrants. \n\n3) There has already been a 78% rise in violence against Muslim American's since his candidacy began and there have been 200 recorded hate crimes since the election, the large majority of which are anti-black, anti-immigrant, and anti-muslim.

The only reports provided by the mainstream media focus on alleged under funding in certain areas.  But if examined on the basis of total funding per capita to indigineous communities, aboriginal communities  receive far, far more than is provided to non-aboriginals.  For example, Nunavut (created to be a model of aboriginal self-government) receives per capita annual funding from the federal taxpayers of $42,055  (yes, that's right, a family of four in Nunavut receives annual support of $168,000 from federal taxpayers). That compares to the per-capita funding from the federal government for all Canadians of $1,986.  Federal funding for Nunavut per capita is over 20 times greater than the average for all Canadians.  How meaningful, then, would any claim be that Nunavut is underfunded in one given area of government services?\n\nSource: http://www.fin.gc.ca/fedprov/mtp-eng.asp",

If that dollar for every person who does not want fluoride goes to the few that do I am certain that there will be plenty of fluoride rinse to go around. This is a community of mostly older people who do not want or need fluoride. I believe that topical rinses are very effective at adding fluoride to children's teeth. Why would you claim otherwise? I would think that educating children about the daily practice of good oral hygiene would be more beneficial for lifelong dental health then just drugging the water.",

They are stories that mankind passed down from one generation to the next until someone set them down, they tell truth in an allegorical (not literal) way. The underlying theology in Genesis is remarkable and one can ponder them for years. Sometimes there is a human-like figure who is sometimes equated with Christ (The Son of Man was there from the beginning). The Jews did not allow graven images of God because they knew that he could not be represented as He is far beyond our imagining. God did indeed know that Cain killed Abel, he was looking for an answer from Cain as any parent would do when asking a child about doing something wrong. MichaelAngelo was an artist and he used the old man representation as an artist does to show God. Out of characters!",

Obama has been the most bazaar and destructive president we have EVER had, his race baiting has divided Americans and set us back decades and the madness he has created in America would be carried on by Killary. Having more liberal justices will only contribute the decline of the America many of us grew up in and love.

Cyclists are more likely to approach at a higher speed, and perhaps more quietly than a hiker, giving the bear and the cyclist less reaction time to deal with the other's sudden presence.\n\nThat said, it's a risk we all take when we go out here in Alaska. Even in town in parks like Kincaid or Far North Bicentennial Park (FNBP), we know there are animals out there, and some of those are bear. Taking basic precautions like knowing the trails, listening to other riders about who's seen bear tracks, scat etc where, and carrying bear spray.\n\nI rode FNBP for years with my father, an avid cyclist. He talked with other riders and knew when to avoid certain trails like Rover's Run. I never encountered a bear riding, but we had spray if we needed it. Basic precautions like Sinnott says DO WORK.",

Too many disrespectful idiots banging on their door in the middle of the night, letting their dogs crap on their lawn and not cleaning it up, leaving their garbage in the home owners yard, and getting all pissed and offended when the owners politely ask them to leave....thanks to the douchery of inconsiderate jackasses the homeowners have decided to no longer allow anyone near their house for goonies purposes. So thank you to all of those people. Is it really that hard to not be an asshole? Nostalgia or not it's still a private residence. Respect the homeowners wishes.

For example, nearly anyone can purchase a gun without an owner license or firearm registration. What this means is that even criminals and those with a history of mental illness are allowed to buy as many guns as they want. On top of that, gun dealers in Nevada aren't required to have a license either nor does the state of Nevada regulate any transactions and sales from gun shops who operate in this state. What this means is that virtually anyone can purchase as many guns as they can afford because there are no laws regulating the quantity of guns being sold. While a permit is required for concealed carry, none is required to carry a conspicuous gun, which could include assault weapons which are also legal.",

Much like Trump built on latent racism and fears against immigrants, blacks, and the LGBTQ communities  your charges resonate with people who scapegoat wolves and other predators citing the dangers of wolves. You correctly quoted the only confirmed death of an individual in all of the US and Canada and another suspected death. Both of these incidents  may likely have been prompted because the victim was acting like prey (running with headphones on) and the other victim was in an area where wolves had been habituated by feeding. As difficult as it is to hear these two stories, consider that Canada is home to some 60,000 wolves and the US to another 10K +_.",

It says that he was staying in the Anchorage hostel as a monthly resident when this story makes it clear he was paying $30 a night.\n\nIt says \"agents,\" implying agents of the FBI, gave him his gun back, when that obviously wasn't the case.\n\nTwo of the more scary parts of this is that he was identified as being nuts in Puerto Rico, years ago, and his gun was taken away by police, only to have it given back there, as happened in Anchorage. Also, thanks to the NRA, its is quite difficult for the police to take guns away from psychotic people in many jurisdictions, especially Alaska.

The whole entire system needs an overhaul, starting with the police and ending with the judges who let these criminals back out on the streets to commit more crimes.  I am a victim of a property crime and the \"investigation\" was a joke but even if the police had found the perps, the judges would have just let them get off with a slap on the wrist.

And no, the price of auto insurance did not go down, it went up.  \n\nSo.. \"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\" and \"I'll respect you in the morning\" are both lies.",

I consider Mr. Boyden one this country's finest writers, and I hope that this invasion of his privacy won't affect his ability to continue writing these remarkable stories.\nThis whole cultural appropriation debate is nonsense. Writers must be free to imagine and compose their own stories as they see fit. It's strange that nobody has ever criticized William Shakespeare for culturally appropriating stories about Denmark, Scotland and Italy --particularly Rome--all places he never visited in his lifetime. If they had and he stopped writing his plays as a result, we would not have Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo & Juliet or Julius Caesar today.\nMy advice to Joseph Boyden: Joe, when you are writing your sentences, don't hold punches. You are a very important writer. Keep it up.",

I strongly advised her to wait - and, sure enough, prices came tumbling down when the \"bubble burst\".\n\nSimilarly, in the early years of this century, prices in Florida zoomed upward (more than tripling) for half a decade. Then, they came crashing down after 2006 and many purchasers lost their properties. \n\nIs there a case for trying to rein in speculation that threatens to lead to a severe correction? Of course! But, the \"cause\" might have more to do with artificially low interest rates that result from Bank of Canada policies as well as generous mortgage terms based on inflated market prices. \n\nIMO, the Bank of Canada and OSFI (our financial regulator) may bear more of the blame than foreign speculation.",

As the impact of this hike works its way through the economy it is bound to dampen consumer price inflation, which was already running much below the BoC’s 2% target rate, at 1.4%, in August.

To make matters worst, General Custer took five hundred men and stopped  Lee's effort to out flank Meade.   The south lost because all they had were cotton and slaves.   Lee's family was in a lot of debt to these big banks in the north and Europe and this is why he didn't want to give up slavery.   \n\nThe Prussians were watching this battle at Gettysburg and they did the same thing to the French in the Franco/Prussian war.",

This is a temporary position with the state with no benifits. It took me 3 years to finaly find a position that is a good fit for me,after loosing a few positions and I rely on SSI and Medicaid for not just health insurance and income,but case management services to help me live independently. The idea of Medicaid in a block grant terrifies me. I don't think the poor will always be among us means there shouldn't be a safety net.",

Yet the agency has the time to busy themselves with this ruling based on imaginary risk of monsters lurking everywhere while ignoring overwhelming evidence that children are more likely harmed and abused by family members or people who know them.  How can the child agency put on a straight face?",

Keep water temperature at about 75-78 degrees F with a standard aquarium water-heater of a size appropriate to your tank.  More importantly, cover it with glass or plexi-glass (with a very narrow space for air-exchange), which will trap warmer air at the water surface where the fish comes up to breathe (hold a Betta under water long enough it'll drown).\n\nStrong lights, such as T-5, promote good plant growth, as AK water is full of phosphates.

Earlier computer models predicted that the home run increase could come from a spike of 1.5 mph, so it isn't far off. That, combined with higher launch angles could lead to the increase we're seeing. Smaller seams can cause pitchers to put more pressure on the ball with their fingers, leading to more blisters.

Artemenko and Mr. Sater are pushing President Trump on a 'peace plan' for Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe quid pro quo in the plan is the lifting of sanctions on Russia.\n\nThis is a very big disclosure that has ramifications which will shake the very foundations of our country and totally undermine any shred of trust left in the Trump administration.\n\nPair these revelations with the rest of the Russian connections to this administration and their espionage and treachery and it's not unlikely we're seeing even more grounds for impeachment much beyond the conflict of interest grounds hectoring Trump now.\n\nTillerson may barely contain his glee that Trump has received the secret plans to lift Russia's sanctions, but it's not to last.",

Only 5 other provinces have such a law, none west of Manitoba.\n\nSo no, we don't have equal pay for work of equal value across Canada.\n\nWhat we do have is \"equal pay for equal work\" within one workplace, which means the same work, even though it may have a different job title.

In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you. However, the restriction should be lifted tomorrow, Jan. 14th!\nThanks,\nEmily",

After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past. I'm an example of a successful survivor, but Brianna will never have that chance because someone brutally murdered her. Someone abused her - this time they killed her.

But there is neither connection nor meaningful historical similarity between the Confederacy and the Third Reich. \n\nThe Confederacy was rooted in an 18th century seigneurial society, agricultural in economy and aristocratic in organization.  Such societies from Moscow to Sicily to Jamaica to New Orleans regarded owning, or controlling, human labor for their land as a foundation stone of human society.  But otherwise, the ethical and religious values of the Confederacy were just those of standard low-church Protestantism. Nazism, on the other hand, is rooted in a confluence of racialism, socialism, and militarism. It would not have existed without an urban proletariat, which the Confederacy lacked.  Nazism disdains all aristocracies and regards the party's monopoly on force as the only ethical and legal arbiter.  Where the Confederacy was purely defensive, the Nazi state, like the party, was inherently extremely aggressive.",

In order to fire a missile it had to slow down to sub sonic speed and precariously lower that missile bay. Totally unworkable.\n\nThen a massive cost over run. Originally they were going to use American engines but then decided to built their own (the Iroquois), then the USN navy had a missile system that was going to be used, but they decided they would develop their own.

Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.\"\n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/13/van-jones/van-jones-claim-drug-use-imprisonment-rates-blacks/",

Nobody really disputes this, but student fees are not, and never have been, dedicated solely to academics.

The only way therefore to determine the content of the rights in question is to claim them and then have that claim tested in court. Granted, we could have attempted to specify in the text of the Charter what those rights were, but I suspect that we would still be debating that matter today, more than 30 years later, if we had tried. Better to recognize the rights to begin with, then do the incremental work in the courts; that's a good thing, not a reason for saying that we're in denial.",

The best that Airbnb can do is identify the agent who is paying the tax. The exact address may not even be available. The state should figure out the ownership because they have all the records.\n\nAnd even if the address is given in the ad, the agent may assign the unit after the payment is made. Which unit might depend on a schedule not set up on the website.\n\nProbably the best solution is to just increase the get tax for vacation rentals.

It will be possibly a good thing when the big money is gone and the scalpers pull out. We have no more Uncle Ted  who saw the money drain and got federal money to at least bring some back that the other states benefited from and the oil is going away quickly and all everybody can do is try to find blame.

In 1979 it began to fight the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups with an innovative litigating strategy involving filing civil suits for monetary damages on behalf of the victims of hate group harassment, threats, and violence. Given the decline in such groups over the years, the SPLC has become involved in other civil rights causes, including cases concerned with institutional racial segregation and discrimination, discrimination based on sexual orientation, the mistreatment of illegal immigrants, and the separation of church and state",

Well, the 253 comments before this one have been doing exactly that, so I guess that's her question answered.  But is anybody in this thread going to lose their job because of the views expressed here?  Not if their name is Retrofit, apparently.  So, why are people losing their jobs over this?  Because a smallish group of angry people disagree with their opinion?  Were Niedzvieki, Kay and Ladurantaye guilty of hate speech?  Is that why they lost their jobs?  No?

Cause, you know, he was being a dick.\n\nOutraged by this, Columbus consulted his shipboard almanac to ask if there was anything he could use to trick the natives. As it happens, there was a lunar eclipse coming up. On the 29th feb, the day of the eclipse, he gathered the natives and told them that god was angry for their disrespect and would take away the sun. Disappearing inside his ship during the eclipse, he waited as the good people begged for their women and children. He agreed to 'bring the sun back', and essentially enslaved the people until he was rescued.\n\nWHAT A DICK.\n\nhappy leap year",

The studies have shown negative effects on cell structures, brain function, animals, and plants. Many experts feel this is a looming public health problem as the use of wireless technology swiftly rises in our homes, offices and schools. EMF standards need to be reevalauted and designed for safety based on the biologic effects on living structures not on heat as is now currently being done.\"\nhttp://www.saferemr.com/2015/04/california-medical-association-calls.html",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

His philosophy on smaller, leaner, more localized governance is textbook subsidiarity. And his immigration plan closely tracks Aquinas' views. He has spoken powerfully on protecting life in the womb, condemned the anarchy that has recently filled our streets {see property owners in Ferguson, Baltimore, and Berkley}, and restored confidence in our law enforcement officers whom the previous administration appeared to hold in utter contempt. Is Mr. Trump without flaws, of course not. He is arrogant, not particularly articulate, and is occasionally prone to fibbing ( as opposed to the pathological liar Hillary Clinton}.
