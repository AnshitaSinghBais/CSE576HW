If other Canadians want to attend those Universities, the govt increases the price by a factor 1,000% or more.\n-Quebec has public daycare that is a fraction of the price of Ontario day cares and is publicly subsidized. (I cannot speak to day care prices in other provinces).\n\nThese are two examples where Equalization Payments and the Equalization System subsidize Quebec to ensure its citizens receive a higher level of public service then other Canadians - by using tax payer dollars from other Canadians not just Quebecers.\n\nNot Quebec bashing, they have leveraged the system to their benefit.

It is quite disingenuous to lay the blame for the nuclear option solely on Harry Reid and the Democrats though.  It was the Republicans, and particularly Mitch McConnell who really broke the system by promising, and then carrying out the promise to block ALL Obama nominees, regardless of where they fell on the ideological spectrum.  The blocking of Merrick Garland is an excellent case in point, as I think almost any Republican would agree that he was quite moderate, qualified, and even acceptable to Republicans, and they blocked him simply because they could.

If trump continues to ignore his intell briefing in favor of getting his information from a general who traffics in over the top conspiracy theories the CIA, DIA and  the other 15 intell gathering/analyses agencies will move against him. Really, really stupid of trump to make ignoring our countries intell orgs a point of pride even before he is sworn in. Watch your back trump. Choose your enemies wisely. But he seems incapable of doing just that doesn't he? I sense grave danger.",

Half of all Americans already receive insurance at work which is subsidized by Federal tax benefits received by employers and by employees. The last Republican plan voted on by the Senate plan provided Federal single payer coverage for pre-existing conditions.  If we cut government subsidies, and cut insurance coverage requirements to enable insurance pricing \"at market\" it will mean millions of Americans will go uncovered for many medical conditions which will lead to disease and death. Consider that the market price for insurance for someone with cancer or other diseases could be $50,000 to $100,000 per year.

There was a time Americans valued things like competence, experience, commitment to public service, and a host of other forgotten virtues in order to go chasing after shiny new objects of dubious distinction and questionable superficial value.\n\nBut I do agree with MSW that Democrats need to throw out the old playbook and invent a brand new one to respond to the challenges of politics in this new age of the Twitter presidency. Democrats can no longer pretend that the American electorate is mature, educated, reasonable, responsible, or properly informed - we're none of those things anymore and it's no use pretending otherwise. If Democrats want to win there's only one thing to do: forget propriety- get down in the mud and start slinging. Sad but true.",

The elimination of the ability of the property owner to be able to get any kind of insurance for any use that is contrary to the permitted use of the property use laws.  In other words, the owner of the property that is being used as an illegal rental cannot get any kind of insurance to cover personal liability, fire, property damage, etc.  With no insurance available for the property owner, they will not take the risk that a visitor won't sue them or no recovery if the house burns down.  Being in business, the property owner must weigh the risks and rewards of the income he gets from his ILLEGAL RENTAL.\n\nThis will drive these condo and homeowners back to renting their units to regular residents or selling them.  This will put close to 3,000 homes on the market. Guess what, then there is no \"HOUSING CRISIS\" as everyone cries.  The City building dept. will love it, too!",

Recently, the Board of Game considered a proposal to allow same-day airborne land and shoot of wolves in several interior region units, under a trapping license. The proposal could not pass under current state law, but it represents a troubling thought trend. Were there data supporting overpopulation of predators or a direct relationship between higher predator numbers and lower numbers of ungulates?  No. And yet, the Board seemed intrigued.\n\nIt is time for Alaskans to become more interested in the sorts of practices being considered by our state regulators, if we are so proud of how well we manage.",

Why does the U of A spend over 10 million per year on sports and send sports teams on junkets to Hawaii ?

The college uses an informal ratio of two or three hours for every hour in the classroom for part-timers. The issue though is with full-time faculty, they are well paid for what they do. I've done the math, and the full-timers receive, when compared on an hourly basis, way more than the part-timers, as well as, they have benefits, a pension, and lots of time off. Administration  and full-time faculty costs are very high, and those costs should be examined, with the goal of keeping tuition manageable for our students. Many have to rely on OSAP. So, costs to run the colleges are high, and many students then incur debt to the government to pay for their education. Hmmm...",

And, last I checked, the PC Bible made it clear, whites have to endure all racism accusations and aren't allowed to use that term.

A good example is New Zealand, where immigration in recent years has been twice Canada's rate (1.5% as opposed to 0.7% of population annually). There, housing is even harder to acquire than in Canada, with a similar price bubble and confusion regarding foreign capital. The new left-green-nationalist coalition government has vowed to reduce immigration and to stop foreign purchases of existing housing. For Canada, clearly much more must be done to stabilise the housing market for the long term, without making it harder for people to buy their first property.

Since military power by itself is neither adequate nor welcome by their own people, they opted out for economic colonization backed by military power where and when needed. This is why globalization is there to pave the way for western banks and large companies to take over the world supported by the military here and there. This is also why western large business has so much power, rarely pay any taxes, and are not accountable unless something looks very bad in the public's eye. Even then, it's minimal punishment.

For every Lebron there are 200 of those guys, and for every Jobs or Bezos there are probably 1000 guys who play it safe and just collect a big check until retirement.\n\nAnd what is wrong with both systems is that when Lebron gets a raise to $35m, which is justifiable, the impact will trickle down to the benchwarmer is now somehow magically worth $12m.",

For instance a spill that occurred over the top of a sold, 8 foot thick sheet of ice could easily be cleaned up, while one under the ice would be more problematic. The point is that just blabbing on and on, and on about an inability to clean up spilled oil isn't exactly honest, in fact is a dumbed-down oversimplification of the process that ignores the details that may or may not arise on a case by case basis.

The Bible teaches that G-d loves the sinner (every single human being) regardless of background, association etc, and desires them all to come to the saving knowledge of the Messiah.

Canada's real opportunity in a globally complex world is to pragmatically and open-mindedly embrace Asian and African opportunities, respecting other nations' political traditions and choices, and get the inside lane versus an even more arrogant US on economic relations with high-growth parts of the world.",

Seriously though, no rational person doubts the value of insurance however rational people also know what a racket is and when they are being robbed.

They are totally taking advantage of us at our weakest moments and using our greatest fears against us.

Most methane contribution from livestock comes from anaerobic conditions in  manure slurry pits-  all of which should be attributed to agribusiness practices and not to the livestock themselves. The reason a grass-based diet produces more methane is that the grain-based agribusiness cow bypasses her feed past the rumen,  where the normal cellulose digestion takes place.  Growing that grain however has a huge climate-changing footprint, not only from the fossil fuel to grow it but from plowing which releases masses of carbon.  (This has gotten a huge amount of research interest lately and deserves its own column.)  Cattle on grass, properly managed, are no more a threat to the climate than are moose or any other herbivore.  See www.real-food.com/commentary  for more information.  Thank you.",

But over ime it is.\n\nIn the end, either approach regardless of how you invest in divdend growth stocks is likley to be wildly successful for investors with a reasonable, long-term, investmet timeframe.  \n\nAs always, traders or others who have a short term are likely to disagree.",

If and when we find positive proof as to where the attacks came from and who ordered the attacks, the bigger question should be , what does the international community plan to do about it? What does Canada plan to do, or is everybody waiting once again for the U.S. ? A good rule for the PM to consider  is, when you have really nothing to say that is constructive, say nothing other then what everyone else is saying.",

Our bishops ought to tell us, plainly, whether they accept this directive; and if so how they are implementing it, both for seminarians and for clergy. What are they doing to purge the seminaries and the clergy of homosexuals? Alternatively, they should say plainly that the document is cynical, hypocritical and dishonest and they are ignoring it, or perhaps admit that they have paid lip service to it. If homosexuals are excluded from priesthood, two-thirds of the bishops (probably all of the culture warriors) would be gone; and probably nearly the same proportion of priests -- most of them good, holy, effective priests.",

Remember when Oregon tried \"bidding\" for elite D-1 head basketball coaches after firing Ernie Kent? Setting aside Altman's success at Oregon, he was at Creighton and not considered a \"Tier 1\" head coach. Any head football coach coming to Oregon has to embrace the fact there is virtually zero talent in the state year after year or talent in large enough quantities. So recruiting takes on an entirely different approach than say if you are the head coach at USC or UCLA.

The bounty was not effective. Cornwallis increased the bounty dramatically in March 1751, but this increase brought in only one scalp in the next four months...\n\nFor more than a year, Cornwallis sought out Mi'kmaq leaders willing to negotiate a peace.

And NK has hydrogen bombs.\n\nYou have a fundamental misunderstanding of international law and fascist dictatorships such as NK.\n\nYour appeasement strategy for totalitarian thugs will bring the same result as it did in 1939.",

President Obama wanted to do this too, but some in the Republican Party kept preventing a spirit of working together to happen. It is interesting to me to see that many Republicans are voting for Hillary to become our next President.

Wilkinson and Pickett  came up with a thorough analysis using living conditions based on eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage pregnancies, and child well-being. They found,  among developed countries there was no correlation between wealth and living conditions. For example, Japan, an economic basket case, and Sweden tied for top place as the place to live. The US, the wealthiest developed country, was in last place along with Portugal, as a place to live.\n\nThere was correlation, unexplained, between income inequality(top 20% income divided by bottom 20% income) and living conditions. The lower the inequality, the better the living conditions. \n\nThat needs exploring.",

Although I cannot say I enjoyed reading about the social problems it accurately portrays, the description resonates with the way many of us feel these days, even three months later after the article was published. This is a reality that hurts, disturbs and worries the large majority of  hard-working and diverse population. I still believe there is hope to promote a positive change by keeping informed, reflect upon facts, keep our cool and continue working for the well-being of the United States of America, the home of the brave, to its citizens, residents, visitors and good neighbors! Needless to say Marty concurs with my evaluation and encourages you to keep writing!!!",

When the corporation earns investment income, however, this income is taxed at a special high rate (not the regular corporate rate) that is designed to be the same tax rate that an individual would pay on the same investment income. \n\nThe way the law works currently is that a part of this special high tax is refunded when a corporation pays dividends to shareholders. The proposed change is to eliminate the refund, so this income will essentially be taxed twice (once at the high corporate rate and then again as a dividend in the shareholder's hands) which should mimic what would have happened if the shareholder invested it personally.",

What they've done is augment the function of the accelerator pedal and the programming which controls the car.  \n\nEV's and hybrids have always utilized re-generative braking.   That's why Toyota faced some safety concerns and headlines because people who were not expecting it thought the car was accelerating under braking - when it was simply the switch from re-generative braking to friction based.     This newer system seems to optimize the re-generative braking function which is good for maximizing range and also great for extending brake life (EV's and hybrids have much better brake life because much of the braking is done using re-generative - so magnetic as opposed to friction based).\n\nTruly getting rid of the brake pedal would be like some electric traction motors.   On these, to brake harder you can flip the motor into reverse and press the accelerator.",

If the safeties cheat up they leave one on one coverage on the outside.

In my experience with adolescent Confirmation, rather than being a graduation into deeper investment in the Church, all too often it effectively becomes a graduation from the Church.\n\nYes, the ability to deal with ambiguity is the essence of the spiritually mature. That's a lovely sentiment and quite applicable to adult spirituality. But Confirmation is not about adult spirituality and never has been. We have sacraments of vocation (Matrimony and Holy Orders) and the theology of those sacraments reflects adult commitment. Not so with Confirmation.\n\nOkay, it's a bit of an exaggeration to say I don't care which way the bishops go. I do have my preferences, of course.

I'm not sure I am up to it, but maybe somebody is.\nTake the Eucharist. For 1500+ years it was explained in terms of pre-Christian religious ritual, like sacrifice and altars. The final stage in a sacrifice is the sharing of the victim to enable a distribution of the numinous among the believers.\nThe same ritual can be reinterpreted from a different perspective. Instead of the sacrifice as explanatory key, the meal can be understood as Christ's purpose. Christ died so that we can share in his life. The concluding communal meal is a more effective key today than the rarely experienced ritual sacrifice, in a Church based on communion.\nOne event, understood in two ways, can easily become two different ways of experiencing a common practice. I guess i could have just said Extraordinary and ordinary forms coexist.",

This is what they are doing here, and my high school students are fluent in English by the time they are in high school. The efficacy of a bilingual education is proven!  It results in students who have better critical thinking skills as well as better cultural understanding. I am not worried about our current bilingual students, but I am worried that we need to raise our standards the country over to compete with European and South American schools that regularly graduate bilingual (trilingual, and more...) students every year.

Seems to have always worked to me.\nAs with a sales tax, the removal of the PFD are the 1st and 2nd most regressive ways to the public of raising revenue. The first stop should always be a progressive income tax. The people that benefit most pay their share. Those that can afford it least pay less. I'm not in favor of -0- tax rates (including EIC). Everyone should pay something.\nFor those that demand tax breaks for big oil to continue to do business in Alaska I have one simple conservative thought for you. If the business is so big, pays so well, that is it unprofitable to do business, then it shouldn't be doing business Alaska. There are smaller business that don't need the profit margins demanded by BP or the SB21 reduced risk of doing business legislation.",

If they are struggling now, it's really going to harder for them once the players are in pads. That's where the patience comes in. Just have to wait and see who handles the pressure of being the leader. Who can take the season long beating. Who can gain the coaches confidence and not throw away games in the 4th Qtrs. Takes a long time to be a dependable starter in the NFL. The key for any coach is to go with the guy that isn't a turnover machine, but he has to make the plays that can gain field position and score points.

He is an MBA with direct responsibility for hundreds of employees and $1B in assets and >$100 million in revenue. \n\nIn the private sector, companies with the same revenue have CEO compensation of $650,000. Companies with $10M or less (far less than EWEB) are paid $225,000 (in 2012). So Frank is underpaid, rightfully so, compared to private CEOs.\n\nNon-profits with 10M+ in revenue have a mean executive compensation of $269,000. At $100-200M (EWEB range), the mean compensation is $460,000. \n\nSo you'd really have to argue that everyone is overpaid (it's possible), or as O77 argues, that it would be possible to always attract talent capable of doing the job at a lower salary.

It’s also a debate filled chutzpah: the people who were responsible for delaying the project and driving up costs are now turning around and saying “See we were right: the system is costing more than you told us it would,” and using that as an excuse to kill the project or to sabotage it by only building half or by changing the route.

If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.\n\nI was born without a left hand in 1954.

The Habs' record was better when the scoring was spread out a little more equitably and they scored more: 22 goals in 13 games in February, but 37 in 13 games in March. The fourth line, a combination of Mitchell, Flynn, Martinsen, Ott, McCarron, King, contributed 1 goal per month. That's not one goal each per month, that's one goal for the entire line per month. I believe the 4th line has already got their goal for April so for the 10 minutes a game they will play against the Rangers, expect tight checking nothingness.

And as the largest driver of our national debt, they are largely responsible for the interest on said debt.\nI'm not arguing the legality of welfare programs.  Abortion is morally reprehensible but is legal.  Slavery was no less evil when it was legal than it is today.  Legality does not make anything morally right.  Theft is always wrong; even if it's legal.  Confiscating what someone earns by making such plunder legal is still theft.  Welfare programs hurt the very poor they supposedly are designed to help.  Generational dependency is a terrible thing.  Raising taxes hurts the poor, because businesses will raise prices to pass the cost off to the consumer, including the poor.",

If a bad \"person\" was trying to to load his/her weapon via clip, it would really, really slow them down if it was a modern civilian semi-automatic weapon such as the AR family (M4/M16).  But for the purists out there, an M1 Garand (think WWII and Korea) a clip would be correct but it only holds 8 rounds. Spend some time on your search engine of choice and you'll see what I mean.\nI own two AR type carbines and lots of thirty round magazines. Seldom do I ever fill them to max capacity but when I do, I do. The main reason is I don't want to bother with reloading so often. There are times when I just want to keep up a sustained rate of fire. Mostly this occurs when I am teaching somebody specific shooting techniques and/or circumstances.\nIf you haven't, take a trip over to the Bear's Den and shoot their Thompson sub-machine gun on semi and full automatic.",

Any P3 opportunity has to save $260 million “right up front in order to break even and maybe save even more” per the mayor.\n\nIn addition, he stated that if costs go up for this contract, the contingency will be used up.\n\nThe video is available at http://honolulu.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=3&clip_id=500.

The most successful programs work with locals and it becomes their interest to protect the animals.

It's profoundly stigmatized--including by many members of the medical community who have had little to no education, training, or experience with people with substance use problems. \n\nNo-one believes any more that mental illness is a moral failing, or a choice. But addiction? We're still in the dark ages in terms of our understandings--& are we ever judgemental. Comments on MSM articles often employ language that qualifies under the Criminal Code as hate language. \n\nSo the more people who raise their hands and say \"my family too--& it could have been different\", the better we'll all be.

A good example, is the record setting growth in the stock market with the recovery of the economy from 2010 through today together with the Bush and Obama tax cuts— the deficit grew enormously and economic growth was modest without sustained growth in consumer spending— the enormous engine that drives economic growth—spending lagged. Increasing value of the stock market has not driven investment to sustained job production— look at the cash held by corporations waiting for more spending and job growth that comes from the huge number of middle class consumers that drive consumer spending.",

In most cases, a job was found for them also so they had a means of support.  Yes, many remained because they didn't have the courage to depart from a life that promised a roof over your head, meals, a bed, doctors, hospitals etc.  I know, to repeat what I said before, that many remained because of Family, and because of the loss of status that religious life guaranteed.",
