I see this verdict applying to the U.S. and to much of the world now, Western democratic countries in particular. There is a loss of nerve.

By 1995 the average wage of $31,830 was taxed at 15.1% for families with 2 children.  Not only were tax rates higher, but the average salary should have risen to $60,000 in 1995 using real inflation.  As a result of the baby boomers failing to pay their share of taxes and pension contributions, current workers have to foot the bill or boomers will have to work longer and pay more in which takes jobs from younger workers.",

The Dividend is a highly inefficient and ineffective way to help lower income Alaskans to boot. The IRS skims off at least 10% of the dividend funding right off the bat (at your highest marginal tax rate).

Burke was of little importance outside a small Catholic circle until the US for-profit media needed an adversary of a stature worthy as this pope's nemesis. So, yes, I tend to reject any narrative which relies on this falsehood.

The hierarchy still supports a top-down method of pedagogy, even for adults. (Even the word \"pedagogy\" implies a model of learning suited to children.) If that's the system one is formed in, it doesn't make for robust adult faith but, rather, theological dependency. \n\nAs for Scriptural illiteracy, until the mid-20th century, Catholics were discouraged from individual reading of the Bible. The idea was that the laity weren't equipped to understand Scripture without the help of the clergy, and that our time to be nourished with The Word of God was during the homily at Mass. The Church still holds that homiletics is the primary mode of Scriptural catechesis for adults. The problem is that too little emphasis is placed in seminary formation on good homiletics, and it shows.\n\nJesus played with the children and taught the adults. We do it the other way around.",

And it was somehow competitive?\n\nSo what your brain now needs to answer (and I detest the privatization btw) is how does the sale of Hydro personally effect you?  How does it limit your options?

Sand works as well, which is why they use it on the highways.  Rocks are cheaper, and keep the windshield replacement business busy.  Anyone care to do the math how much the use of rocks costs Alaska vehicle owners in windshield and paint damage?",

I wonder how their employees are treated? I'm sure this controversy is very awkward and embarrassing to them. Some of them may have different beliefs and business ethics. It's not fair or legal to discriminate against them either. We have labor laws for good reasons. Nobody likes a bully. Skin heads enjoy threatening and intimidating people. No sane person or boss should expect anyone to deny their own identity and have to pretend that their something or someone they aren't just to get acceptance from their peers. That's how work place violence happens",

The economy was not doing well when the Liberals took office since Harper had us too dependent on oil and other cyclical resources, had failed to encourage our knowledge economy and had further choked growth by continued spending cuts and austerity. No only did Harper's approach hurt the economy but it also hurt the level of services from government departments that had their budgets cut across the board and, in some cases, were further ordered not to spend all of what they did still get. The latter was particularly nasty in departments like DVA and Aboriginal Affairs that already had crises to address. The government had to spend money.",

In fact, a large safety problem with too low limits is that something like 90% of drivers will travel at the safe rate of speed for any given highway, which is usually higher than the speed limit. Thus those travelling the posted rate are as dangerous to safe travel as the few exceeding the actual safe rate, if they don't stay in the right lane when available so as not to impede traffic. Doubling down on too low limits is a lost cause as you're fighting human nature and the actual design of the roads. \n\nPhysical calming measures work in neighborhoods by impacting the physics.

In the Roman Empire, 9 of the 10 largest cities were in the Middle East and Turkey. Not in Western Europe. This has to do with the fertile soils of the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, etc. Back then agriculture occupied 90 percent of the working population.\n\nThe increases of population in Europe were of the poor and starving. For example, the Irish left after the Potato Famine. It wasn't a sign of their success, but of their poverty and overpopulation.\n\nIn history, the poor have almost always emigrated to richer countries. That was the reason that hundreds of thousands of Brits went to India from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Same reason no Indians went in the other direction.",

The answer would be to do an in depth study of the problem to find out. If the reason is that it is in fact due to discriminatory hiring practices, then the implementation of a quota system is justified.

But even more instructive is the historical narration. As London grew and immigration increased, income disparity accelerated. Government in the 1890s finally began to take a few small steps to improve life for the poor.\n\nBut how do you think the well off and wealthy began to perceive the poor? I'll give you one guess.",

The extraordinary decision to reverse course was in this case taken because the exclusion of LGBTQ intervenors in a matter fundamentally relevant to discrimination against members of the LGBTQ community was vastly contrary to the concepts of judicial impartiality and objectivity.

Let's be clear: the underfunding problem comes about because companies fail to meet their legal obligations to fund the plans which they themselves have agreed to (or, in some cases, generously offered) to their employees. They do this in lean years because it hurts their bottom line; and governments have colluded in this by legally allowing companies to delay payments to these plans, under the cover of providing 'financial flexibility' (and worsened the situation by allowing companies to raid pension plans when they are 'overfunded'.) The result is that poorly-performing companies get deeper and deeper into the pension fund hole, not because these plans are too expensive, but because the companies have availed themselves of the opportunity not to fund them.

They did not support a direct tax on individuals & favoured tariffs which are a consumption tax. A sales tax is a consumption tax. Under a sales tax, every citizen is involved in paying the bills of government, not just those who earn income. The income tax is at the root of all of the redistribute other people’s wealth schemes some politicians like to use. They buy people votes when they promise government programs & benefits that other people would have to pay for rather than the people who vote for them. They use phrases like “the other guy isn’t paying his fair share”. A flat sales tax that everyone pays would result in a more frugal government.",

When a person gets a loan, even from a secondary lender, they will have to provide their SIN. This will connect the loan to their credit history, which banks will pull before lending any money. The more debt a person has the less loan they will be qualified for, so the loan acquired to pay the down payment will affect the amount of home that a bank will finance. For ex, if a person finds a $1 million home and goes to secondary lender for the 20% down payment ($200,000), the bank will not finance the $800,000 due to the increased debt load the person has. The person will need to find a different home that is much less than $1 million, probably between $800,000 and $900,000. This is why financial professionals always recommend that people pay off debt before attempting to buy a home, since they will qualify for a higher mortgage.",

I think certain Church teaching is confused or distorted (especially regarding the issues raised here, and the USCCB is one of the biggest culprits here), but I'm not quite sure why a Catholic investing in the Knights would be motivated to rethink this decision because they support a lobbying firm that doesn't advocate (or that works again) \"equal access to contraception\" and \"LGBTQ justice\" (I don't really know what the latter phrase even means).

There is no means testing. Because there is no means testing there are few administrative costs.  Also, because payments are not affected by employment income, everyone still has a strong incentive to work and better their lot in life.  Keep in mind that universal basic income would replace all forms of welfare including unemployment insurance and old age security. The savings to government would be huge.

The law proscribes them, because by their very nature, they deform the human person.\nWhen one has failed to understand the basic teachings of the Church, as Martin has failed to do, he must be censured.

The housing markets recovered as the worst recession since the Great Depression eased off and slowly ended. Could have been even better recovery if the GOP obstructionists had not gone to such seditious lengths to keep President Obama's policies from bearing fruit.

Both Oman and Iran claim 12-mile territorial water boundaries, the effect of which is to leave no \"international waters\" in the Strait.  The US has not recognized these claims, and asserts the right of its warships to transit the Strait at will without giving notice.  The end result is basically a \"might makes right\" situation.\n\nAlmost all the recent confrontations have occurred in these disputed waters, but the exact location is critical.

Fine, let's take this at face value and say that it's true. Then why is the enthusiasm that is generated for this approach not being applied equally across other risks? For instance, in 2014, a little less than 10,000 people in the United States died in car accidents where a driver was drunk. This is a MUCH more likely way to be injured than by an immigrant, refugee, etc. Why is there not the same logic being applied to this risk of injury?

No matter who the PM might have been, the GoC would have been on the hook for the Khadr payout. \n\nTrudeau did have one option: settle now, or proceed to the inevitable verdict, which would have been in the $20m+ neighbourhood (not including legal costs, which would have added to the $120m~ total that the Harper government spent fighting this).

It was secular newspapers (most notably the Boston Globe) and the secular courts that forced the church to be accountable.

First off, in Canada- unlike most countries- there is no point where abortions are not permitted so there's no point after which gender selective abortions could not occur. And not telling any parent the gender of their child because a small % of Canadians might abort a female is a bit of overkill don't you think? It's also logically inconsistent as you can't support unlimited access to abortions and at the same time oppose people using that unlimited access to have male children. JR has the only logically consistent position- either abortion laws need to be changed or you can just hope for change in these certain cultures- that's it. And the contract idea is ridiculous, how can a woman sign away her right to have an abortion? That contract would never hold up.",

Terrific, your yearly property taxes are low. \n\nBut, you do not work at a local job, and you have not worked ten years anywhere in Canada? Sorry, your property taxes are 20 percent the value of the property per year, for a typical Vancouver house that is 350,000 dollars a year, and that money goes to Victoria and Ottawa as income tax proxy-equivalents. \n\nThat is how you address affordability in Vancouver.

Virtually all previous human thought, and most emphatically all previous theology, assumed the exact opposite--a stable universe and an even more stable arena in which humans, regardless when they live, work out what is true.\n\nUltimately, I believe we must accept that revelation itself is not only ONGOING (in the minimalist sense that the Holy Spirit continues to attempt to influence us, although profoundly hampered by freedom to not listen), but actually EVOLVES (what she says changes over time, adjusting to our capacity to understand).",

Right now it is a wash anyway the tax system wipes out any income from tax on natural resources but the oil and gas royalty income will increase and that will provide more then taxes could ever be provided the state under the current system!\n\n(2.) The state has to make Alaska's oil and gas regulatory process less costly, lengthy, less painful and a lot less confusing by setting up a one stop agency with all power with a elected commissioner/s and since the state owns and sells the oil & gas leases investors and oil companies shall have a right to a judge or jury trial and not the agency that owns the land and is conflicted.",

It's funny because on one hand he is trying to put JOURNALISM on a pedestal in order to shield the mainstream media from any kind of criticism, but at the same time, if he applied that same logic to media organizations who are not inside of his echo chamber, we would have to conclude that Brett is opposed to a free and independent press.  \n\nHe is so deep inside of the echo chamber that he doesn't believe anything exists outside of it.",

To some extent the potential (note potential)  for objectivity by the celibate counselor can be an advantage in pre- and post marriage counseling. Non-professional counselors (most clergy, I contend) tend to bring their biases to discussions. If one is a \"directive\" style one is simply stating the role, relationship and specific denominational obligations of marriage. If one is \"non-directive\" one is ensuring that the parties are informed and that it is effectively mediated between the parties so that they arrive at a mutual conclusion. So the criterion is professionalism not whether one is married or single.

He understood, and taught me, that three concepts can coexist in society: (1) past a certain age we are responsible for our own actions, (2) those who are NOT held accountable for their actions can and do perpetrate egregious injustices against those who can't fight back, (3) the fact that one may feel immune from a specific set of injustices doesn't prevent one from empathizing with its victims, and does obligate one to strive to redress said injustices.\n\nThe author didn't pick the wrong guy.  Ditka specifically denied a century of injustices and atrocities which YOU couldn't tolerate or even survive because he wasn't subjected to 'em.

I'm guessing that this will mean an increase in the deficit since the feds will be making direct payments to the insured through the credits.

The president may have had the ability to order a first strike, Reagan even joked about it but an overwhelming response would guarantee few survivors, thus a fragile peace.\n\nThe new superfuses negates this M A D standoff and enables a hawkish foreign policy to plan on a first strike that can wipe out Russian missiles thus forcing them to launch as soon as a perceived threat is found on a radar screen.

Rather he is describing their awareness of being saved while they were dead in sin (Eph 2:5) and the experience of life as a result.\"\n\nAnd of course, Bill, this is where to totally disagree. When Paul says \"not of ourselves\" he means not of ourselves outside Christ like we are born. Paul never negates the human factor in salvation and always presents what a believer can do in Christ. Paul is writing especially to Jews who think they can be saved without Christ but it also has an application to the Gentiles as well.\n\nThe sinner can \"save himself\" by the way he responds to the gospel under the influence and power of the Holy Spirit.

He added: “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.'\n\nOfficials said Sessions did not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers’ questions and did not remember in detail what he discussed with Kislyak.\n\n'There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,' said Sarah Isgur Flores, Sessions’s spokeswoman.\n\n(continued)",

It's much more accurate to say that monarch populations have declined 43%. Mind you, I'm not saying that that's somehow \"acceptable\", but at this point herbicide-tolerant crops have essentially reached saturation. If there is further habitat loss, it has to be due to some other factor.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out the opposite side of the issue. The adoption of herbicide-tolerant crops has reduced the use of tilling as a weed-control method. That, in turn, reduces erosion which can be extremely harmful to the environment.",

A student (was this also egged on by the teacher, otherwise how does it relate?) tacked up Bush with a tack through the head and made a thumbs down.

In this new system, we've given the first few lines of the post, but often the response is to something further into that prior post.  With this system, we've gotta scroll back up, and reread the original posts to find what they're talking about.

Like civil law, canon law has sets of rules that provide minimum standards of conduct, the breach of which involves punishment. A clear distinction is drawn in both systems between moral obligations and legal ones. They both have means of promulgation, interpretation and enforcement through courts.  They have systems of study and conferring of degrees. There is no need to “ban” canon law where it requires disobedience to civil law, because civil law effectively does that.

Long term planning is good but this is just pie in the sky for the gullible.\n\nAnd now they and their \"partnership\" plans are going to fix it so that we the public, funding all this spending, will end up owning a smaller share of public infra-structure and corporations will end up owning more -  which they will charge us to use. We've been through the same thing in BC where it now costs an extra $100/month to go into the city of Vancouver if you live on the wrong side of the river - and the public is paying penalties to the private contractor because they aren't making enough on tolls.

To address this social crisis we were spared the mindless drivel of today, Oregon developed neighborhoods full of entry level starter homes, the starter homes that lifted 3 straight generations of my Chickasaw family from abject poverty to entry level middle class standards. A starter home is as small as a 200 square foot studio, on up to a 600 square foot 3 bedroom. They were built using as little material as possible, and yet structurally sound to stand 75 years to date. This housing was outlawed in 1986 by high density planning, knowing this would create the emergency poverty crisis, but was justified as collateral damage, and necessary to prevent our government from going bankrupt. You can built an affordable starter home in Oklahoma, and since land is not limited, as is here through urban growth boundaries, land is not 10 times more expensive than true market value.

He cannot scan the field and at least three times now we have seen or heard of players being wide open that he never notices and instead passes to a player who is covered.  The latest example was when he forced a jump ball to D.T that led to an offensive pass interference.

And, understandably, the U.S. memorialized Americans killed at Pearl Harbor & Normandy Beach, not the far higher numbers of enemy-nation civilians killed in Dresden & Hiroshima.\n.\nIMHO, death-toll disparities would not deter Americans from memorializing (and not dissuade historians from writing about) a U.S. city nuked by N.Korea's first, and LAST, nuclear strike.\n.",

I think rather Jesus was a reformer, not a warrior. I will guess the Gospel's money changers symbolize taxation of the poor if the Romans taxed the Temple (why wouldn't they?) and all donations to it had to be in the currency preferred by the Romans. Those making donations were required to bear the cost of money changing?? A simple solution to taxation at a single collection point -- the Temple -- would have been decentralization. Did Jesus think of this solution? Years later, the Jews did in fact disperse because the Temple was destroyed. But there was already a trend towards synagogues?

This was clearly not a transgender woman. The bathroom smelled absolutely vile and I will never go back to that business again. My infant daughter doesn't need to be exposed to that, I didn't need to be exposed to that. Mind you, changing stations for diapers are often in common areas of public restrooms rather than located inside stalls.

Our modern understanding of debt vulnerability is that it is the speed of accumulation that is the biggest problem, and PET's runaway deficits of his last 3 years in power put the economy into ER surrounded by crash carts.\n\nMulroney turned a 2.7% Primary deficit into a 1.8% surplus, and cut PET's 8.1% Deficit into only 4.4% within 5 years - that is hard stuff outside an IMF program, and only slightly behind Irelands adjustment between 2011 and 2013 . \n\nCould he have got that down to 4 - 3.5%?

Last I checked, the enjoyment of elite culture (whatever that is - it used to have something to do with Judaism) was voluntary.\n\nThe views of the Catholic Democratic elites are not a cultural phenomenon.  They come from a legal ethic that prizes individual liberty vs. the power of  mass bigotry driven by those seeking religious power.  That the bigots do not win the day is a good thing.  Sadly, we can't force aid to the poor in the same way we can stop official acts against minorities.\n\nSadly, the Catholic politicians in question have not spoken powerfully on how and why Roe works and is essential.  Then the mass of Catholics may understand it more clearly and we can end this debate - or transform it into a way to give parents the help they need to keep the child.  Acceptance of mainstream constitutional law is not a sin.  Until Chaput realizes this, most of us will simply ignore him.",

Eisenhower didn't sent any troops to fight in Vietman, he sent a team of advisors, not combat troops.\n\nObviously every war has a history behind in, and escalating tensions that led to war.  That's obvious.  We could spend days dissecting the history leading up to each war.  But that's not the point here.

Add into the mix the internet that allows for anonymous attacks on the integrity of others, and a national, powerful figure who operates on such a basis themselves and encourages others to do the same (or worse), and you have a hostile and expanding culture of hate and oppression.

Do you support a \n50% state income tax?\n\n At lower oil prices Alaskans benefit by the low cost of gasoline and heating fuel. That benefit is negated by taking half the dividend.  The state has less revenue funding.\n\n At higher oil prices Alaskans paid steep costs for gasoline and heating fuel. That negative is offset somewhat by a higher dividend payment. The state has more revenue funding.\n\n We agree on Walker's comment being unfounded. I consider it petty and beneath the office of the governor. We also agree on a broken O&G tax system.",

There might be stimulus if he lets deficits grow, which essentially borrows money from the savings sector instead of taking it, although you eventually have to take it and the money paid in interest. Best to keep taking it now. Savings is not a component of GDP. GDP is consumption plus government and private investment plus exports minus imports. Supply side says that savings causes investment.

What if people didn't have to live so close to the edge, that having a couple of kids wasn't such a crushing financial burden?\n\nTwo working parents is a very new development. One used to be able to do it, and it was one parent working a job, not a six-figure position. It went from one working partner, to two, then the savings got consumed, now everyone uses credit. This trajectory, though it has opened doors for the careers of women, is not a success. It's run out the money just about as far as it can go.

We fail, every day. \n\nYou cannot lock it down because someone will come up with more novel ways to sneak it in. Guaranteed. The only way to ever fight a dangerous substance is to fight it on the demand side. As long as rural villagers need alcohol, they will get it. End of story. \n\nSo you can label a community \"dry\" as much as you want and pretend that accomplishes anything. It hasn't, doesn't, and won't accomplish anything.

That subject has been contentious for a very, very long while.

Others have collected all the relevant studies and calculated what the universe of information tells us about retention - meta studies. The quality of studies does vary, and results vary a bit too, but the conclusion is clear: retention almost always impairs achievement, and seldom improves it. Why? The answer seems to be that for our students social effects usually are more damaging than any benefits that might come from repeating a grade. Label a student as a failure, and he'll do everything he can to live up to the label. One good reference: Thomas Holmes & Ken Matthews at http://rer.sagepub.com/content/54/2/225.abstract.",

You can google more information if you want to know how it works.\n\nTherefore, the assertion that the US is a democracy because Trump is now going to be president and HRC is not because he lost the popular vote is neither here nor there and really just comes across as sour grapes.  (And sour grapes is OK, but it doesn't make it true.)\n\nLook, Trump won 84% of the some 3,000 US counties and HRC won 16%, the democrats lost seats in both houses of congress, and democrats have lost over 1,000 seat in state legislatures across the country.

Given the cost of these aircraft, even if it is tens of millions of dollars, it might still be worth it, as opposed to declaring it a total loss and claiming insurance reimbursement.  I don't think Australian military bases would refuse an aircraft in an emergency, but likely have security protocols already in place to ensure that it is not part of a terrorist act, etc.  In the free world, the last ban on civilian aircraft landing in an emergency on an Air Force base was back with Gen.

By the time the project was too far complete the public discovered that the access had been \"value engineered\" out.  KABATA, the Anchorage H2H and Juneau road project are just huge, glaring examples of the duplicity that is baked into the culture.  Further, DOT road maintenance in Anchorage should be limited to Minnesota and New Seward Higway freeways.  Period.

I am away from home at the moment so cannot answer your question as to whether canon law would require disclosure of a priest’s history to another bishop. However, if it does, then any breach would justify disciplinary action against the bishop. The point about Cardinal Barbarin is that by not reporting the abusive priest to the French police, he was not breaching canon law because his failure to report took place before the 2010 direction to obey reporting laws. However, later reports suggested that he had not carried out a preliminary inquiry as required by canon law, and if that is the case, then he could be disciplined. The same principle would apply to the situation you mention. Canon law is a legal system governed by the rule of law. Disciplinary action is dependent on breach of some canonical obligation and creating offences retrospectively is not consistent with the rule of law.",
