So to say that vaccines are making people \"weaker\" is wrong because they are still being infected by the disease. \nSecondly, vaccines have decreased the incidence of many diseases (info on Measles and how the vaccine help fight it in the US https://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/webversions/InfectiousDiseases/activities/activity5_measles-database.html).

Afterward, the Christians gathered also ate dinner together---prepared often by the presbyter---a woman of the household.  It was only after Christianity became accepted and later became THE state religion, that churches were built and the presbyter became priests and all male.  This is the early history of the Church, which the hierarchy won't honestly discuss with people [or admit].  If they did, they could not continue to insist that males only can preside at the Mass. \n\nJesus ordained NOBODY.  Nowhere is it written that Jesus anointed anyone---never mind just men.  No where in the Gospels, does it state that Jesus gave the Twelve the mission to celebrate the Eucharist.  Rather they were to preach the Gospels and baptize all nations.

There is a ton of economic activity of every stripe including the film industry which is on fire and generates tons of revenue and creates lots of jobs. As a result demand for housing will be here and the market will continue to mature. Will it increase 25% every year? Of course not, that was silly, but this correction will be tame and will eventually level off and prices will rise at a normal level. And, besides, most people I know want to live in their homes in the neighbourhood and they are not flippers. They are in for the long haul. They like where they live and they don't want to move.

The choices here appear to have been the more extreme option to balance the budget (presumably at the expense of existing programs and/or tax increases) or to allow the debt to grow providing that it does not increase the ratio between debt and GDP. \nClearly those are not the only choices and the vast majority would have chosen something in the middle - a result that the pollster did not want.",

Moreover, TLC’s accumulated deficit topped $1.1-billion by the end of 1998.\n\n- There were other miscues for O’Leary, too. In 2004, he was appointed to the board of Environmental Management Solutions Inc. (later called EnGlobe Inc.), an Ontario waste management firm. Soon afterwards, the board fired the company’s CEO. But the company’s leadership was unable to arrest a decline in its fortunes brought on by an overambitious acquisition program; the stock price slid from close to $4 to 3.5 cents during O’Leary’s term of almost five years as a director.\n\nThis is just a sample, if O'Leary can't run his own business empire, how can he run a country?",

Lynch has a chance to make the Broncos explosive and very dangerous...but he needs a lot more reps. Remember, he is just a second year guy with very little experience. So how does he get experience? He has to be given a chance to play and make mistakes and move on from them. Denver is in a tough position, they have a championship defense but a QB problem...at least for now.

I would welcome an income tax, as long as its a flat tax and everyone, the rich to the poor ante up with no exceptions, no shelters and no write offs.

Maybe the jokers like him will be more careful in spending and less likely to rise the taxes if they know that it is hurting the poor. That is good leverage in keeping the taxes low or else, he would tax and spend without limits like any other Democrat.

Freight rates are so low (shipowners losing money) that many shipowners are either in bankruptcy, already have collapsed and left the market, or are about to go out of business. That means they have left markets and abandoned their customers. Look up Hanjin shipping for an idea of what happened to those people who had cargo stuck onboard their ships that were seized in ports.

That makes me wonder what else is going on in the Pacific.  \n\nOh yeah, and when local stocks drop, wholesalers will be forced to bring in that crap from overseas.  With little to no health regulations!  Perfect example is lovely Whole Foods who dropped Hawaii after \"slavery allegations\" and didn't bother to do their own homework.  Instead they bring in brown, old ahi and swordfish!  \n\nAnd let's have the longliners travel further and spend more fuel, creating a larger carbon footprint.  That makes no sense if you're a true enviro.  \n\nFish migrate and there's no solid data out there to convince me that MPA's actually work.",

The prayers are said with great respect, not intoned, and the parts meant to be chanted are chanted, not recited. Each gesture has a meaning, and no gestures are added. The result, in my opinion, is a Liturgy that speaks for itself: both simple and powerful, and one that doesn't require innovation.

It's easy to find this in the written record at the time. In the 1867 election his party only got 34% of the vote, and much of it was despite him, because of George-Étienne Cartier and others. What is novel now is that those opinions are no longer being dismissed. He was not a widely respected man in his own time, but his image was brushed up by the Orange Lodge, his allies, and Tories who had few successes, and later by a need to emulate the worship of founders in other countries.  He was an embarrassment to the country, then as now, and it is claiming otherwise that is revisionism.",

The idea was that the laity weren't equipped to understand Scripture without the help of the clergy, and that our time to be nourished with The Word of God was during the homily at Mass. The Church still holds that homiletics is the primary mode of Scriptural catechesis for adults.

Gone are the days of 'boat races' and other drinking contests. Most alcohol consumed is off campus, where universities have little or no control.\n\n3. With most students entering university after Grade 12, this means they are usually underage for their first year, and some for part of their second.  How these students gain access to alcohol is again beyond the university's control.\n\nIt is a social issue more than anything else.

But what has happened and continues in the housing market will not be corrected with tiny incremental changes that punish first time buyers and reward individuals who cannot even demonstrate where that money came from to buy property in Canada.",

Absent the crown's authority, those separate colonies considered themselves independent states. They were persuaded to join a union of such independent states- the United States of America- by allowing them to retain a great deal of control over their own government, laws and social order. That included the existence of slavery.\n\nGetting rid of slavery had to happen, but you can see how doing so would draw huge resistance in those former colonies where it was deeply ingrained in the economy and culture. T slave states had a justifiable political grievance- the principle under which the union was first formed was being usurped. Their way of life was about to be overthrown, and obviously that wasn't the reason they signed on to the Constitution.",

Richard John Neuhaus, freely admitted, was to forge a strong bond between conservative Protestants, conservative Catholics, and the Republican party. Of course, since that endeavor served the agenda of two sitting popes for more than two decades, nothing was ever said about it, except to offer tacit support. Now we have a new pope who sees things differently, thank God. So yes, finally, something is being said in response to Neuhaus' ill-conceived enterprise. Better late than never.",

Handguns are heavily favored. However, if defending a home, a rifle, including AR-15s can be made readily accessible and is highly effective. As to accuracy, a rifle, AR-15 included, is far more accurate due to the significantly longer sight radius; the distance between the front a rear sights. Semiautomatic rifles, such as the AR-15 are capable of firing many bullets in a short time, just as are semiautomatic handguns, caliber 9mm parabellum specifically, that commonly are equipped with magazines that will hold 15 to 17 cartridges. There are some extended handgun magazines that will accommodate even more. The AR-15 is a very popular rifle used in various ways and rarely in mass murders.

SJ beat them to the puck and beat them off the puck for 2/3 of the game. SJ knows what it takes to get to the final. The Oilers don't, and right now it shows.\n\nTo be fair, the officiating was a bit selective.  A tiny, vague hip hook on a routine zone clearance by SJ produces an Oilers penalty, but Maroon gets utterly taken out of a 2 on 1 play by a winger who jammed his stick up under both of Maroon's arms and literally heaved him out of contention for the puck, and the winger goes unpunished.

Our bishops in the past sent them to institutions for \"healing,\" not realizing that you cannot cure clerical or non clerical recidivism. I think most bishops have learned their lesson.

So the discussion becomes more nuanced. \n\nYou refer to radiative forcing of CO2. Yet Myhre et al (1998) suggest a doubling of CO2 from 300 – 600 ppm would result in a further ~1.5C increase in surface temperatures. A 100 ppm build would not yield the approx 1.0 deg C increase we've seen in 100 year. Perhaps a 1/3  of the rise can be accounted for that way. \n\nindustrial/aviation/fire/volcanic atmospheric particulates accounts for some of the rise by decreasing the albedo of northern hemisphere glaciers.

One will often hear, \"We must learn from such and such a person. \n\nThe prime minister did not cause the Chinese to lose face as did Trump.  The Chinese like the prime minister.  They certainly don't trust Trump.  The Chinese are very, very practical.  Justin Trudeau will do well with Trump now that the paradigm has changed.

In 2016, the transport of sockeye smolts killed 88%. We are headed for another \"lonesome Larry\" situation.  \n3. Survival at EACH dam of 97% is irrelevant. It does not measure mortality through the reservoirs. The 4 dams & reservoirs are responsible for killing 30% of the downstream migrating smolts. The 4 dams on the Columbia kill another 20%.\n4. The 2015 power production of the 4 dams was enough for 600,000 homes, not 1.87 million.  In 2015, 40% of the power produced by BPA was exported to CA.  So no need to replace it.

The rites for the liturgy and sacraments were changed to emphasize their connection to Christ as revealed in Scripture and through our traditions.\nRetreating back into our castles and condemning other people had proved disastrous for Pius IX and his successors. Europe was in flames and then in ruins. The exodus from the Church started then, with liberalism, communism, and other movements pulling people away from their home in the Church.

Morphine at the time was a popular recreational drug, and Bayer wished to find a similar but non-addictive substitute to market. However, contrary to Bayer's advertising as a \"non-addictive morphine substitute,\" heroin would soon have one of the highest rates of addiction among its users.\" From Wikipedia but it is the same as my own research on the subject.

There certainly is much evidence that women deacons existed in the early centuries of both the Eastern and Western Churches.  But there is considerable disagreement about if they were ordained or appointed, and if ordained, just what their functions as ministers were (as opposed to male deacons).  In the Western Church, Women deacons, too, preached the Gospel but only to other women, and went into places where men were not allowed.  The exact history of female deacons - particularly in Roman Catholicism - in muddied with twists and turns, regional and cultural differences, thus the varied interpretations.  By the twelfth century, women deacons disappeared in both Eastern and Western churches, it seems that menstruation was the reason for forbidding women being ordained to any clerical rank.

The other problem is that there is little incentive for consumers to cut costs if they aren't the ones paying - indeed, the pressure on them is to get the most expensive care possible in order to get the most mileage out of their deductibles, and because of the perception that expensive = better.

The current budget has $24.3 billion allocated for debt service charges and the previous two budgets had $25.7 billion allocated to debt service charges (interest).

All these folks have to go on as far as minority experiences are the regurgitations of people like Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and tv shows like Cops. They don't actually interact with any non-whites on a day-to-day basis. Everything they are reading/watching is reinforcing the fearful/prejudice stereotypes they already possess. It's the same reason we are having so many unarmed black people shot during \"routine\" police stops. The white police officers have no history of minority interaction and are thrown into minority districts on patrol. With no experience to draw on this leads to fear which leads to quick trigger fingers. The article is correct in it's one main point - Trump expertly tapped into this \"white fear\" and executed a clear path to the Presidency due largely to stoking those fears.",

SNAP is doing for victims, what we Catholics would have assumed that the Church leaders would be doing, that is, protecting the innocence of children and vulnerable adults from sexual abuse and rape. It is shocking for me to have to admit that the pope and bishops are still ignoring the command of Jesus to protect the innocence of children. All I can conclude is that Gretchen does not realize the shame and shock that victims have experienced from clergy that have no conscience about their own crimes against children and vulnerable adults.

When that happened, any other country that had the chance of oil production, drilled, then went into production. Now, there are lots of producers and they are like Alaska: they can't afford to stop pumping oil because that is how they run their economies (read: feed their people). They have lost the ability to control production.\n\nOne would think that the people of Alaska would rejoice in low oil prices. We use the stuff to heat our homes and power our internal combustion devices. To many of us, low fuel prices mean we can better feed our families.\n\nJay, keep talking, please!

Given the volume of conservative bishops who share Cupich's predecessor's vision, I'd say his noble effort is akin to using a teaspoon to dig a well.

I think you have to go to the Back to Back teams to look at what teams love to achieve. A killer offensive line that was led by Elway and Davis. They could score fast and many games they pulled Davis and coasted. After Elway retired Shanahan kept trying the same formula but didn't have the QB that could scare you like Elway. Manning could score fast but never took time off the clock and got bit sometimes. So many teams jump out to a big lead but take their foot off the gas and they end up in a game they can lose in the 4th Qtr. We've all seen it. No team is really out of it in the shootout games. I just like a team that runs and kills the clock and keeps the defense rested and win games like 21-10. I think those days are over. Only a few of those type coaches left.",

I look out my window and I see a country that is not destroyed; one that has problems, but nothing as bad as they could be. Obama has improved our healthcare situation (and I say that as a business owner enjoying both better benefits AND lower premiums). He hasn't ended racism, solved global climate change, or closed Guantanamo, but overall his terms in office have been positive.\n\nHowever, you are right. Trump's candidacy will spell the end of the Republican party. Sadly, I must say \"good riddance\".",

I'd rather have 20 rooms air conditioned for 10 years then to have 10 rooms air condition by solar power for 10 years. \n\nThe cost could be the same in other words the investment would break even at that time. And at that time you'd be replacing the whole system's anyway. We need to run the surveys and do the analysis before deciding.\n\nHECO could do the survey and analysis and then sub installers.",

Instead of truly trying to help his students, he refused and was fired.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to.

Even when he was arguing for voluntary colonization during his first two years as president, Lincoln did not envision forced deportations of ex-slaves. Moreover, historians agree that the idea of large-scale, voluntary colonization was effectively dead by the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued on Jan. 1, 1863 -- more than two years before Lincoln’s assassination.

Leaving to one side many obvious and vital questions, this ploy is tactically flawed. \n\nFirst, it has been suggested that Trump is projecting this wild man, erratic loose cannon image to confuse and unsettle others as a prelude to the commencement of negotiation of trade and defence issues with them. However, isn't he only thereby opening many of these very issues well before the new US Administration is itself organized and ready for such negotiations?  Will the US actually be putting itself at a serious disadvantage because it will lose control of the sequence and pace of negotiations on each issue and with each nation it wishes to target?

Sex IS a \"biological imperative\" - you have the plumbing you were born with (intersex being a rare exception).

I mean Trevor Williams and Casey Hayward are great but Thomas would have broke something out. Plus not going after the Chargers weakness the run defense and tackling was a huge issue. Some screens, delays, runs up the middle just pound it right down, because Ingram, Bosa and McCain were in Simien's face all game long.

The conclusion is that w.r.t hurricanes, the important \"tell\" re global warming is not precipitation, nor frequency, but storm surge, enhanced by warming oceans and sea level rise, rendering loss from such events as continually rising with time. Ivo, by selecting meteorologists known as climate change deniers, you have cherry picked your data to support your conclusion i.e. that hurricanes are no more damaging than they were 100 years ago.

Now I don't agree with much of what Ted Cruz advocates but I do believe he deserved more respect from Mr. Trump.   Ted Cruz is a man with a moral compass.

But this renting/avoiding debt will give them far better portability in a climate where job security is diminished and wages are low. And, if they have essential skills that a region needs, this portability - plus a willingness to actually BE portable - will give them a lot of leverage to ransom their essential talents. In places where house costs are (increasingly) astronomical, you will see more and more user fees, tolls, etc. to offset the incentives needed to attract and retain critical health care staff, etc. - and you will see services suffer. \n\nIt's very instructive to look at migration trends for people under 45 in places like Vancouver right now.",

May I take this as a definition of \"capitalism\"?

So, given your definition of \"capitalism\", can you point to any single nation, country, region, or whatever that could be called \"actually existing capitalism\"?   Also, are we justified in thinking that people will die because of \"capitalism\" slower or at least no faster in the future than they have in the past? If so, why?

With her expertise in the climate and plant culture in this area of the state, it makes no sense to force her  to move to Fairbanks.  She has been a tremendous resource for the gardeners of Anchorage, and we want to keep her.",

Yes, parents had a difficult time getting on the base and participating in their children's education.   Here is my question:   Since a majority of the (current) ASD schools are grouped in the area near the Government Hill Gate, why can't the land be deeded over to the Municipality?   Clearly, that is what happened with Government Hill School.    The official fence and \"gate\" can be moved beyond the ASD buildings, and access would be easier for civilians and school personnel.   Military parents would have no problem going in and out.  The federal government has already combined and downsized JBER and might be amenable.   Students can always be transitioned into their neighborhood schools on a trial basis, & still have a school to which they can return, if needed.",

Liberals wanted to use immigrants as a way to get them to be Canadians. So, therefore, both parties are guilty of this, and the Conservatives wanted to use the plight of the Yazidis when desertification due to the wars has been descending southward and famines have been occurring in Yemen and across SW Asia. Also, immigration should be targeted because it makes sense, and this beats anti-immigration anytime because it distracts and other factors contribute as to why we don't have full employment.",

And as for non-white voters, Trump got more votes from non-whites because they are a larger share of the electorate than they were in 2008 or 2012. So, if racism isn't a factor, shouldn't Trump be doing MUCH better? Shouldn't he have parity with Clinton or another Democrat?

If the bill moved out of conference, we, the public, would still need to vote on it to amend the constitution. \n\nAs far as taxes go – this bill would have not affected the vast majority of Hawaii residents who do not own several rental properties. It would have, however, asked rich inventors to contribute their fair share to fund our public schools. \n\nThe fact is thousands of students go years without a teacher because our schools cannot attract them.

On the bright side, it gets her off the City Council where she has been a disaster. However, the community is now prepared to vote her off the city council even if she runs again. (She's lost the Whiteaker neighborhood's trust and has some black marks in River Road as well, so she is vulnerable if someone runs.)\n\nI'm really hoping someone of quality steps up and runs for this seat so we don't just have a Democratic party insider like Stahl. Perhaps the owner of Blairally, who happens to be the well-loved chair of the Whiteaker Community Council, will jump in. I figure a man who can make a living for his family running an arcade must be some sort of business genius, and it is apparent that we need some better brains on the County Commission.",

Our diocese has literally over 100 certified lay ministers who not only completed the three year formation, but for the most part paid for it themselves.  The program itself was excellent with instructors drawn from  religious, and laypeople from local colleges.  Upon graduation  the participants were inspired and galvanized to start making  a difference in their parishes, only to discover their pastors had no idea what to do with them, even though the vast majority would be working for no salary.  Apparently there was no preparation given to priests on how to benefit from this boon of free, qualified personnel.  As a result the program faltered leaving many eager, well educated  people with  little to do.",
