Thus, the seat was showing vacant and was assigned to a standby passenger by United.  Yamaguchi is a teacher and is supposed to be smart.  If her son was checked in for the flight with the ticket she purchased, all she had to do was produce the boarding passes to show the two seats assigned to her and her son and that would have ended the confrontation.

The sad part:  Unions support employees in being stagnant, which fits into the public perception.  Some employees who want to perform based upon standards of professionalism are often bullied into inertia, take other jobs or leave government.\n\nThe only time our state GOVERNMENT will take action is when costs of operation are no longer affordable; e.g., MAUI HOSPITALS.  \n\nThis law if signed will make it even harder for GOVERNMENT  officials (Governor, Directors, Division and Branch Chiefs, Supervisors) to execute needed changes, big or small.",

How much would it cut illegal immigration? etc.\nWhat are the costs of deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants?

It goes right into the fishing grounds these people claim to want to keep clean.    They said if the trans-Alaska pipeline was built it would destroy Alaska . It didn't . They said if a road was built to Whittier it would cover the entire Bear Valley and destroy Whittier . It didn't.   They say Pebble will destroy all the salmon , and even claim the salmon on on their side.  Like salmon want to get killed by fishermen . There is zero doubt that with all the safeguards and permitting Pebble can and will be built safely.",

It does not mean that the complainant is guilty when police decide a case is 'unfounded'.\n\nThe incidents of false accusations are seen to be rare and that makes sense when one considers all the reasons the current system fails the victims of sexual assault and further punishes those who get up the courage to stand up for themselves against the assault perpetrated against them.  It is very hard to prove these cases which means it is far more prevalent that victims never see justice.

The U.S., for no reason other than incompatible ideology, invaded Korea in 1951 and killed 3 millions in North Korea. NK did not drop a single bomb on the U.S. for the same reason. For this Holocaust, NK like Vietnam & Cambodia will be enemy of America for a very long time. \n2. Given their enemy status NK development of big missiles, nuke ICBM even, is a very sound strategy. The sole purpose is to discourage another U.S. invasion, and if that happen retaliation. NK adopted this strategy from China, which has worked most effectively. When U.S. threatened nuke and invasion of China during the Vietnam War, China did a crash program for nuke and ICBM. U.S. dared not touch China since. \n3.

The merging onto it would further reduce capacity. The result would be a huge waste of money and there is a good chance it would not even work. A much better idea is to complete the rail then, when they finally become practical (which could be several decades), use shared automated vehicles (cars, vans, buses) to get people to and from the rail.",

He was playing everyone and take a look at his eyes and you know he wasn't being \"totally\" honest.

He may not be what you consider to be our president, but when will all of you wake up?  He is our POTUS.  Impeachment, you all make me laugh!  Who are the idiots here?  If he does get impeached, it will by his choice, and you know what, I wouldn't blame him for DIGGING OUT!!!!

I just don't see it, especially once a few months of Trump tweets and actual Trump management in power have gone by (remember Trump hasn't had to actually manage or lead anything yet where he is responsible to others).  Running a business vs a govt are miles apart.  \nSecond, not speaking French is a big issue, it shouldn't be, but it is.  PQ will love that.  More Quebec battles?\nThird, not sure how O'Leary - Kenney comparison makes any sense.  Kenney is a real social conservative, not O'Leary.  Kenney is seeking power where there is a traditional conservative base, O'Leary less so.  Kenney has no business skills, but an excellent ground game of young bootstrappers for ground game support.  O'Leary is a business person with no political ground game, yet.",

Buster is free to reject the notion of \"repressed memory syndrome\" if he likes, but that does not make him right. Far more important than repressed memory is the suppression of unpleasant memories that we all engage in all the time.\n\nI concur with your repudiation of those who have \"little or no empathy\" for victims with two caveats--the overwhelming majority here are consumed with empathy for victims, and that empathy extends to Buster, a fellow victim.",

Electric motors usually generate much more torque at 0 speed than an ICE which requires high rpms to produce sufficient power to overcome its own piston compression requirements (remember each piston is only producing power about 25% of the time, and that power stroke needs to power the remaining compression, injection and exhaust strokes) ergo an ICE engine tends to hit its peak torque towards its mid level revs and then needs a gearbox to convert those ~3000rpms into  1 rpm at the wheel. (Diesels tend to have a torque curve that continues to rise with rpms)  Whereas an electric motor generates instant torque at starting thus no need to reduce rpms to wheels, and the rotating magnetic field eventually brakes the amount of current into the stator magnets thus reducing the torque once the rotor is turning. But ultimately the stall torque load of most electric motors is still higher than peak torque in an ICE.",

Those people don't have political aims and don't care how the general public reacts. A mental case killing their spouse and children is not terrorism.

Of course there were anti-Semites and collaborators in Poland, and the pre-war Sanacja regime should have been far more robust in their attitude to the extremists, but the inaction of other European countries, which allowed the Third Reich to re-arm while doing nothing, is what fundamentally allowed the subsequent horrors to happen. \n\nHaving made the above point, I agree with the rest of your observations and I feel that the sooner the xenophobic Kaczynski steps down, the better.",

Since slaves could not vote, by using an electoral college, the south was able to count them as part of their population base (albeit at a rate of 2/3 of a person) and increase their number of electoral college votes.

What it really was, was genocide, the kind only 'Great' Britain could do best.\n\nMany of those emigres came to Canada - hungry, exhausted, sick, penniless, in great need. In Canada, especially in Hamilton and other areas of South West Ontario, those immigrants (who did NOT have an application pending) were sheltered, fed, healed and merged into our society. Today they make up an important back bone of the Canadian mosaic. If you have any doubts about the loyalty or gratitude they felt then all you have to do is research the history of the Irish and Scots guards in the first and second world wars. \nThose immigrants did not fare as well in the US.

You are denying your own church communities the sacraments by looking past this gift in front of you.  You may need to ammend the Catholic catechism also to say \"There are seven sacraments for men and six for women in our Catholic church\". That would be much more honest.  Rev.

I wanted to save on fuel (spent $600 a month commuting). I needed a minimum range of 130 km, it's math I won't have \"range anxiety\". I did my research, was interested in the Ford Focus EV, used Fords website to search for on at a dealer to test drive, no Focus EV's within 50km. I emailed a dealer close to me,  got a call 2 weeks later - a customer who had ordered an EV changed their mind (wanted more than 185km range) I drove the all Electric Focus and was incredibly impressed, quick, comfortable and fun to drive. I took the $14k govt rebate which brought the car down to $21k, no gas, little maintenance (brakes, ties). We almost exclusively drive the EV, Love the HOV lane by myself. Great car, there should be 000's on the road. Not an ad!",

Many Jews are following Judaism in Israel. Now about settlements. Some settlements exist more than 20 years. They are now well developed cities with civic infrastructure, colleges, hospitals, universities and population from 60 to 200 thousand people.

Here's his conclusion:\n\n\"What 95 percent of all suicide attacks have in common, since 1980, is not religion, but a specific strategic motivation to respond to a military intervention, often specifically a military occupation, of territory that the terrorists view as their homeland or prize greatly. From Lebanon and the West Bank in the 80s and 90s, to Iraq and Afghanistan, and up through the Paris suicide attacks we’ve just experienced in the last days, military intervention—and specifically when the military intervention is occupying territory—that’s what prompts suicide terrorism more than anything else.\"",

This is only for the hours that they teach. This does not include prepping, marking, faculty meetings, students meetings, answering student emails, helping students outside of the class, parking and mandatory training modules. Some part-time teachers don't have a choice to obtain partial load status where the hours and pay are more and are only aloud to teach a maximum of 6 hours.

Once in a while you will see one or two individuals walking around with a sign saying he has a personal firearm for sale but they do so at the risk of BATF scrutiny and lots of times they sell the firearm to an FFL at the show. So in reality this so-called “loophole” is progressive speak for wanting to pass laws to monitor and control  loans, transfers or physical access of firearms, ammunition, or “high capacity” magazines to distant relatives, friends, domestic partners, roommates or other acquaintances you have known for years.

Private insurers obviously don't have this kind of outside or off-budget help.

The massive problem I see is the unwillingness of many companies to invest in training or loyalty to their staff. I'm not suggesting it should be feasible to punch a clock for 40 years at the same place, but social and employment considerations should be a big part of the math as we formulate special tax treatments and support for companies.\n\nMy biggest hope in this conversation is that older folks who also faced real struggles in their youth take the time to actually see how the world today might be tougher - and for a longer period of time - than in the past.

Mr. Pitts seem to believe that any protest against Kaepernick's protest is unjust and that smack in the face of justice itself. Mr. Jamison Paul protested against my comments. You and I have protested against each other often in the past. But that don't make us wrong or evil, does it??",

It fails to protect the rights and liberties of all those people because it was SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to ensure they would never HAVE rights.\n\nTo give them rights - we had to CHANGE the system, and that process is very far from complete.\n\nWe had to destroy a property right to abolish slavery. We had to destroy a property right to redefine marriage into something where women are not bought and sold. We had to destroy a property right to declare that you cannot sell your kids into labour or beat them to death. \n\nClassic liberalism is just nostaligically trying to recreate oppression by subscribing to a system that thought liberty was the exclusive preserve of white men.",

Unexpected events, e.g., a work stoppage beyond HART's control (from strikes, lawsuits and disasters, natural or otherwise) are not in the budget except as a CF item.\n\n2) If funding for HART is cut off, It will mean $billions of Fed funds must be returned and $multi-Million to be spent to terminate existing contracts.

The problem is the dogma of the Catholic Faith about sex, marriage and reproduction is not at all realistic.  It is based on a \"natural law\" not recognizable by scientists of nature and most good theologians and philosopher.  So let the Spirit bring us light.

The 2014 Adjunct Task Force, convened under the direction of CCCS Pres. Nancy McCallin, recommended an immediate 28% pay increase to adjunct faculty. That recommendation was thrown out. A 20% pay raise was okayed for full-time faculty. McCallin's salary has risen 52% since 2009 and is now four times that of Gov. Hickenlooper; FRCC Pres. Dorsey earns twice Hickenlooper's pay.

Among the factors which may help explain Hawaii's low turnout is the absence of competitive races, with the presidential race at the top, but also in down-ticket races. \n\nBTW, I suspect the figure they gave for HI turnout is based upon faulty methodology which includes a count of non-resident military personnel, 99% of whom are registered to vote in other states.\n\nNonetheless, Hawaii has a very low turnout rate. We also are the only state with zero members of the minority party in one of our chambers. Our elections are not competitive. Few people want to vote for Republicans. Voters prefer Democrats, yet that does not produce laws which deliver on the Democratic platform's commitment to working and middle class voters. To paraphrase a bumpersticker, \"Why Vote? It only encourages them.\" \n\nMaybe if voting seemed to make a difference, there's be more of it?",

By this comment you can conclude that they doctored their books.  Yet the Pregeant family still holds the three highest salaries.",

On 2 of the flight segments, Air Canada used a different jet and I was relegated to a 'normal' economy seat. \n\nI brought this to the attention of Air Canada and asked them to provide a seat with more leg room and they went on a mantra about how the incremental fee was for either more leg room or being closer to the front of the jet.  I told them I could care less if it was mid, front or back, I only wanted leg room and I had made my payment for these seats.  I was given the run around.\n\nI am not sure if Air Canada will refund the incremental fee (wait and see if they process a credit).

They also approved the Keystone XL pipeline which was stalled while they were in power thanks to ex-community organizer Barack Obama and which Obama finally vetoed almost immediately after Trudeau was sworn into office. Now things probably will move forward on the Keystone XL pipeline; it would seem more appropriate if that happens to thank Donald Trump rather Trudeau.

Burr, a 22-year veteran of Capitol Hill, framed the investigation as “one of the biggest” he’s seen in his tenure in Washington, D.C.\n\nWarner concurred, saying, “When we started this, we saw the scope, what was involved, I said it was the most important thing I have ever taken on in my public life.

It was an absolutely heart wrenching and compelling production.\n\nSeason 2 returned to the crime to address how the justice system dealt with the killer.  \n\nSeason 3 is about a  49-year old woman who is raped after a party she attends.   Nasty stuff too.  However, what is interesting is that after every episode aired in the UK. there is a 'trigger warning' for people who might find the subject matter too disturbing and where they can get help.

At their worst, she is guilty of accepting donations for personal gain while in the employ of the US government and from donors that are a clear conflict of interest. The taxes of the Clinton Foundation show very clearly that her claim that \"90% of all funds collected go to help causes\" is blatantly false.

Meanwhile, signatures cannot be gathered, which could keep the referendum off the ballot entirely. This encourages the party in power to title unfairly any referendum they oppose.

Most importantly, the Khadr case would if litigated have delineated the extent to which Charter rights can be infringed for the sake of enforcing national security objectives as well as the extent to which one's own behavior can mitigate Charter damages (i.e. moral hazard).

That also means that people will have more disposable income to spend on other areas of the economy.  \n\nTo your point about AE jobs leveling off, that will probably happen but not for a long time and by that time older systems will need to be replaced and maintenance done, rinse and repeat.

Few convents are still available to the Sisters who taught in the parishes. Just as with lay folk, each province has had to make plans for the future. Some overbuilt houses of independent or assisted living, and each death or move to a nursing home emptied the retirement home. One province simply hired a capable nurse to locate the appropriate nursing home anywhere in the state, and have the religious live there alone except for check-up visits, under Medicaid.

In that case buyers were suing the developer to get out of their contracts rather that pay the contracted price for the finished units ( Olympic Village). As I recall the developer went broke and the City of Vancouver lost the money that it was owed for the land that it had sold.  Developers beware - this could happen again and you won't have any satisfaction chasing foreign investors for the completion price in China's courts, nevermind ours.

The water supply rates are significantly lower than the State average and \"on par\" with Springfield.  Again, concerns over the wastewater and stormwater rates should be addressed to the City of Eugene, not to EWEB....all EWEB does is collect the fees for the City.  I feel the EWEB Board is composed of bright, capable individuals and, in terms of holding down rates, the \"low hanging fruit has already been picked.\"  \n\nPlease point out any factual errors in my posts and I'll gladly correct them.  regards, Gary Crum",

But that is not the only understanding of Baptism we have inherited. The East, in particular, has preserved other understandings, above all our incorporation into the new life introduced into the cosmos by the Christ Event. (Recall, that the East was not straddled with Augustine and his conception of Original Sin, and yet they prize Baptism. Obviously, therefore, our Tradition contains alternative conception of Baptism that the West has tended to down play.)\n\nAs for the Immaculate Conception, at the present time I am at a complete loss to make any sense of this particular doctrine.\n\nMay I ask why you dropped Jesuitical?\n\n(END)",

A token reduction of sale acreage or road reconstruction?\n\nThe lamented Umpqua Hot Springs has become an overused and often lawless ecological disaster. Remove the bridge over the river and close the access road to return it to the less used more pristine condition it enjoyed when I first hiked in 45 years ago. That would be a small but real \"victory\"!\n\nHow much have enviro lawyers made from Loafer litigation so far? How much more will additional Forest Service paperwork cost taxpayers? \n\nWhat's up ahead? Will a timber industry friendly congress use this litigation and the many other timber sale law suits to justify privatizing public land or diminishing protective laws?",

In other countries children develop a career path by 8th grade and study for college, trade school, agriculture, family business, or apprenticeship while still taking basic courses. Of course all professions are respected because they are working. This would mean less money would have to be wasted on children bored and uninterested in school. Teacher Unions rob children of educational money. Grading a school or testing grades for efficiency are a waste of time and money. Teachers need to be graded individually by outside peers.

Of course, the church has been reflecting on his teaching, trying to understand and follow it, for more than two thousand years.  We live in the \"time between the times\" -- the \"already\" of the reign of God inaugurated by Jesus and the \"not yet\" of the full realization of God's reign in God's time.  In the time between the times, we seek justice and practice it imperfectly.   In the reign of God, God blends justice and mercy perfectly, because God is Love; but we do it imperfectly.  At least, though, we must keep both in view and recognize the priority of mercy without denying the importance of justice.  What an awesome task, especially for those in the church, charged with ministering to sinners, and those (like you) in civil society, charged with administering justice. (con't.)",

A simple ice rink.  Except that year after year after year, after many attempts by the bright boys of NYC and engineers  repeatedly for 6 years failed miserably in having ice on the rink and wasted $12 million for nothing.  In 1986, Trump wrote a letter to Mayor Koch told him that he could build the ice rink in 6 months.    Get this. Trump built the ice rink in just 4 months, 2 months ahead of schedule. Circumstances made it easy to mock Trump and be a skeptic in 1986. For how could a businessman accomplish what engineers and bright boys of NYC could not?",

Sadly, there is no evidence of that dynamic ever working in the long run. In fact, as an economist, Krugman should know that it is contrary to basic economic principles. When people are getting something for below market price or for free because others are paying the difference, they will tend to use more of it. As that happens, and since there are always limits to tax dollars and the political costs of deficit spending, rationing happens by various means. For Medicaid, it is doctors dropping out of that market, leaving those reliant on it with longer waits and lower quality doctors and care, even as our overall expenditures on Medicare go up.

The Leafs points total was not a fair reflection of their actual abilities. They only had one shootout win all season and would have been better than a wildcard team with even average luck on the front. Some of the  best shootout teams were the worst at ice hockey. Check this out:\n\nhttps://www.sportingcharts.com/nhl/stats/team-shootout-wins-and-losses/2016/\n\nThe first and third best shootout percentages were owned by Detroit and Arizona. Other teams that did well were Vancouver and Winnipeg, neither of whom made the playoffs. Toronto were dead last.  If this doesn't show how ridiculous it is to award the same number of points for winning a shootout as for winning in regulation, nothing will.\n\nSee below-",

Sometimes I get some capital gain, sometimes I don't.\n\nIf you want to compare notes, here goes.  April 28 I bought 585 shares of FN at an ACB of $23.07.  It closed Friday at $25.44.  That is greater than a 10% gain in a month.  The problem is, I really didn't buy FN for the capital gain, I bought it for the sustainable 8% yield.  If I get a capital gain, that is just a bonus.  If the price climbs to the point I feel it is overvalued on a risk/reward basis WRT the yield, I will sell it and purchase something with a greater sustainable yield.  At this point, I will just keep collecting a great dividend.\n\nAs for the size of my 'truck', only my wife knows how big that is.\n\nAs for research, I spend as much time as I need to.

Gravity waves are similar in concept to electromagnetic waves, i.e. radio, light, X-rays, etc.  Gravity, however, is much weaker than electromagnetic forces.  Just as electric current moving back and forth in an antenna creates radio waves, objects moving around each other in orbits emit gravitational waves.  Because gravity is so much weaker than electromagnetic forces, it takes truly massive objects to make gravitational waves we can detect.  Everybody expected gravitational waves to exist, the challenge was to make a receiver sensitive enough to detect them.  Basically no practical importance as far as human existence is concerned.  However, the detection of the gravitational waves is a brilliant feat of experimental physics.",

So one way or another, the taxpayer pays. As for energy, the US already has a sweetheart deal that basically guarantees that country as much oil and gas as they can buy even if it is detrimental to Canadian interests. Now the author wants to open the energy valve even wider. Given that the valves are already fully open, what's to negotiate?

The intent, the circumstances, and therefore the consequences are very different, because the baseline is very different.\n\nWomen have been active socially and religiously from day one in western/Christian society, had an important role in its inception, participating in religious services next to men, instituting and leading religious orders themselves, mixing with men at country fairs and dances and church socials, balls and banquets and court life, organizing dinner parties and salons, etc. It wasn't a stretch to go from this baseline to modern feminism.\n\nMeanwhile, in Muslim countries, women were hidden in back rooms and behind veils and partitions, observers but not participants. That makes it the baseline of \"normal\" fundamentalists want to return to, against \"westernisation\".\n\nMuslim columnists should acknowledge the elephant in the room, not pretend they don't see it, then bemoan \"stereotypes\".",

I would like to challenge Charles Bombardier @ Imaginactive to a Race around the virtual world using Laminar Research's  X-Plane 10 Flight Simulator.  Charles can fly the Paradoxal  and  I will fly my modified  X-Plane ( X-30 ) National Aero Space Plane. I call my plane the Aurora and I believe that it is the fastest civilian/military plane in the virtual aviation world.  I was able to fly the Aurora with a payload of 220 passengers+flight crew on a non-stop flight from London Heathrow, UK to Mumbai, India to Sydney, Australia  ( Distance:  10,800 miles,  Cruise altitude:  350,000 Ft ASL ,  Cruise airspeed:  Mach 32  or  22,400 mph )  Total trip time:  50 minutes or less than  1 hour.  The Aurora does not produce a Sonic boom nor will it burn up on reentry from Low Earth Orbit.  Cheers,  Randall",

Thus implying somehow that the assets of the diocese were separate from work and beneficence of the laity.\n- Canon law requires that each parish be its own separate civil entity. However in almost all US dioceses the parishes are part and parcel of the 'bishop, corporate', or some other civil entity that can be manipulated in similar manner.\n- So, the short answer is, parish assets are not immune from liquidation. Further, it is conceivable that the bankruptcy court can take a percentage of each collection in the parish to meet the diocese's legal obligation. Legislatures certainly can lay a legal foundation to further enable this.",

The seem to LOVE projecting the sense that they represent something bigger than themselves, but the question can be asked \"what?\"\n\nThis isn't obvious.  Do they represent some kind of idea, as developed and put forth by their brother bishops?   Do they represent the body of their brother bishops?  Are they claiming to represent those who are Baptized and hit all the rules like Sunday Mass, or perhaps all those who were baptized, whether or not now fallen away?  \n\nI think there is a growing sense of disassociation here.  Clearly, their actions on the scandal do NOT represent the laity.  When they jump into politics, I think it fair to suggest that on any given day, a LOT of people (either party) will be upset.

Equality was only meant to mean that everybody is born with the same inherent rights, and that there could be no such thing as a man born to be a king, who then would have the inherent right to rule over another.  When government proclaims that one class of persons are to be protected from failure, while another class of persons are being allowed to fail, that by definition is rejecting the very spirit of what it means to have liberty and freedom in the first place.",

Angus McElvey amended the pesticide disclosure bill in a manner designed to prevent its passage while pretending to be a supporter of the original intent of the bill and \"just improving it.\" I think he did this in close consultation with lobbyists and representatives of the industry. The strongest evidence is to look at the final draft of the bill, paying specific attention to his amendments. Where the original bill was aimed at the largest users of restricted use chemicals, those most capable of meeting the notification and filing requirements of the bill, industry advocates have been blowing smoke that they are being unfairly singled out and the requirements should apply to everyone who uses pesticides, even in small amounts and even \"over-the-counter\" pesticides and not just those classified as \"restricted.\"",

Instead they reflect the neoliberal philosophy of purists and secular puritans who shape policy around the ideal society they would like to see rather than the reality of society as it is. The result is less and less public support for their policies and their parties. \nThose who wear full body covering are not interested in integration. They want a parallel society within Quebec.

Brown's election meant Democrats could no longer break a filibuster in the Senate.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Healthcare_debate.2C_2008.E2.80.9310",

The Saker writes, \"Maybe Tulsi Gabbard will run on a campaign promise of peace. Our next hope for somebody sane in the White House in 2020.\"  However more missiles in Hawaii is not a sane idea or one that leads to peace. Someone is giving Tulsi bad advice, and think that there is a realistic concern as to if the world will last to 2020 with the lack of sane, humane leadership in the USA Government.",

My question to Pierre de Vos:\n\nIn SA Contract Law and Law of Delict can one not argue the following:\n\nThere are legal consequences, for false advertising or false promises. Why can it not be extended to religious leaders, for accountability and fines or punishments thereof? \n\nFalse Promises are improper influence, and misrepresentation, brought about by intentional or unintentional errancy, mistake, delusion, fallacy or aberrancy, to move a person to act to his detriment or disadvantage, and is a miscarriage of justice. These harmful acts are seen as civil wrongs. Does the law not state that a civil wrong can result in liability and may give rise to payment of damages as compensation?\n\nFraud is a deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, and a hoax is a deliberately fabricated falsehood made to masquerade as the truth. \n\nWhy would you then say it is permissible by SA law, if false promises and fraud are seen as civil wrongs?",

But must pay for work already done and expenses incurred but no more at this time. We did need this incentive as Cook Inlet was out of gas but incentivized drilling has brought us energy security. As to the PFD used to pay government costs, the costs must be cut back to bare minimum. The PFD is for the benefit of the people so can be spent on necessary government for the people. So a tapering off of government, oil incentive, and PFDs is the right thing for Alaska. Also the mega projects including gas pipeline stopped for now.",

I suspect the real reason blacks didn't come to Oregon prior to WWII in any significant numbers is because there was nothing for them to come to Oregon for.  I seriously doubt blacks were even aware of the law, hence not an effective deterrent for moving to Oregon and basically useless in making blacks leave if they came.\n\nMostly what is written about these laws are the existence of them and a lot of postulating about them.",
