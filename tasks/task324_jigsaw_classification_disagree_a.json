The reason there are not more studies(after 18 years -it's not new)  is because they will show that it is acually worse for patients. It's a selling tool. That's it. The biggest scam of the century! It's not \"completely under the surgeons control\". It's software driven. It controls the \"tremors\" of the surgeon hands. It does not differentiate between tremor and slight purposefull surgeon movements. Fact. What about the 60+ recalls in the USA for this one product? What about the fact that it leaks electricity out of the view of the surgeon causing unrecognized thermal injuries? What about the company knowing this since 2007 and not recalling the parts until they secured a patent and had \"improved\" parts ready to ship? What about the company not reporting serious injuries or the 250+ deaths until the FDA did a probe in 2013? 3000 lawsuits they are settling ---ever single case?

And while the formal acceptance of those racist policy may be gone for the most part, the emotional imprinting of grandparent, parents, friends certainly keeps racism alive at the individual level.  \n\nPeace",

It is natural, then, that the careerist will do all in his power to protect the kingdom he has struggled so hard to build up.  We all know that this has absolutely nothing to do with Jesus or the gospel or the Reign of God, but they don't know that (or maybe they do and have just sold out).  The Catholic Church as an institution led by careerists is dying a slow death.  It is too bad, no, it is tragic, that the faithful priests of Ireland and elsewhere are the martyrs who must endure the corruption of a system that is crumbling before our very eyes.  The good news, however, is that there are Catholic and ecumenical groups sprouting up everywhere that are worshiping in inclusive communities, working for justice, and participating in all types of important ministries.

Those plans are still up in the air. \nRepealing the Law of Gravity has been a goal of Republicans since the First Great Awakening in 1739.

They are on \"on staff\" so that's why they are not listed in the staff box. They are contractors or freelancers who we pay on a per-piece basis. However, they do go through the editing process as any other staff writer would. Community Voices are like op-eds in what you call \"a real newspaper.\"  Submissions by a variety of voices and they do not get paid so we edit them only for style and grammar etc. Brett's column has a title, \"Reader Rep,\" not because he represents CB but because it gets at what he is trying to write about ... helping readers better understand how the media works. That is his only subject so it has a name, like Health Beat or Hawaii Teacher.",

Okay, I get the part about capital seeking the best returns. But Canada has never been a \"socialistic\" society. Instead, since WWII it's largely functioned on the basis of what's called a \"mixed-market\" economy, where governments function and regulate to promote and protect the public interest. Our public healthcare system is in fact vastly more efficient than the American model in economic terms and abandoning the government's oversight and regulatory role helped to precipitate the 2008/09 crash in the U.S., leading to negative global consequences.

Interesting to note that the body of JP I is placed in one of the deepest points of the Vatican in a double coated lead casket.  Modern forensics indeed might detect likely cyanide in his bones.

Walker steals the PFD and then gives it to big oil, who have had record profits.  We the people need to be represented, and big oil needs to pay it's fair share, and if they don't want to develop their leases, and are just setting on them to keep other competitors from developing and competing with the big oils other developed fields, then we need to take these leases back and lease them to companies that will develop them.

Savings of $120 may not be worth the aggravation.\n\nOnce her debts are gone, about 8 months after her mortgage is gone, she would have about $16,000 a year to invest, plus what she is putting in her TFSA/RRSP's now.

Canada cannot permit the root cause of our damage to cross border. \n\nAs for me I will no longer visit the U.S., for any reason.",

Finally and thankfully, a pope is awakening to this historical fact (and, similtaneously, implying the historical fallibility of S&T).\n\nFor us as Christians, the issue has to do with what Jesus himself teaches about it, not with anything else. You, surely, as a 'faithful' Catholic (which presumably means you count yourself as a follower of Jesus) can see this, can't you? Can't you? Well, no, you can't, actually.

It is a 1-game playoff still fair?

Wisdom literature reveals an ability to be patient with mystery and contradictions—and the soul itself. Wise people have always passed through a major death to their egocentricity. This is the core meaning of transformation.\nWe have to go through interior deaths to reach the third stage of wisdom. Only here does contemplation and nondual thinking become possible; we can begin to learn to live with mystery and paradox and to develop true compassion. If stage one is order and stage two is disorder, then stage three is the final goal of reorder. There is no way around stage two! It is what Paul calls “the folly of the cross” (1 Corinthians ‪1:18‬).

In the NFL there is so much that a Qb has to be able to do. Ok so he hasn't been able to do it in 2 years, big deal, he deserves at least one more year to prove he can capitalize on all that athletic ability, I still believe he has a chance to be really good, he is an investment. \n\nMoving on though, clearly Trevor should be the starter, I like him he could get us into the playoffs, but I just don't see us getting to and winning a SB with him. I hope I'm wrong about that. \n\nThe future, all depends on Trevor this year, if be plays really well, he will get a contract, if he doesn't he will get traded, and it will be either this next year with Lynch and Kelly or Lynch will also get traded and Elway will go out and get a big name Qb via free agency or trade. My prediction for this year: somewhere between 9-7 and 11-5 with the possibility of one playoff win at home.",

It's okay to hound this kid mercilessly for participating in a time-honored tradition of his people, apparently. If one of them showed up at his door and started kicking him, would we say it was fine for them to do so because the kid holds an opinion about hunting that is correctly politically incorrect?\n\nConversely, if the kid finally had enough and showed up at a rally against bowhead whaling and started throwing punches, would we say \"Oh, that's okay, because he's a member of a protected class and so he's allowed to perpetrate violence against someone he disagrees with\"?\n\nAggression is wrong ALWAYS. Violence to protect oneself from physical harm is allowable. Just because you hold a PC opinion, doesn't mean you have a right to aggress on others.",

It's been a role model for one-sided thinking--of using  intense anger to shut out any other viewpoints--of half-hour rants.  It's empowered people who have difficulty with the complexity of hearing others.\nThere was the Contract with America of 1994--which sounds mild and reasonable.  But after it was accepted Newt Gingrich said that the GOP couldn't govern properly unless they controlled the 3 branches of government.  This was an incentive to radical conservatives who were previously very marginalized because our federal government is set up so the 3 branches HAVE to work together for our government to function properly.  \nThere are even earlier precedents.\nPeople have ignored this",

Agents have done great for themselves especially as prices go up (remember, they are paid a percentage of the sale price) but nothing goes on forever.  Steps taken to cool the market are necessary because if the market crashes, it will not be the real-estate agents that will have to bear the fallout.  Over-extended buyers losing their home, mortgage insurance firms (including the government backed one), the banks, and if it is a very bad situation, the government (which means taxpayers) which guarantees the banks will all be on the victims.

So where does that leave all the believers today in regards to the gift of prophecy and inspired writings, or rather, are believers less gifted than she was? I don't think so. Believing we are less gifted would be denying the indwelling Spirit of God.

A young African American was in the news because she'd been cut on her face from forehead to chin and he said (matter.of.fact like): she probably deserved it.  That was the last time and I walked away from everyone in my family.  I stand in solidarity w/ all those who are the object of this kind of evil.",

Rumney draws two conclusions from his review of literature. First, the police continue to misapply the \"no-crime\" or \"unfounding\" criteria. Studies by Kelly et al. (2005), Lea et al. (2003), HMCPSI/HMIC (2002), Harris and Grace (1999), Smith (1989), and others found that police decisions to no-crime were frequently dubious and based entirely on the officer's personal judgment. Rumney notes that some officers seem to \"have fixed views and expectations about how genuine rape victims should react to their victimization.\" He adds that \"qualitative research also suggests that some officers continue to exhibit an unjustified scepticism of rape complainants, while others interpret such things as lack of evidence or complaint withdrawal as 'proof' of a false allegation.\"- Wikipedia\n\nThe problem appears real, and not confined to Canada.",

Our Eugene-based language assessment company, Avant Assessment conducts proficiency assessments in Lexington as it does in Eugene. Lexington shows that it is possible to provide effective language programs for all students. \n\nOne way to increase graduation rates in Oregon is to do what Washington and other sates do - award competency-based credits to students who demonstrate proficiency in the  heritage language skills that they developed at home. A Gates Foundation funded study by Education NW in the Seattle area showed that this program increased graduation rates among heritage Spanish speaking students by 5.26%.",

Simultaneously, we’ve purchased well over 200 million firearms while U.S. criminal violence declined to the lowest levels in 40 years, almost the lowest ever recorded.  Seems as more and more people buy and carry firearms, criminal violence plummets.  Brown doesn't want Oregon voters to know those facts.  And thus far, they don't.",

Canadian oil producers can actually use U.S. port facilities to ship their crude oil to other countries (U.S. law allows for exports of Canadian oil as long as they aren't mingled with U.S. products). Around two million barrels of mostly heavy oil from Canada's oil sands have been exported from the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2014.

The article is based on a straw man fallacy.\n\nWhen Gord Downie wrote his film about Charlie Wenjak, he was praised by the some of the same aboriginal people who are in an uproar now -- because he did his research and talked with aboriginal people who had an interest to make sure the story he told was an accurate and respectful representation, not cultural appropriation.\n\nWhen Emily Carr painted images of aboriginal totem poles, she went to the communities and learned about their significance before painting them -- and in her unique style that was European influenced.  That's not appropriation, it's sharing.  \n\nAnd that's a whole different thing that that \"artist\" who simply appropriates the style and imagery of Morriseau for her own use.",

Is a CA firm could get office space at 50% of the usual price, it too could pay more to staff (or perhaps just pocket a larger profit). \n\nMy response would be \"what other projects do we, as Calgary, have planned, rather than responding to a glitzy developer's proposal full of \"plucked from air\" (\"PFA\" to Chartered Accountants) numbers ***that have not been independently reviewed for achievability nof assumptions and information used.***",

They voted to investigate whether or not this community is interested in PP.  The board will try to discover what the majority of the people want and vote appropriately in relation to PP.  I personally disagree with you and feel PP provides an option for people's health care.  They serve men as well you know.  \n\nKeep your talking points though, the $300 million and CEO salaries. I for one would hope an organization as large as PP would financially compensate at a competitive level to attract and retain talent.  Especially at the executive level.",

Fake news before fake news was a thing. \n\nI'm actually not disputing that there are a few fringe elements who enjoy bullying people. The biggest problem is suggesting this is somehow unique to the progressive segment of society. As I have already pointed out, capitalists (most corporations) and right-wingers are just as happy to abuse their power. The second problem is that your straw man suggests that these groups are equal now, when there is much data showing otherwise. It's not hard to find, so feel free. \n\nAs power shifts from one group to another, they tend to behave in similar ways. When the right-wing is in ascendancy, it also uses power inappropriately. One example is voter suppression in the Southern states. Another is the sharp uptick in anti-Muslim commentary (+ violence!). \n\nAnyone arguing that this is the province of either Right OR Left can only be a partisan. Go back to your Orwell!",

The problem is they were encouraged to expand their industry and now too much milk being produced (largely by corporate farms) to the point of dumping millions of gallons of it.  In Wisconsin there are ~1200 dairy farmers; in some cases one state has more farms than all of Canada.

As a side note, in two centers in Alberta the Catholic system is the public system with  Protestant Separate Schools as a compliment.\n\nThis system has worked well - the issue regarding the instruction of sex education will end up being one which accepts all people for who they are, not what they are.  This was the prevalent attitude when I formally taught in the Catholic system in Alberta.\n\nAs a side note, when I first applied to a Catholic school board, I was required to have a letter of reference from our Parish Priest.

It would be antithetical to their shared communal life if they did not share the vow of celibacy. Finally, it would not seem that parish priests give up sexual expression because it is demanded by the people. They do so because it is demanded by the Tradition of the Church, which seeks to carry out the will of God. Aside from centuries of celibate clergy, there is much Biblical precedence for this. Mt 19:12, Lk 20:33-35 and 1 Corinthians 7, especially verses 8-9, which touch on points mentioned here. Regarding 1 Cor 7:8-9, it is important to note that God seems to call those to the priesthood who do \"practice self-control\" and are not \"aflame with [sexual] passion.\"\n\nFinally, it is important not to be trapped in a rather recent Western paradigm that asserts, implicitly or directly, that sexual expression is necessary for happiness.",

A 6% tax today will eventually need to be a 30% tax if we maintain the same level of State government we have today. How do I know that? I attended the budget brainstorming Walker had here in Fairbanks two years ago. The math worked out that, without oil revenues, every income producer in the State would need to pay 30% tax to support the current level of government services.\n\nSo, I did the math. Currently, I wouldn't be paying much under the income tax, but I already pay 25% to the feds. In 10 years, if oil decline continues and state services remain at current levels, we will all be paying 30%. That PFD will mean nothing to me at that point because, if my income remains steady, I'll be bankrupt and living in a ditch.\n\nReducing the PFD for three years won't kill you and it, along with cuts, will balance the budget in five years.",

Or, as in the case of winners and losers, the opposition has been vanquished by the overriding power of the pro-forces. Because you know whenever something like this comes up again (and it might), the pro forces are ready with their chequebooks and their lobbyist forms to be sure the outcome, again, goes their way.",

The text for bracket 10 reads:  \"(J) More than $25 million, the minimum tax is $30,001 plus 2.5% of the excess over $25 million.\" (this replaces the current laws' bracket of: \"$50 million or more, but less than $75 million, the minimum tax is $50,000.\").\n\nSo it's perfectly logical and theoretically correct that raising prices to cover the \"cost\" of the gross receipts tax elevates gross receipts eventually resulting in more tax if receipts push over a bracket limit or are already over the $25 million which triggers the 2.5% tax on the excess.\n\nOf course price hikes will exceed the tax so that even more tax paid still results in higher profits.

It's been used on most higher end phones ever since(excluding iphone).\n\n---\n\nBecause Samsung has dominated the AMOLED mobile screen production market, Apple rather focused on higher density displays.  Lately, LG(who dominates the television space for OLEDs), has been venturing into the mobile screen space which hopefully will put pressure on Samsung to lower their prices.\n\nI'm glad Apple is finally making the switch.  While their displays have always been good, the color contrast and black levels of AMOLED are a whole other level.

First, my experience suggests people self-identify today for reasons of pride in their Hawaiian ancestors.

If they are putting in a DWDM network, they may provide up to 10 or in the newest systems 25 Gb/sec service.  But here is something to remember, a reasonably good hard drive has a maximum write speed of about 100 MB/s so that a computer could not keep up with saving incoming files at any fiber speed greater than about 800 Mb/sec.   Just because somebody got software companies (whose software coders often do not understand much about hardware data transport) to say they needed fiber does not mean they really do.  With cable level speeds a 1 GB file can be transferred in 6.6 seconds (approx).  Not bad.

In addition, we need to catch up on the  years overdue tax audit that have always revealed that the state was getting short changed in large amounts.  Big oil has always made higher profits in Alaska than elsewhere. In 2007 Conoco Phillips netted $28 per barrel in AK vs $9 in the lower 48 and $6 world wide.",

Back in the 70s a drug dealer named Jeffery Edmonson actually filed a tax return (after being convicted of trafficking) for his illegal drug business. Due to that the IRS brought about the 280E. That is what is used for cannibis (even medical, physicians,retail, all of them) businesses. Under the 280E about 80% of the normal deductions a business can take are not allowed resulting in an extremely higher taxable income. The cannibis industry pays a very large amount more than any other industry. This article has a great explanation of it. \nhttps://thecannabisindustry.org/uploads/2015-280E-White-Paper.pdf",

A bit of hyperbole, including sarcasm, is about all which can be presented in 250 words.  Convincing arguments take a bit longer.  We're not talking a \"Intelligence Squared\" debate here.  ......though it would be fun to have some of those debates with others from this site.  Get to organizing........regards, Gary Crum",

The ethical project is about becoming oneself. How does one do this? Only by developing virtues like temperance, courage, prudence, generosity, justice, ect.  This fits well into a Christian context since Christ said that sin enslaves us to itself. Virtues are the by which we free ourselves to become ourselves to the highest degree possible.

Traditional Time-of-Day signal timing plans do not accommodate variable and unpredictable traffic demands.......With ASCT, information is collected and signal timing is updated continually.\"\n\"The main benefits of adaptive signal control technology over conventional signal systems are that it can:\n    * Continuously distribute green light time equitably for all traffic movements\n    * Improve travel time reliability by progressively moving vehicles through green lights\n    * Reduce congestion by creating smoother flow\n    * Prolong the effectiveness of traffic signal timing\"",

There is a great need to revisit the stories on which much of our faith is based, certainly the basic Garden of Eden stories, ideas of original sin, ideas of what is a sin, the idea that the Jewish faithful were more precious to God than all others He imbued with human life, the idea that the Bible is God's Word, rather than the wisdom of the ages and the cultures in which the stories were written.  \n\nWe need a mythology and philosophy that recognizes we evolved and are evolving, that we cannot \"know\" God, even though He put a yearning in our minds and hearts to seek Him.   We have to be able to admit we can only find some aspect of God in imperfect forms of metaphor and allegory and we need to be able to take new knowledge and adapt/change/create the metaphor and allegory that reflects our new understandings.  In other words, there is no infallible-for-all-time dogma.  \n\nWe need to learn to be humble.  Some need that lesson rather badly.",

No Native Hawaiian is eligible in the federal statute for anything whatsoever. All the money scammed from the federal treasury by Senator Dan Inouye goes to the state for Hawaiian programs. The use of Native instead of native is itself a violation of federal law as it incorporates a racial group, as per Rice v Cayetano.

The annual fuel cost is a fraction of the yearly interest paid on a $10 billion loan.\n\nBy example, would you buy a $250,000 car that ran on water and lasts 100 years instead of a $25,000 car that burned gas and lasts 20 years?  Especially if the gas cost $2,000/yr but the interest on a $250,000 loan was $10,000/yr?  And what if I told you the $250 K car may end up costing $400 K, but when you find this out you'll be on the hook for $100 K which you won't get back.

Comparing auto licensing (and driver licensing) with that for bikes demonstrates how ridiculous a notion this is.  How many people are killed by cyclists?  Cyclists tend to be the ones killed, so what problem is licensing solving?  How much property damage do cyclists cause?  That is a major reason for licencing cars, drivers and requiring insurance - how would that make sense for cyclists and again, what problem are you trying to solve?  I too have been cycling, and driving, for near on 40 years, mostly without bike lanes and never on sidewalks.  Change the rules for cyclists to make some sense (rolling stops at stop signs) and then enforce all other regular rules of the road.  That is all that needs to be done.",

The disparity gets even wider when benefits and (especially) pensions are considered.  A 3-year freeze, for example, is not even a very severe measure when you start out 25% ahead.  That might let the private workers close up, say, one quarter of the gap.  So I will shed no tears for the union head.\nIt is true, however, that the managerial ranks, especially in the medical area, are even more overpaid than the rank-and-file union staff.  So how about a \"progressive\" pay cut?  15% above $200k, zero at $40k, and a sliding scale in between.  The more you make, the bigger the (%) cut.   That would preserve as much as possible of spending and jobs, while seriously denting the budget deficit.",

They are domesticated even the cottontail rabbit is a hare. The balance of nature becomes disturbed when the less elusive \"rabbit\" is introduced into nature. They are easier prey. They don't have the instinct and blending ability that hares do. An example: a black rabbit in the snow. Freeze rabbit, but I can still see you! I think the snowshoe hare becomes overpopulated because they are harder to catch by prey animals than the easy, tasty rabbits. This can lead to loss of food source to support new hares. Then hare population decreases and what happens to the predators that have eaten all the rabbits and the hares have starved which decreases the population for predators to eat!",

You start with a claim that investors specifically in factor-based indexes take bigger risks, but end up with \"Those who wish to beat the market often jump around. They chase past winners.\" which is a reflection of a type of investor behaviour not of any risk particular to factor-based funds. Second, the performance comparisons you cite are flawed in that they do not consider the relative volatility of each fund's returns. Whether the particular funds were actually better or worse bets than passive indexing would depend on their Sharpe/Sortino ratios and whether the investor was able to appreciate that the returns would not correlate 100% to an index benchmark. Ultimately all you've demonstrated is the tautology that those who choose bigger risks face bigger risks, which is hardly a novel observation. You also haven't identified  the risks index investors took during the sample period that didn't materialize but might in future returns.",

A civil reporting law and a canonical prohibition of absolution can work together to discourage this use (or abuse) of the sacrament.  A civil reporting law is useless if the confessor doesn’t know who the penitent is. A canonical prohibition, if widely publicized, will be much more effective because the abuser will know that it is pointless going to confession if he knows that absolution will be refused until he hands himself in.

Under my definition, NFP is most certainly a contraceptive method. It is practiced by couples who want to have intercourse, but do not want to conceive. Otherwise, why would they bother with it?\n\nHV also says that it is based on natural law. The magisterium knows this because it knows what natural law is. How does it know this?

They use that event as an excuse to re-state the claim that the “free market” does a better job of allocating development capital than a government institution ever can. (Never mind that the Chinese government had specifically begun to directly subsidize the production of solar panels at essentially that very same time.) With regards to that claim, I ask the following four questions.\n\n1) Did it ever occur to the wags that -- since many more ventures backed by the “free markets” fail than do succeed, and that to call this “good” because it winnows out the losers -- it is hypocritical to apply a “no failures rule” ONLY when a government-backed venture fails?\n\n2) Did it ever occur to these same wags that many of our renewable energy ventures fail, or lose ground to those from other countries, because those other countries heavily subsidize them, almost as a matter of necessity?",

There is a condition called pica which is a specific form of this condition typically related to iron deficiency.   Also, a lot of women crave certain foods during pregnancy they would not otherwise want to eat.   \n\nI'm not sure why medical science accepts nutritional deficiency as the basis for medical conditions in these specific cases (pica, pregnancy related cravings), and rejects it as a possible contributor to overeating and weight gain.

That brings a host of other issues such as poor transportation, poor public services and high crime. A better approach to the supply issue rezoning and re-balance the above land use ratio (urban density). Detached homes will become rare and more expensive, but affordable options like townhouse will be in greater supply and more affordable. For example, duplexes in Vancouver are now >$1M! because of supply does not meet demand. Canada's largest cities will need to ween themselves off the detached house.",

Briefly, I'd suggest capitalism's foundation of endless growth and exploitation of resources on a finite Planet is hugely to blame.  Big Oil has known the effects of it's pollution on the atmosphere and oceans for decades yet hid it to keep the train rolling, blocking alternatives. There is evidence the Bush family was involved in keeping Tesla's free radiant energy discoveries hidden, so oil could prosper.  There are misconceptions about population that cannot be explained in a sentence, but \"common knowledge\" fails to accurately capture the global realities in this area.  Demographers know that the world population will peak near 8 Billion and then decline, for example.  And a small proportion of wealthy people use up and waste too many resources, while corporations are allowed to pollute with impunity.  Hubris is a problem, but who's hubris is worst?  What about the military?",

We've seen more of his embarrassing behavior -- his antics with World Wrestling Entertainment, his making out with Giuliani in drag. (Seriously! Look it up on YouTube!) \nWe also know that his documented ties to organized crime were hardly mentioned, if at all, by the so-called \"media elite\" during the presidential campaign. You're right -- that IS pretty biased!\nLuckily we can trust such sterling, unbiased news sources as FOX, InfoWars, Newsmax, and Brietbart to hold Trump accountable, can't we? (continued)",
