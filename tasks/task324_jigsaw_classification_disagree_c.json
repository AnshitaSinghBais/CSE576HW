Some 20th Century historical events to demonstrate this are: In 1954, the US Supreme Court outlawed segregation in educational institutions. U.S. Bishops in 1958 concluded that enforced segregation could not be reconciled with the Christian view of the human person.  This weak response offered no concrete guidance or recommendations for implementation.  Other Christian denominations were much more specific---denouncing the Ku Klux Klan, and promising the integration of their church facilities.  During Vatican II---only two American bishops cited 'Race Relations' as a problematic issue in their nation. In 1962, only 9 Catholic laity journeyed from Chicago to Albany, Georgia to support a local effort against racial segregation.  This was \"the largest group of American Catholics that participated in the non-violent movement.\"",

I work for my money and I can do what I want with it.  Grab me one more time----and I'll knock you out, priest or no priest.\"  That incident occurred more than 84 years ago.

There are people without the mental aptitude, health or physical ability to make it in today's society.  But a program like this also creates a disincentive.  It's not so much that people are lazy, but some able-bodied, healthy people, to put it politely, are willing to work, but not at any job that they could actually get. But that's why a pilot study is good.  I'd be curious to see how well people on a guaranteed income versus traditional welfare transition over a period of years in terms of dependency, personal welfare and self-sustainability.  There may well be a 'net benefit' to society in terms of the cost of this versus other programs.  And, it's also been shown that giving money to people who spend it, versus stick it in the bank, provides a boost to the economy.",

They built a ship, that subsequently they decided to sell for $1,750,000.  But in order to sell it, they had to spend $3,000,000.   Now they still have to repay the $12,000,000 grant money. So the borough just donated $12,000,000 to a shipwright and paid to refurbish someone else's boat for them.\n\nIf they would have just scuttled the damn thing they would have saved $1,250,000.  Seriously, a million dollars would have been made by just blowing up the boat. They could have done it this coming Monday as part of the valley's version of a fireworks display - allowing, of course, people to shoot at it while it burns for funsies.\n\nWhat ever happened to that 4:20 song they used to play on the radio \"Ooout in Wasilla!\"?",

The sandbagging used to be on the order of $3B to $5B/year, but Trudeau's Liberals have expanded this to close to $10B/year.\n\nSo the announced deficits are up around $30B, but the anticipated deficit is only about $20B.\n\n... of course the real question we should be asking is why are we running a deficit when we're pretty much at the peak of a global economic cycle?  Standard Keynesian economics says we should be making BIG cuts in government spending right now to prepare for the next recession that will be coming sooner than we would like.",

The very best neighbourhoods in Toronto and around the world have a mix of density and use - Leaside, Forest Hill, The Kingsway to name 3.  The objective of planning, zoning and taxes should be to vastly increase supply of mid-to higher rise housing along all major routes in Toronto, well beyond the current activity.  There's virtually nothing but retail and one floor walk-ups along Bloor from the St. George subway to Islington.

(I know the 700,000 isn't the correct #, but it should be close.) According to all I've read, we have a budget deficit of $4 BB, so the PFD grab only covers about 15-20% of the deficit. Juneau still needs an income tax, and maybe a sales tax as well. But what has happened is that the people of AK now have $700 MM less income. How does that affect our economy? I would think it has a huge negative impact. If we can't get Juneau to cut the budgets now, there is no chance they will become fiscally responsible after they raid the PFD. Cut the budgets first, take 8-10% across the board this year and kill all the pet, boondoggle projects previously mentioned.",

The question that the great theologian Arias was posing was that ONLY the Father was un-begotten, and that Jesus was created.  Arius DID BELIEVE that Jesus as SON possessed a dignity superior to everyone else.  Arius was very persuasive among the Greek bishops.  Since the unity of Christianity was at stake here, the Emperor Constantine was hoping for someone to come forward with a solution to the problem.  A solution came from a bright young deacon attending the council, whose name was Athanasius.  Athanasius believed that an article of faith was needed and then he presented three concepts that the Council Fathers could accept 1) The Son was 'homoiousious' 'of like substance with the Father.",

Four plants won't be a problem.\n\nThe whole impaired driving thing is a red herring. First, there's no proof that stoned driving needs to be prevented; the evidence tends to support the conclusion that being stoned simply does not make you a more dangerous driver.

You never saw ruts like these in the 60's and 70's and studded tires were the norm then, not the exception.  Lane traffic density was the same; the Glen was a two lane highway then, everything drove them.

The notion of a \"shortage of STEM majors\" is mostly just a myth, concocted by greedy employers who want a cheap supply of labor.

The humanities students may actually subsidize the rest of the university.  \n\nThe humanities have probably hurt themselves by degenerating into somewhat ridiculous subject matter.

Our quirks are different--under the right circumstances, a party with 40% of the popular vote can win a majority of the seats in parliament--but the effect is the same. Democratic elections operate under a sets of rules, and the fair and square winner of elections are those who win by those rule. \n\nThe essence of a stable democracy is that the winners under the rules that prevail at the time of an election are accepted by the populace as legitimate.

For the next four years we won't even have that to guide us. It's going to be rough ride.

While federally recognized tribes generally are not subordinate to states, they can have a government-to-government relationship with these other sovereigns, as well. \n\nFurthermore, federally recognized tribes possess both the right and the authority to regulate activities on their lands independently from state government control.  They can enact and enforce stricter or more lenient laws and regulations than those of the surrounding or neighboring state(s) wherein they are located. Yet, tribes frequently collaborate and cooperate with states through compacts or other agreements on matters of mutual concern such as environmental protection and law enforcement. \"\nhttps://www.bia.gov/frequently-asked-questions",

Yes, parents had a difficult time getting on the base and participating in their children's education.   Here is my question:   Since a majority of the (current) ASD schools are grouped in the area near the Government Hill Gate, why can't the land be deeded over to the Municipality?   Clearly, that is what happened with Government Hill School.    The official fence and \"gate\" can be moved beyond the ASD buildings, and access would be easier for civilians and school personnel.   Military parents would have no problem going in and out.  The federal government has already combined and downsized JBER and might be amenable.

In this, Clark's Libs failed.\n\nThe last time the NDP was in power here, they didn't do such a great job and I don't trust them, but even so, they have a lot to do to fix what Clark did.

Gender dysphoria is a good step, but inadequate because it does not define what it is about the ‘male’ that a “female” wants to be, or the ‘female’ that a “male” thinks she is.

IF we truly want to accomplish two worthy goals, 1) make it easier for people to travel, whether to work, shop or for recreation AND 2) reduce auto traffic, carbon consumption, parking, etc., we should reduce rather than raise the bus fare.\n\nIMO, toll roads create inconveniences and administrative costs. I think raising the price of driving is most easily handled by increasing a fuel tax, both to create a disincentive for driving and to raise revenue to subsidize the integrated mass transit system. An increased gas tax allows people to save money IF they hop on the Bus.\n\nIt is often objected that a gas tax is regressive, shifting the tax burden to people who live far away, are forced to commute long distances and often drive older, less fuel-efficient cars. The regressivity of a gas tax can be offset by lowering taxes on low income residents and/or providing a tax credit for low income people.",

Simply saying single pay will fix it all is just like aca saying you will save $2500 a year and can keep your doctor.",

As of right now, Mueller has not yet produced this evidence, and is in an actual state of contempt of court in whatever court is overseeing his case.  We need to know the name of the judge that has jurisdiction over his activities, because that judge is also now breaking the law for not having issued a contempt violation on this matter, and is subject to impeachment for as long as he refuses to obey the law (this is all settled law)  That judge that has been issuing the search warrants also needs to be exposed.",

That whole Republican \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" ideal.  Those jobs are gone, stop wishing for something that is no more and figure out how to move forward, instead of looking back.  Even if manufacturing were to come back, much of it will be automated, which means far fewer workers, and much higher skilled workers.  those same workers who can't compete now, still won't be able to compete.",

That's a third of a billion dollars of taxpayer money not going to hospitals, schools, etc. But somehow $10,000 in public funds to support an opera is both misplaced and deserving of scorn? Now, there are many arguments in support of public funding for stadiums...but please bear in mind those same arguments apply to the arts.\n\nAs an aside, I respectfully request you begin posting under your real name.

The best rate to make up for these factors is the US U-6 rate-- often called the \"Real Unemployment Rate\" which adds to \"unemployed\" the people who have a sought a job but cannot get a job \"discouraged workers\", plus it picks up part time workers who have to work for economic reasons (they are counted as unemployed because they cannot find full time employment).

Thirty years later he is the President Elect of the United States and Spy magazine is no more. According to “Trump Revealed” (p.114) Trump “told the News’ Liz Smith [in September 1988] that Spy would close in a year; Spy embraced the prediction and added a monthly feature: a countdown to its own extinction…Trump’s prediction of Spy’s demise eventually proved right; the magazine briefly folded in 1994, then closed for good in 1998.” Trump was only out by four years in predicting that Spy would close, as he never said it wouldn’t reopen again. No-one knows who will lose their job first, Trump as POTUS or La Renzetti as Globe typist. However if I were a betting man I would bet that La Renzetti is gone from the Globe before Trump leaves the White House.",

If someone pushes the envelope on an ESA consultation to make the case that the species will absolutely be in jeopardy with no reasonable and prudent alternatives, a project cannot be permitted, unless it gets an exemption from the 'god squad' in D.C. Past judgments that \"no reasonable and prudent alternatives exist\" have been very rare.  But if one uses projections and discretion out to nearly 100 years, and concludes that the Arctic will be iceless and the waters warmer, everything is threatened (except new migrating-in species), then for any project or human activity that contributes, all bets are off.  A solution would be for Congress to take action, and either allow some activity or shut everything down.\n4. If reason prevails the net effect on projects could be minimal.  But the decision will be in the hands of FWS and NMFS who manage the ESA.  One hopes they and the courts will be reasonable.  But can we agree on reasonable?",

They put the home on the market at the tax appraised value. 3 years and 6 price price reductions later I purchased it for $100,000 less than the muni appraisal. When I appealed, the Appraisal Board agreed to split the difference. I could take that deal or sue the Muni in district court.  While waiting my hearing, a guy in front of me was denied even though he had appraisals from 3 appraisal companies. The Muni tax appraisal is actually based on replacement value their internal computer model generates using square footage, house style and construction, but ignores age, condition and setting; key factors in the value of a property.

This is not an easy to listen to speech. What is important though is that it was 1989, and how little has changed. So for that alone... listen all the way through. Look Sr. Thea Bowman up in wikipedia and find the scope of her efforts though slowly dying.

They told all inmates to pocket them before walking into the admin building.\n\nForget rehabilitation happening, the inmates were lucky if there were enough COs on shift for them to be let outside for yard-time.

In terms of my article, I would like to expand a little on my one sentence: \"Merit-making is tricky business because there is value and disaster in earning my rewards.\"  I emphasized the disasters but there can be rewards as well. We have to be \"awake\" to acknowledge the stirrings of the Spirit within us and around us, and being focused on spiritual practices of various kinds can put us in the spiritual arena.  Perhaps even the \"lower level\", merit-making schemes could keep us engaged long enough to hear the voice of the Spirit calling us to other levels of spiritual awareness and a more mature faith.  I suspect that some people fall asleep spiritually and are not engaged enough to allow themselves to receive new insights.  The problem is remaining at the merit-making beginning of the journey, not the fact that we were once motivated by the merit-making.",

By having the federal government inserting itself into provincial funding simply increases the bureaucracy of both to monitor and report on the spending.\nSecond, provinces are mature forms of government that are responsible to the voting public.

Regarding your Leaf I note that owners seem to be extremely happy with their vehicles at first but after three years a noticeable drop off in range of 30-50% is noted on the various consumer sites I've visited.  From what I can tell it's not the battery that's failing but individual cells within the battery pack itself.  Nissan offers little in the way of a solution except replacement hopefully within the warranty.  Fortunately this problem has become common enough for a new industry to arise which offers a solution namely in the form of a rebuilt salvaged battery.  Sort of like rebuilding your Honda's transmission.  I note that Nissan only guaranteed the battery for 5 years at 70% range.  Perhaps the new model will be better",

The man was, by all accounts, a canny tactician - not a complete idiot.\nSo either the story of the 'traktaat' was made up - or, as was so common in colonial history everywhere, the Boers exploited the language gap to deceive Dingane about what the contract actually said.

Liberals point to a Julius Caesar production in Minneapolis back in 2012 with an Obama reference as a supposed example of how the right didn't care about that portrayal because it was Obama.  Here's where the nuance comes in - that production portrayed \"Obama\" in a sympathetic manner (https://tinyurl.com/y7jyk42a) whereas the current Julius Caesar production is a literal caricature of Donald Trump.  It could be said \"Obama\" was martyred in the 2012 production whereas Trump is drawn, skewered and quartered in the current production.  But why let a little nuance get in the way of good ole liberal outrage.",

Rich slave owners like Lee, and Jefferson and Washington,  found themselves in a situation where their personal feelings about slavery were of little consequence.  More and more often before the war, state and local laws actually forbade freeing one's slaves in one's will, or even freeing them at all, particularly en masse. .",

You have to go to a doctor to get a prescription. Sometimes one doctor has to refer you to another doctor to get the prescription. Example. Why does a woman need a referral (pay for an office visit) to get a mamagram? We need the individual right to treat ourselves in most cases. In local markets like Fairbanks, the one hospital has a monopoly. Certificates of Need. This stupid law was bought and paid for by the local health care providers to guarantee the local monopolies continue. It keeps competition out. The Federal law bought and paid for by big pharma that says you can not buy drugs outside of this country eliminates competition. The fact is many/most hospitals charge up front cash paying customers more than insured patients.  To many insured people provides a guaranteed market & keeps prices high. Care delayed is care denied.",

The purpose is to protect the State if revenue is not available to pay under terms of the contract.  It is not intended to give the State the prerogative to change their mind.

While Trump's words were often careless and frighten me, I found the record of Clinton and Obama to be woeful.  Clinton supported intervention in Iraq, and was hawkish in both Syria and Libya.  For me the worst option is someone willing to intervene when tensions are high but lacks the commitment to stay and fix the problems when public support wanes.  Thus my fear with HRC, was exactly what we had with WJC, a hawish and violent policy, but no long term commitment to states after intervention.  Will Trump be better?  Here I have serious doubts.

You must actually walk the ground at Puys, Dieppe and Pourville to appreciate the difficulties in mounting the raid.  Originally, as OP RUTTER, it was to be supported by massive British naval gunfire support, aerial bombing and paratroops.  OP RUTTER was cancelled as it was not supported by Gen. Montgomery or Adm. Pound. RAF Air Marshal Leigh-Mallory noted that the large stones on the beach would impede the movement of the tanks.  The Canadian Army in the Second World War was not a colonial force subordinate to British Command - the decision to participate was very much a Canadian decision. Much of the blame for the OP JUBILEE raid was the responsibility of the Canadian government and the senior Canadian military leadership - the Army had been in the UK since 1939 and wanted to see some action. Lessons learned at Dieppe were indeed useful for D-Day",

If you were to ONLY look at the two-parent families then yes, a much larger proportion of them are dual income families.  However two-parent families make up a much smaller proportion of all households than they did in the 1970's, so when looking at all households the number of dual-income households hasn't changed much.",

I believe the Spirit has been active inspiring humanity, drawing us to God, from the moment we evolved as homo sapiens and we became immortal. I assert that real organic development is evident throughout the OT and in the NT and down through the history of Christian theology. \n\nIn the past I challenged you on this topic re the early Greek councils of the Church. The trinity and that Jesus is fully God and fully human are fundamentally new understandings beyond the death of the last Apostle. It is true, that have accepted those doctrines, we easily read them back into scripture. What we refuse to acknowledge is that at the time of those early Councils, different theologian read different things in the scriptures. \n\nHere we part ways, and there is no middle ground.",

No, KJU has pushed the envelop to the max and now it is the US turn to push him into the wall.  Comply or die.  We cannot allow NK to  fire at us first and then retaliate. it will be too late then.  In this case we must become the aggressor and strike NK first and with finality.  We cannot afford to dilly-dally on this matter at all.  Let the NKs suffer the massive casualties, instead of us.
