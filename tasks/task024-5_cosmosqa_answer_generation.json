    "Definition": "Workmanship one corrects responding to the matter granted in entry. To make it more interesting, strive to use non-stereotypical parlance if might. Make sure your correct reply is reasonably lang, consonant with the context, and requires common sense (alternatively of explicit extracting from the backdrop.)\nAspects to avoided: -\nConcentration & Prudent: 1. Into your reply, utilize as few phrase as conceivable from the given context.  2. Utilize a response that is rarity/non-stereotypical, so that it is less predictably.  3. Aux be least recur, please vary your vocabulary for each question.",
