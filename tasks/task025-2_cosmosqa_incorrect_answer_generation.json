An interesting fact of Abe Tsuyoshi , he was from China and he can speak both Japanese and Chinese fluently ! I wonder if I were to go to Japan , can I blend in with the Japanese and talk fluent Japanese too ?\nQuestion: What do you know about the speaker ?",
            "output": [
                "The speaker speaks all Asian languages ."
            ]
        }
    ]
