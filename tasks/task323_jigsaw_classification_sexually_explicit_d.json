It's not that they are dealing with overtime, bad roads, rude drivers, & office mismanagement. They are physically under duress, from lots of unwanted exercise (deep snow) & poor quality food (and less of it) so their bodies don't react well to being tranquilized. Moose sometimes die from it. 2nd, it's time-consuming to get to them with trained personnel. May take hours. Someone has to pay for that call as well. And pay for the chopper, fuel, pilot, etc. Weather may ground aircraft from being used. Ground vehicles may not be able to get in to the area. It's not simple or quick. Not even touching the paperwork side. Next, moose can't just be shot and eaten. AF&G has MANY rules on how a moose is 'disposed of' when shot, & most of the time the shooter can't keep it, especially an out-of-season kill.\n\nDon't feed the WILD animals & give them space.

It is a good thing fans don't run a program but in the end, they have the final say.\n\nMy opinion, give H the chance to turn this season around, give Hoke a chance to build a defense around his scheme before the program is really screwed up because of emotionalism. Oregon's lack of defense for the past 2+ years has been the real issue. Its offense has been better than good every year. We will know if Helfrich is a good to great coach at the end of the season.

As far is being \"ready\" now that Trump is President, I doubt anyone thought Trump would win the election (except Trump).  Congress isn't going to work on a plan for the fun of it. So, they will come up with a plan. Sen. Paul's plan makes total sense. Dr. Price has good ideas as well. Don't underestimate Trump's ability to manage a group of people, even a complex topic like healthcare.  If I'm wrong I'll be surprised but the first to admit it. Noheawilli has listed a few excellent points below, and that's just a start.  Also, Senator Schumer's warnings about repealing the ACA are very disingenuous; the law conveniently doesn't apply to him and his family.  He's trying to scare the public.

Some of the side effects of most antidepressants have is worsening condition, or how about increased suicidal thoughts, increased nervelessness and anxiety. Marijuana is more likely to mellow you out and give you the munchies and reduce anxiety than anything else.

That good scholarship requires being open to challenge doesn't imply that any challenge is relevant to good scholarship. That is just bad logic and falsely implies that we (as academics and interested citizens) are not allowed to distinguish between cranks and legitimate criticism.\n\n2. The piece is framed in relation to race, implying resistance to Rau may have been race-related. Is the author unaware that black mathematicians advised taking down Rau's piece for The Conversation?\n\n3. Finally, author uses his ignorance about mathematics as a basis for endorsing Rau's invitation. It is not clear to me why the author's ignorance should be of concern to the rest of us.\n\nThe result is a poor attempt at pseudo-radicalism, that may indirectly discredit legitimate calls for decolonisation.

Stalin was Georgian, not Russian, and thus lacked the chauvinistic attitude of most Russian soviet leaders towards non-Russians. Therefore, he had those then internal borders drawn reasonably strictly upon the basis of ethnic boundaries. With the exception of Crimea (a very complex ethnic and linguistic area) and a few other places, the internal borders of the former soviet union are ethnic and linguistic boundaries.\n\nAmazingly, most media correctly describe this phenomenon by always referring to the area as Russian speaking rather than as Russian.",

Hofer and titled ,\"Supreme Court Reversal Rates: Evaluating the Federal Courts of Appeals\".                          If anyone chose to read the Court's decision regarding the President's Executive order, they would be, or more accurately, should be stunned to notice that the laws supporting the President's temporary ban were neither cited or considered by the Court. Unusual or incompetent, political or foolish, you decide. My decision, as is the same with most Americans, is that when courts do not base decisions on actual, printed, legal, on the books laws, justice is denied. John Kawamoto clearly favors courts not referring to laws or even addressing the law and he has that right. SCOTUS,  contrary to John's belief, would consider the law.",

As Meleana said, \"boy talk\" from a presidential candidate. \nYou second assertion that we assume Christians agree with everything a politician does is not correct. We know Christians are generally not single issue voters, but many ARE Right to Life Voters. When Trump said a woman who gets an abortion must be punished, he got the Right to Life vote. \nAnd no, they should not have voted for Hillary either. All I would ask is that they admit they are not so pious as they profess (but then deny because they are \"humble before God).\nTrump is a narcissist who even complained that he got Person of the Year instead of Man of the Year.

Not hard to believe, since it seems to be almost impossible post-secondary as well. Many students leave high school having spent very little time in the courses where these questions are examined with any sophistication because it isn’t required within the 30 credit system. One required history course, one required social science course (of which economics is one of the choices). The history of Canada becomes a story of oppression, psychology and sociology become studies of racism/sexism/phobias of many kinds.

As I see it, we have trivialized sexual assault to mean anything a woman does not like.  Rarely is sexual intercourse the issue.  No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.

Anyone who's seen Desmond make a throw from the OF is going to have no such reservations, as it's often hard to tell which base he's throwing to.

Far from being a vice, wanting that for others is a great virtue.  My belief in the subject, however, is that regardless of what we think God is saying to us, the definitive manner in which He speaks in the world today is through His Church.  Only on that authority do we have any knowledge of God in Scripture, or in our lives.  That said, I will concede that too many on both \"right\" and \"left\" do not know that there exists both an infallible and fallible magisterium.  The former we accede to from faith, the second from obedience to authority if good conscience does not dictate otherwise.  That's a new discussion, however.\nThanks, again.",

I would pick a resort in a built up area with many other resorts around.   I definitely would not travel from August to December.

Water expands too. Put a glass measuring cup of water on a stove and heat it up. The water level will rise within the measuring cup. If you heat 500ml of water from 20 to 80 degrees C, the water level will rise about 6ml on the scale printed on the measuring cup. You can do this experiment and see with your own two eyes that water levels rise when heated. DO YOU DENY YOUR OWN TWO EYES? Okay, so global warming will only heat the oceans 1 or 2 degrees, but the average ocean depth is over 12,000 feet deep. A rise in water level of 1 foot in a 12,000 foot deep ocean is much smaller than a rise of 6ml in a 500ml cup, and only takes a couple degree change in ocean temperature.",

What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

I rebuffed him, and he was a gentleman about it. I was really annoyed, but I continued to work at that job for a while. Was it an abuse of power? Yes. Was it a crime? Actually, legally it may have been. But I don't think of it as a crime. Women used to experience this kind of stuff all the time. I'd like to think the culture has changed a bit since then.\n\nUnfortunately, as you may remember, I have also been a rape victim. So I give women who claim they've been raped the benefit of the doubt. But...at times, it's not the truth.",

The early man was as progressive (in our terms) as they come; the later man was definitely interested in turning back the clock, but back to 1960 not 1860. Neither Ratzinger was an anti-Modernist as defined by the magisterium. \n\nAs for scripture, I would suggest that Ratzinger's acceptance of modern scriptural scholarship as a method was complete, and this is perhaps a prime data point for establishing that he was not anti-Modernism.",

I don't know if Diarmuid Martin doesn't see a need for change or he is stymied at getting any cooperation from other bishops.\n\nColeridge is at least talking about some of the kinds of structural change that are needed - more lay people and women participating in governance.  He talks about the problems of the prima donna clerics rather than those who really serve.  He has some of the right words and there is at least one other bishop who is more open to change than he is.  I have a hard time imagining other Aussie bishops going along - but Coleridge is saying some of the right things.  Dare I hope?",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

Story's strikeout rate makes him a large hole in the lineup (defensive specialist). Cargo has played great defense yet he has been another hole in the lineup. Not sure why catchers allowing so many wild pitches. After a great early start, the pitchers have struggled basic bunts and Ottivino/Dunn prove there is no setup man costing several game.

Virgil Green has been predicted to have \"a breakout year\" for the last 3 years. 57 catches over 6 seasons? It's fair to say he hasn't worked out. Heuerman still has a chance to be good, but needs to stay healthy. He started to play well in the last 3 games of the 2016 season, so hopefully he can build on that. Jake Butt has promise, however he's recovering from injury and isn't a proven NFL talent yet. Elway is playing with fire if he doesn't sign FA TE Gary Barnidge. Barnidge proved his worth when putting up good stats with the Cleveland QB carousel. With 2 young QBs and all the uncertainty at TE, a 2 year deal would be a wise move. That way if Heuermann or Butt breakthrough this season, Barnidge can be traded or cut.",

We're not in danger of the house of Obama taking over because of popular opinion. If that were possible, the buffoon currently in office would have already been overthrown and replaced. This gripe is petty and hardly worth utterance in the sort of backwood, uneducated circles where such an obvious tantrum-like complaint might receive cheers, let alone the national conversation.

I'll have to stop saying that to  my Alberta friends and relatives, and stick to the sales tax.\nBut as far as the resource revenue, that is neither here nor there.  The 50% factor means that effectively half of the resource revenue is deducted from the equalization amount.    One could argue that 100% should be deducted not just 50%.  But aside from that, Albertans conveniently forget their resource revenue when they whine (and boy do they whine) about equalization payments.  The other thing many of them don't realize is that the government of Alberta doesn't pay one cent to the other provinces under the formula.  It's a distribution based on federal taxes collected from all citizens.  In that sense we all pay into the kitty regardless of province.  And Alberta gets nothing back because of their resource revenue.\nI don't buy the Quebec/N.B. argument either.  Alberta can leave theirs in the ground too.  It's their choice.",

I also find the \"Four Hymn\" framework tiresome.  The Roman Missal, if followed properly, has an entrance antiphon, communion antiphon, sung Gloria, Psalm, Eucharistic Antiphons...quite a bit of sung prayer in the Mass, if it were simply celebrated properly.  And, the idea that every spare second of the Mass just has to be filled up with music is ridiculous - sacred silence is nearly nonexistent in our liturgies now, yet God speaks, most often, in the silence, and in our day and age, silence is something most people never experience, yet at the same time, desperately need.",

They don't just get to say \"I sinned, please forgive me\" and be welcomed back into the fold.\n\nThere are two more, slightly less important but still key, differences:\n1) This is rarer on the left - it is just a fact. Just in the last 20 years well over a hundred GOP elected officials have been caught committing sex crimes. Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing. Nobody is pretending there is less sex on the left -but leftists don't try to legislate anything beyond 'consensual adults'. There's no hypocrisy in being gay or divorced on the left. There damn well is if you claim to support 'family values'.",

There are even more women who will use sexual abuse allegations as a means to get bigger settlements in divorce and child custody cases. Some times it is just plain blackmail and extortion. There is real sexual abuse and it happens way too much but sometimes there is also another side to the story and that should be tracked too. If feminists don't like it, tough.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

No, this is normative developmental and universal sexual behavior.  And by universal I that means that it is practiced by all human beings at one time or another in their lives.  And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

My High School would be on par with some of the private schools here in Hawaii. When in grade school, there were always field trips to the planetarium, it wasn't till I was in the seven grade and in sports and went to other schools that I learned that they didn't have what our school had, you get what you pay for. The people in Hawaii have been getting, and this is just my opinion, sub par education in the public school system here for a long time.

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

If you have a sizable RRSP which when converted to a RRIF will force minimum payments at a higher taxable rate, would it be advantageous to delay CPP/OAS until 70 and live solely on RRSP withdrawals from 65 to 70.  That way there will be less going into the RIFF and the minimum withdrawals will be lower.  Is this a beneficial strategy or will the higher CPP/OAS at 70 counteract the reduced minimum?\nSay you have $900K in RRSPs + 100K in non-registered at age 65 when you retire.  How would you minimize the income tax paid over the next 25 years (keeping below the 45k bracket)?\n65 - 70: RRSP withdrawal only at 55K/year plus 20K from non-registered\n70 - 71: CPP/OAS 25K + 35 K RRSP plus 15K from non-registered\nThis would leave 700K (assuming low growth ) for RRIF conversion\n71 - 99: CPP/OAS plus RRIF minimum",

However sometimes the camps will refuse to compromise and will not allow for any flexibility thus disrupting the cooperative humanistic process inside Trudeau's mind. That is when Mr. Trudeau gets confused and in that moment, if he is at a press conference or at a town-hall meeting he makes mistakes and says things that don't make sense.

The country was just damned tired of seeing body bags and footage of Viet Nam on evening news programs and wanted to move on. I think what afflicted most veterans of that war was the sense of being simply ignored. No one wanted to hear the war stories about death and destruction when we returned. We were ignored rather than given homecoming celebrations and that hurt a lot of veterans more than the carnage of the actual war. I enlisted under the influence of John Birch lies. It took going to that god forsaken country to understand those lies. No more wars launched on lies",

Something will bite Trump in the ass and result in something hurting the US on an international level, and result in fallout on the international level. Take your pick what this is? NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

Prince Kuhio wanted 1/32. 50% was the compromise. \n\nYet, until this day, many try to use the issue of blood quantum to keep our Lahui divided, when as one Lahui we are not. The article itself takes no issue with blood quantum.\n\nI mentioned the Danner clans lack of sufficient blood quantum only to underscore the subversive treachery that these American-Hawaiians would resort to to continue their policy to federalize the vast majority of Kanaka who overwhelmingly said `A`OLE to FedWreck!\n\nTheir treachery included falsifying their blood quantum to give themselves legitimacy & grab homestead which is illegal!",

Many felt she stabbed him in the back after he saved her paper .  One issue showcased the difference between the Times and News. The Times refused to accept advertising money from business's that were considered  fronts for prostitution . The News knowingly accepted they're money , showcasing how money trumped what was best for the community. For those wanted to know about Anchorage's past , the book Atwood's Alaska is a great read.",

Translated, that means that Fed scoring on the 3rd route would be lowered so LTD would be less likely to get funding. Scrape below the surface, and you can see how screwed up this is: Get more funding by spending a lot more money for additional infrastructure to provide EmX service to an additional neighborhood area that is hell-bent against EmX running down W. 11th and 13th Aves.\n\nThankfully, JWN members organized early and insisted in a refinement plan update before any decision to run EmX through the neighborhood.",

That comment you made is blaming her for being drunk.

Oh well like she said about her husband abusing women, it's all in the past!\nThe Clintons have such wonderful values, just like Hollywood that supports them and other Democratic Party members.

Diacetyl is that \"buttery\" smell of microwave popcorn and causes \"popcorn lung\", irreversible lung damage.

About the most important power the federal government has is to provide a military to protect our nation.

It can only exist until the voters discover they can vote themselves largess of the public treasury. From that moment on the majority votes for the candidate promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy...\" Prof. Alexander Fraser Tyler, writing when the states were STILL colonies of Great Britain.  Her \"wish list\" is aptly explained with that quote.  B. Franklin stated, \"...I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it.\"",

Only humorists can capture the ludicrousness of this ignorant cretin being POTUS elect:\n\n\"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—An alarming report issued by heads of the U.S. intelligence agencies on Friday asserts that the Twitter account of President-elect Donald Trump was successfully hacked by a four-year-old child.\n\nProfilers and cryptologists who studied Trump’s Twitter feed believe that the account was first hacked during the 2016 campaign, when the child was three.\n\n“The hacker would often wake up in the middle of the night, in an addled and cranky state, and start tweeting,” an intelligence source said. “This disrupted sleep pattern is consistent with a suspect in the three-to-four-year-old age range.”\n\nN.S.A. analysts who studied the vocabulary, syntax, and spelling of the tweets “determined beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are the work of a preschooler,” the source said.\"",

Imposing his will is what he does best, in fact -- just look at the Deplorables who head gov't agencies and influence policy daily.  \n\nI'm not convinced the Dem Party is down and out.  It seems to me that some of them, along with the ACLU and a smattering of Repubs with integrity, are all that is keeping the US from chaos and multi-pronged disaster.  Dems absolutely DO need a strong, charismatic, qualified, experienced leader and I haven't seen a sign of one yet.  Hillary has (wisely) insisted she will not be a candidate again and maybe an impending housecleaning will finally silence her influence.  Dems seem to be at least united against DJT - yea!",

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

Congress freed the slaves in the District in 1862, compensating their owners. The Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves in the states that had seceded, went into effect on Jan. 1, 1863. But Maryland didn’t act until 1864, when it held a referendum\"  \"Maryland luminary, Montgomery Blair, President Abraham Lincoln’s postmaster general, was more concerned about punishing secessionists and preserving the Union than advancing freedom for African Americans.\"\n\nThis is TRUE history not the pablum renaming buildings will foster in the name of political correctness",

Playing hard like you're untouchable and not phased by abuse, not even a fly landing on your face is not the kind of cold person, I assume would be fit to combat abuse. She didn't even try to run away from the fly, she ignored it as it landed on her face. Standby your man even when he cheats on you publically is played out.

However the depth of evidence that he supplies for declining union strength, self-employment, the growth of part-time employment and so forth, also pretty much undermines the traditional arguments for a target inflation rate of 2% or higher based on wage stickiness. Unfortunately he doesn’t seem to notice. If Haldane were asked about it he would probably retreat behind  the excuse that it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer and not the Bank of England who decides on the remit of the central bank, including what the target rate of inflation should be.",

The pings do not conclusively show what kind of communication existed between the servers, only that, in Internet parlance, they were trying to \"find\" one another's IP addresses on numerous occasions.\n\nThe Trump server had other anomalies. When researchers tried to ping it themselves, they received an error message, implying the server was set to reject incoming requests except for those from pre-approved IP addresses, creating a sort of private hotline between the Trump server and Alfa Bank, which accounted for 87 percent of the overall traffic the server experienced.\n\nThe leaders of Alfa Bank have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"",

The political parties mostly exist to serve their own needs to gather votes and money rather than the public interest despite their claims to the contrary.",

However, suddenly in 2015 Thomas Karl then director of the NOAA came up with a set of data that \"proved\" that the hiatus actually never occurred. This was just before the Paris climate conference. I do not have the time to attempt to get to the real truth, but it seems that they managed to prove that the temperature increase did not slow down, by recalculating the temperature increase that occurred before the \"slowdown\". In other words, the average temperature increase during the \"hiatus\" remained what it was, but the average temperature increase for the preceding 50 years was recalculated down, i.e. when the data did not suit their model, they \"recalculated\" the data, not the other way round. Sounds fishy?",

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class.

When pushed an almost automatic push back. That may explain the attitude and resentment at the dinner table...the sense of having been invaded by illegal outsiders, schools having to hire spanish speaking teachers, hospital emergency rooms turning into outpatient clinics to treat their medical needs, etc., a major cost to the taxpayer for people who are not citizens who are here illegally. An invasion  that happened quickly over a period of roughly 10 years. And now we had a candidate who wanted to clean up this mess and all OR  voters except for PDX and Eugene said yes!",

Such a judgmental statement is in ignorance of how anyone and everyone chooses to marry: it is out of love, and one way that love is expressed is through the intimacy of sexual union.  Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.  We've heard it all before, and it still makes little sense, just like celibacy and creeping infallibility.",

Hitler finally committed suicide when the Red Army invaded Berlin in 1945, aided by the Allies.\nIt is the KKK in this country that detests Catholics as much as African-Americans and Jews.  That is why symbols, flags, monuments, and tributes to the Confederacy are loved by the \"Imperial Wizards\".\nThe KKK, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, white supremacists (euphemistically called the alt-right) all base their doctrine of hate and bigotry on the premise of racial purity and superiority.\nSadly, these groups seem to be getting more popular in America lately.",

So adding another 600 to the mix makes sense?...,Not!  The proposed 600 would be in the general area of campus and if they were in place today that would bring the campus apartment vacancy range to approximately 800. And these numbers represent the higher range of rentals since the university is still in session.\n\n The 224 or so campus vacancies will likely double or triple during the summer months. In case the landowner has a way to write off a loss...it seems there is not the demand for another 600 rental apartments to serve the campus area, when the general area currently has 644 vacancies and campus has 224. Proposing an additional 600 near campus is a head scratcher for sure.",

Other criminal systems do not take that approach - such as in China where the conviction rate is something like 98% and trials are basically a foregone conclusion heavily stacked in the prosecution's favour - the philosophy there is to maximize convictions at the expense of locking up many innocent people in the process. It is very much a legal expression of a more collectivist culture and political philosophy. \n\nIn Canada, individualism and individual rights against government power come first, so the system heavily favours the accused, both with the presumption of innocence, and the fact that the entire burden of proof rests on the Crown (i.e. the accused doesn't have to prove his innocence in court because he is already considered innocent and it is entirely on the Crown to bring the case for guilt).",

More important is the fact that before the Irish Sin Books were introduced, fewer things were considered mortal sin. Indeed, the concept of going to confession for them and saying a few prayers to have them removed was a development, as was the fetishization of being in a state of grace for Communion. That does not happen now either and it is a welcome change. No fetish is healthy. In a few decades, no one will remember the Church of the Holy Fetish.",

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to.

This. however, creates additional CO2 emissions, has a significant cost impact, and does little to reduce the most harmful sub 5 micron particulate emissions. \n\nThe technology is relatively new and is installed on only small part of the commercial fleet. As it matures, additional PM, NOx and CO2 reductions will be possible. \n\nAs for the 1000's of cars emissions comparison - this is a misleading statement at best.

Participation in this project was voluntary and analytical results were provided to participating schools. The data collected in this project will be used for national research and risk assessments of these chemicals to specifically address the drinking water component for children during their developmental years.

Staff anywhere were tourists are expected to have contact with locals are white. The whites also live in the best houses. People beg not for money but food, soap, clothes and tooth paste. Speaking of money, there is one currency for tourists and the rich and one for the poor, guess which one actually has value to  buy necessities or travel.\n\nCuba, may have a few positives, but those don't outweigh its failures, brutality and segregation.\n\nOn the plus side I am glad to see so many posters calling you out.",

In a nutshell:\n\nIf there was something called \"freedom of speech\" entrenched in the US constitution, it was because the VALUE of free speech was deemed essential to a democracy, and that concept spread to other western democracies, thanks to \"the Left\" which led the battle against censorship of movies, books, art, etc., unions which fought for the right of employees not to be fired for their political opinions, etc. \n\nIt wasn't long ago that Free Speech was a basic value of the Left, and they argued for it with all the familiar arguments, \"the answer to speech you disagree with is more speech, not censorship\", etc.\n\nThose are the same arguments used by \"the Press\" in favor of ITS \"freedom of the press\".\n\nIf one believes in those argument against censorship by governments, why would one not believe in them against censorship BY the press, of comments by its readers?

HIS choice and HIS dream, and I support him. \nI've met all the boys in his class and for the most part, they are not \"girlish\" at all. Just like any other class or group of kids, they lie somewhere on a spectrum.\nI guess I shouldn't automatically take this as a slight on the ballet world, but you madam, are feeding into the stereotype of male ballet dancers being effeminate or \"girlish\". I think his classmates as well as male dancers in general may take offence. \nPS. Your boy will be forced to learn to deal with bullies if he keeps dancing. Is bullying boyish or girlish?",

The \"pleasures of anal sex\"... what?!?  When i was a young man there were three primary STD's - now there are over 2 dozen of which girls suffer the most from this promotion of sexual activity. Approximately 30% of the girls in the Toronto GTA suffer from some form of STD - yes that is correct! Many of which are now robbed of the ability to have children. But they don't teach that! \n\nSex, sex, sex, sex and more sex\nEnough is enough!",
