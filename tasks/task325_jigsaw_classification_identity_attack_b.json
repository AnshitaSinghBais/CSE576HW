In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

The West role is protection, not intervention. But of course this is quite idealistic, refuted by 2300 years of history. The West always intervene into non-White cultures and territory. Because they think they are superior. \n\nObama the black imperialist will be gone soon. The question is will his replacement conduct the same kind of policy. The U.S. 7th Fleet is itching for a war with China. Mess up SE Asia like Middle East. Trump is itching for a war on Iran, make Israel happy. See war is how the West believe they can fix their economies.",

Call out the alt-left on their violence when defending something actually defensible.    These douche bag white supremacists hurt right of centre and conservatives.",

On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the \"white slave trade\".

You didn't see whites hit the streets stealing and burning after Reginal Denny was pulled out of his truck by blacks . Nor did they riot or protest when O.J. was found innocent . Blacks celebrated someone getting away with murder .   Where are Black Lives Matters leaders this weekend as blacks slaughter more blacks in Chicago ?  Where's the march over that ?

This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

They have been in most of Pat's era. Bobby was a great judge of talent for a period of time, but what Bowlen did with TV expansion and the multi-headed monster of juggling today's rosters (and player's union demands like roughly one practice a week in pads) put him in a different category.

The thesis to my understanding is that humans are making modifications to the environment and are adversely impacting the environment. There many variables, some not well understood, but it is known that we have been pumping CO2 into the atmosphere and CO2 absorbs infrared and reemits about half it absorbs back at the earth that should have gone to space. You might think, Co2 has been higher in the past, but natural forces caused then pulled that CO2 out of the atmosphere and at longer timescales. We can hope the earth will correct itself, after all it is constantly balancing itself, but we cannot stick our heads in the sand and believe we are not the cause if the new balance causes dramatic changes to how we survive.",

Perhaps the consultants who are currently working for the legislature will shed more light on the problem.    \n\nIt would be interesting to see a table that shows an annual per barrel breakdown of the value of the oil, and then the various deductions from that barrel for royalty, taxes, shipping costs, etc. for that oil since it began being shipped from the slope.

I found that Diclectin reduced the nausea and vomiting but did not eliminate them. Once on Diclectin, I was vomiting only once or twice a day and the nausea was somewhat more intermittent than it had been. Not an easy spit-up, mind you, but full gut-wrenching vomiting. But that was a massive improvement over all day, and it helped me keep down enough calories to curb the weight loss and start putting on weight.

The Southern economy was premised on slavery and the leaders perceived, probably correctly, that the end of slavery would cause a tremendous upheavel in Southern life...both culturally and economically.  Those leaders also perceived (again, likely very correctly) that, with the election fo Abraham Lincoln and the ever-growing power of the Abolitionist movement, slavery in the U.S. was coming to an end....and likely in the near future.  Rather than seek to negotiate as favorable a transition as possible, likely including compensation for emancipated slaves, the South chose to secede.  It's no surprise that most the young men in the South chose to support secession. They were raised in the South and slavery was part of the values system of their lives.  ....and, yes, those damn Yankees were going to end slavery.  Gary Crum",

We found an interesting phenomenon occurring amongst inmates about to be sentenced.  If they were to be sentenced to 9 months or more in the county jail, or 1 or more years in prison, almost all were opting for the longer prison terms over the county jail term.  They thought the prison term had many more freedoms and benefits available to it and chose that option over the shorter but more restrictive county jail sentence.  Clearly, we are doing something wrong with our prisons when inmates would rather serve time there rather than in the county jail.  What I believe we need to do is go back to making prisons real places of punishment.  How did 'benefits' EVER come into play with prison life - UNREAL!",

The Senate majority then wants to raid the Permanent Fund to subsidize the theft of our oil.",

Comey confirmed that the FBI is investigating possible links and coordination between Russia and Trump associates and acknowledged the existence of a counterintelligence investigation into the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, and said the probe extends to the nature of any links between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government.  Electronic surveillance, which includes wiretapping, is commonly used in such investigations and most likely was used or is being used in the investigations.    Warrants would have been required.

And as happens with property it changed hands, through buying and selling. The Republic kept property rights in place. And those remained in place after annexation. Giving us a singular historical characteristic, large landowners control most of the land in Hawaii, except where it has been broken down through fee simple housing sales. An example is the Cambell Estate on the West Side, Princess Kahanakoa is an heiress to that estate. Her property rights remained in force through all the changes in government. The actual issue in all these suits and foreclosures are these poperty rights. Claiments lose everytime, their property foreclosed, because of a false legal theory. The overthrow and annexation was a change in political regimes. Not some social revolution that took the land. The result of this theory Hawaiians are losing their land.",

Study the Republican administrations of the 1920s, for example -- as well as earlier -- and you'll find no (or very little) support for your assertions that Republicans believed that government needs to be large enough to ensure every citizen has a decent standard of living. They had other reasons for favoring a strong central government, but they had very little (if any) concern for the livelihoods of ordinary citizens. William Leuchtenberg's new (huge!) volume titled The American Presidency: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton will give you a good overview, if you're interested.

Unfortunately for Pence, the portrait of Trump he presented bore no resemblance to the actual Trump, and for anyone who values truth in this election (which, as in war, seems to be the first casualty) that's a problem. Time will tell, but as Steve Schmidt said yesterday, this was probably the least consequential VP debate in a generation since all the interest is being generated at the top of the ticket, specifically with Donald Trump's daily antics.",

I like to think of it as after paying taxes for decades for all the things government does , the government is giving me a little money back, taxable of course. Before you pay tax on it , you get a little over $500. So in a rough calculation, moving the age of OAS from 65 to 67 means that you are short $12K for retirement from that revenue stream. If $12K or $6K determines what year you can retire, then it would seem that you are hardly financially sound, and would be wise to work a little longer.",

There should be a whole lot of soul-searching going on among the more intelligent people on the right, but I've heard very little of that, only about the need for liberals to reach out and try to understand the poor suffering people who voted for Trump. I understand all I need to about such people, especially the part about how Trump voters were, on average, richer than Hillary voters, so spare me the lecture about economics.

Chinatown today requires a clean up of the derelicts, especially at night and the trash that the local food businesses leave on sidewalks after closing each day.

And that George W Bush in his last months removed all obstacles to sharing of information, including that on Americans, between the NSA and 15 other government agencies. And that the information with unmasked identities was then widely distributed and leaked to the media. \n\nRegardless of ideology or party, that would have been a huge problem and a huge scandal.

He'd have to get physical and psychological clearance before being permitted to operate the tiny, loud, slow-moving Cessna his single engine land license allowed for. Moreover, The Mandalay Bay is very close to McCarran and thus is in restricted and heavily policed airspace. He'd have to file a flight plan and seek permission well in advance to even get close to the concert. Could he have done it? Possibly. Could he have caused anywhere near the death and terror with a Cessna? Probably not. Point is, with a plane instead of guns his terror plan would have been way harder, way less likely to succeed and would not have caused nearly the same amount of carnage. The VT was a cold calculating evil doer. He picked what he knew was the most effective plan-the one with the path of least administrative resistance, the least anti-crazy red tape and the highest possible death toll: modified assault rifles.",

The groundwork for a lawsuit to establish the ruling you and I would like to see the Court make has already been laid down, sure. But until someone actually brings a case dealing with this issue before the bench, and the court makes a ruling on this issue, specifically, the law hasn’t changed.

While symbolically it would be great to see the embassy moved, IF I were the US President, I would not do it.  There are so many other ways ( which the us does) to support Israel, and they should continue to do those endeavours.

Making them illegal helps no one, but most certainly hurts those who need them to function.\nDoctors seem to believe it is \"ethical\" to allow people to suffer rather than prescribing opiates. This misguided morality created the black market that has resulted in the current crisis. Very reminiscent of prohibition, and we figured that one out eventually. Hopefully given that opiates are a whole lot more useful for everything from pain to coughing than alcohol ever was, we will eventually get off the high horse and make some sensible recommendations to keep people comfortable.",

Looking at the city's other Alternative newspaper, for one example, it still seems like there is incessant, internecine bickering going on between backers of the two major Democratic candidates.

In my opinion, if the removal of statues is not accompanied by a systemic effort to uproot racist ideas and attitudes, we won't have accomplished anything. So perhaps the removals should come at the end of a process, as a sort of culmination of a national effort to excise a cancer, and their presence till then should serve as a reminder of what remains to be done.\nWill our bishops take the lead in bringing an end to racism?

Obamacare \"covered\" about \"27 million\" by expanding Medicaid to pay cover them and raised taxes to pay for this additional cost of around $10 billion.  However, when organized labor (like the ILWU) found out that Obamacare was going to impose a \"Cadillac Tax\" on their generous union healthcare benefits starting at 40%, the proverbial kukai hit the fan.  So now, the taxes are not being collected to pay for Obamacare and only the Federal deficit is getting bigger.  So what is the solution?

Many resent refugees receiving advantages that they (or some poor Canadians) don't receive while unable to contribute economically for years. However, the target of complaints represents a dwindling number, and less than 16% of annual migrants by 2020.",

Their grandmother was the first black female to be promoted to captain within the department back in the early ninties.

What the citizens of Denver and Colorado should be asking is how can blacks hold so many key positions within the local government when blacks make up roughly one fifth of Denver's population.

No serious baseball fan thought that Bautista would return to career high stats. We knew that Travis was questionable. Tulowitzki was fragile. And left field was practically vacant going into the season. You couldn't seriously believe that the starting rotation would repeat their success from 2016. Stroman continues to be marketed as an ace pitcher, but still behaves like a child on the mound. That's not to say that he lacks talent or ambition. He clearly has both.

Were you not aware of the truck following too closely ever since you poked your way through Pleasant Hill? Were you determined to teach him or her a lesson? Did it occur to you that pulling over to let the truck pass, since you'd left 10 minutes early anyway, was the right thing to do under the circumstances? Do you also let vehicles stack up 12 deep behind you on HIghway 101, just because you can?\n\nThe trucker was wrong, of course.

So I am attracted by Stephen Jay Gould's tow magistera, where neither can invade the space of the other, but the excesses of both can be eliminated. The paradigm shift, as you mention, is indeed immense, since the churches tend to accept not only the heart of the gospel message but the cultural skin which encloses it in now archaic categories. \nEvolution should not be a problem for RC people.

Once leftists got power, Petronas did the smart thing to avoid wasting anymore time or money.  BC is going to be an economic basket case with smart investment money fleeing the province.\nSanford then goes on to cite Australia. As an \"economist\" Sanford should know that resource projects get built through boom and bust cycles - Always.   Sometimes they lose money in \"bust\" years -  but they are built for the long term.\nFunny how Sanford didn't mention the South Australian power crisis.  That portion of the country tried \"green power\" alternatives and is now under threat of being left in the dark on a regular basis.

If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. This thing of always looking to blame others for our inadequacies makes me sick. We've got the NDP which the ANC government painstakingly prepared to guide the way forward. What's this nonsense of radical economic transformation? I'm sick and tired of people who are utter failures and always seeking to blame others. Other countries that had previously been colonised have done a lot for themselves - South Korea, Indonesia, etc. For how long are we going to carry on blaming others and not getting our hands and brains busy building this country?

The freedom of not having to be perfect has energized my spiritual life and love for God in a way that perfection never could have.  I now understand St. Paul when he says \"the letter of the law kills, but the spirit gives life.\"  I think (I am riffing on Richard Rohr here) that strict, rule based, merit based religion is a necessary stage of growth on the way to spiritual adulthood.

Between now and then I'm sure Putin's army of hackers is hard at work to ensure a Le Pen victory next month. Given their success here, I suspect that it will be much easier for them to influence a much smaller country like France. As Fareed Zakaria pointed out in his show yesterday, authoritarianism is gaining ground all over the world. If France rejects the fear and bigotry that Le Pen represents that will indeed be a great upset victory for the forces of Light. But it's not over until the fat lady sings, and at this point she hasn't even warmed up yet. Let us pray that the forces of Darkness do not prevail this time.

Many publicly held companies will protect their shareholder dividends, or the share price, by raising their consumer price.   The other favored protection for shareholder return, is withholding wages and benefits from their employee's.

The tribes, generally, don't have a lot of money, and the corporations, which do have money,  are not tribes and will not be funding tribal governmental functions.  Any governmental function taken over by the tribes will still be funded by the State or Federal government.  I'm not sure how to state my point any more simply or clearly.  Regarding ANTHC, the consortium does far more than provide hospitals and medical clinics. They administer many other health and environmental related functions, like sewer and water systems.

The net benefit was to allow the handful of trucks with GVW over 40 tons to continue using that route, which provides almost no benefit to anyone other than a handful of trucking firms (who have successfully lobbied to keep Oregon as one of the few states that allow commercial trucks over 40 tons).",

If you want that kind of service you will need closer to the lower 48 large population centers. We're lucky to have what we have. And if your getting 1 gbps/1 TB -- that's pretty darn good given where you are.",

About 16,000 people were murdered in the U.S. last year and I dare say that the perps were mostly people who never served one day in a military service.  Who do you blame for that?",
