Because of this new forum, several of my comments, which weren't horrible, get banned due to the thin skinned sensibility of some of the people that use this.\n\nNo conversation can be pure when people are disallowed from speaking freely, regardless of how unfounded or vitriolic. \n\nBut in regards to the news today; whether Muslim or white bread American, young men in this country are extremely susceptible to this type of behavior. Frustration with no clue how to deal with it.",

Look at some of the Evangelicals who would kill homosexuals for their own good.   Tell me a difference.   Why not choose to interpret it as intended to help humankind",

Solid accounts by rare seminary or chancery personnel underline this reality. Yes, concupiscence is a function of humanity, so let's start such conversations by being compassionate and, where required, forgiving. But we must also acknowledge that the sideways living of enough priests, and the bishops who manage them and who themselves live less than integrated lives, give cover to those in their ranks who engage in criminal, and not merely immoral, behavior.

My take-away is that any systematic attempt to understand homosexuality as carrying any gifts or positive connotations is distasteful to Ruse, even when the proponents of such views embrace celibacy, and understand all licit sexual activity to be ordered towards procreation, within marriage, between a man and a woman.  My favorite part is when he says, \"We wonder how someone's sexual or affectional desires are in any way our business. Yet they are made to be our business.\" His use of \"we\" is so charming. I, also, wonder why it is  his business,  and  question the use of passive voice. \"Made to be our business.\" Indeed. Back in the closet with you all.",

Mohammed their prophet was a pedophile and a mass murder. Islam does not fit my definition of religion. Does your religion ordered you to kill or enslave people not of your religion?

This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Islam in North America is called the \"Religion of Peace\" but their Mid East roots do not support this assumption. Islam is a Political entity that must rule not just be a Religion as we see everywhere it dominates as in many African and all Mid Eastern Countries. These Countries have blasphemy laws protecting only Islam, WHY?? They are expecting those same laws of protection as we see now being put forward by Islamic people in our political system. Once in power force becomes their means of making sure they remain in power. Research yourself, Islams god IS NOT the same God of Christians and Jews as they say.

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true. So I just want to apologize let u know that I understand now.I am sorry that you have to still encountr ignorance",

Being misandristic and racist is the meme of the day for millennials of color in today's liberal media. King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families. Perhaps these two need a dose of reality, that all people have difficulties in life, that there are two choices, 1) to be angry and blame others or 2) rise up from emotionalism rhetoric and become a leader.",

There are Muslim countries like Turkey (which nightclub do you want to celebrate New Year's Eve in?).  I think Islam is a blight.

This means that the lay people were the voice of the Church and it was their common sense that determined the horizontal structures of the Church. The head of the Church was Jesus, not the pope, and that made all the difference. What are we doing honoring a human being as the head of the Church, especially when popes are ignoring the commands of Jesus and worshiping an institution instead? It has been many years since I have heard a bishop talk about living the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. All we hear are bishops interfering in the sexual lives of the lay people. Very sad.",

There was nothing \"uncivil\" about his post.  All it was was apparently unpopular.",

Sharia is nothing more, nor less, than a principle that a religious Muslim will follow the commandments of the Quran. It has nothing to do with civil law whatsoever. There are an almost infinite number of variant interpretations of Sharia, just as there are an infinite number of variations on what a Jew must do to be religiously observant. Those who knowingly attempt to conflate Sharia with civil law are truly anti-Muslim. (By the way, I am not Muslim, but I am also smart enough to study and read.)",

Protection of the Dolly Varden/Bull Trout whose primary diet is the eggs of endangered salmon and steelhead and closure of well managed state hatcheries has left the runs at a fraction of what they could be. Everything managed in Washington is done for political purposes.",

The SCOTUS approach to the U.S. Constitution is a good example of this. \n\nAs for your other question, I will cringingly veer off topic. When it comes to laws that provide special consideration to religious corporations (such as ERISA exemptions), I do not see how matters of faith should constrain the business decision of the corporation from availing itself of those laws.

His knowledge come from his own eyes and not from any extrajudicial denunciation or any inquiry that he might set up. But these are unusual circumstances. Most of the bishops’ knowledge comes from someone complaining to him about the abuse by a priest under his control, and those allegations are covered by the secret. Those who accidentally come across this information are also bound by the secret. Francis knows about the secret because the Argentinian protocol which was two years in the drafting, was signed off by his fellow bishops one month after he became pope.

Amazing that Traddies are using a computer, use smart phones drive cars, live in modern homes, everything else modern---and they think that the Church doesn't/can't up-date its understanding of Biblical studies, Spirituality, and Theology.  They never heard of Pius XII's documents such as: 'Mediator Dei' -1947---laity are true participants in the Mass, or 'Humani Generis'-1950---Catholic theologians are to use modern scholarship in their research and 'Divino Afflante Spiritu'--1943--Biblical scholar were to use modern methods of criticism in researching and studying the Bible. \n\nThe church is not/should not be opposed to GROWING and RESPONDING to the needs of God's People.",

The big factor (as others have pointed out) is the ongoing substitution of natural gas for coal in many energy-intensive applications.  The surge in natural gas production was due to advances in fracking technology, and almost exclusively from private or state lands, not Federal.  If anything, the Obama Administration has stood squarely in the way of this change - remember how he told us in 2008, \"We just can't drill our way to energy independence!\"  Well, we could, and we did.  :-/  And CO2 emissions went down.

Thus all payroll taxes received equally from workers and businesses are returned many times  only to the workers. One third of Government revenue may be from these taxes, but equal almost half of Government spending. Obama was right in his quote and it is not rhetoric. There are many examples of no matter where one starts in life, they can be very successful with hard work and ambition. Dr. Ben Carson as well as President Obama are both great examples of this.

I also believe that attempts to manipulate what information is made available to the public via the Fourth Estate (news cycle), as opposed to documents and reports that require expertise or special research,  is very important for making our Democracy work.  The press seems to do an O.K. job keeping us informed as \"new facts\" emerge, I'll go with that it works 99.9% of the time.  How and where Ben Schultz suffered his injury could hardly be construed as a half truth or fake news.",

They get passed by politicians and activists without consideration for the downstream effects, go to court and are litigated away for millions and millions, then come back in another, slightly-different form. \nAs for the demand for hybrid seed: it fluctuates, and at this point the supply is higher than the demand.

Knife attacks are just as deadly as what happened in Vegas? No one uses assault rifles or bump stocks to kill? Tell that to the dead bodies on the Vegas strip. Why do you need to insist on the rights of gun \"enthusiasts\" such as Stephen Paddock to own a device that is clearly designed to get around prohibitions on automatic fire weapons? There is no reason for a civilian to have auto fire. None. At some point my right to walk around the streets without getting shot trumps your right to own 7,814,927 guns which have been modified to skirt the law.",

Or they could close the park and open it for subsistence hunting briefly every year  like they originally intended to do. Native to the park or not that has been their home since the 20's. It isn't like they hitch hiked here.Somehow shooting goats, we brought here, from helicopters seems extremely creepy and somewhat immoral to me. Opening the park up to subsistence hunt some of the goats would likely be the most humane and least expensive Then the federal and state agencies could spend the money on something else.",

The federal park staff are experts at training visitors on how to avoid bear conflicts, how to store your food in bear proof containers (which are available)  and what do in case of a bear attack that you have to participate in or you do not get a permit to use the park for hiking and camping in the park itself and not just go on a public or private bus trip through the park. The park staff ride make their rounds on the road system of the park and they often stop traffic on the road when bears are on or near the road. They are not \"nice\" they are tough on park users when a bear is sighted and they let you know in no uncertain terms when to back off and leave the bear alone. I have never seen the park rangers being anything but serious when it comes to wildlife encounters when it involves public safety. They are on the job!",

This is not to say that they have any right to hate Muslims but they are justified in being wary. Hating Muslims is a phobia but being apprehensive in their company is not hatred.

However, patient accountability/stewardship is also an important factor that is often not discussed (political suicide). There are many patients who come for 3rd, 4th, 5th opinions and are told the exact same thing. Patients who demand blood work and other investigations. Patients who have family doctors but go to ERs as the time is more convenient etc. This is driven by the fact patients do not know the costs to the healthcare system for such visits.  There are some countries that limit the # of '2nd opinions' people can seek, but again introducing this will likely be political suicide.\nOverall though there needs to be a closer look at our healthcare system structure, payment models, as the current climate of having doctors work even harder, longer hours, for less pay is going to end up looking like the NHS doctor exodus.",

Christ prayed for Peter that Peter's Faith would fail not.   Peter became the first pope after the Resurrection, when Christ told Peter to Feed His Sheep.  \n\nVatican I, as well as any ecumenical council confirmed by a pope, cannot contain error when it teaches on faith or morals solemnly to the universal Church.   \n\nNumerous popes (such as Eugene IV) have taught ex cathedra that there is no salvation outside the Church.   Almost no one assents to this today.  Even groups like SSPX, SSPV, and CMRI reject this Dogma.  \n\nWith most liturgical conservatives today, there is no real Faith:   just a bunch of incense and fancy chasubles with no solid Faith underneath.",

Which neighborhoods have their characters permanently changed?  What of the resident who may have spent a lifetime working and saving to afford this very neighborhood?  What farmland gets paved?  Do we impose growth boundaries, knowing they inflate land value?\n\nWe need to calmly and efficiently address the issues, but it is difficult to be optomistic.  Witness the 11 year struggle to permit Ho'opili with its 3,500 affordable homes, or the hysteria over how six multimillion dollar condos at Kahala will \"ruin\" the area.

People hear a person speaking with real passion it stirs them as well, it's the key to any persuasive speech.  People will respond to emotion, laughter, anger, crying.  We all fell those things, we understand those things, we experience empathy with the speaker.   \n\nAge old story isn't it, the rational versus the emotional?    Human civilization has survived because of our ability to manage both.  Individuals can't always be in perfect balance, but we live in community, drawing from a variety of skills and gifts.  That doesn't make us 'right' about all things, it does make us stronger.",

If we discovered a burning bush like Moses saw in the Bible then many would see that as justification for the Bible being literally true. But in reality that would just point to a burning-bush phenomena in the desert. Maybe it has some correlation to the Bible. But that's not logical to say it justifies the whole. Much of religious doctrine is built this way. This bible verse justifies that one and so on. The Bible doesn't actually work this way, people just say it does. It's circular.\n\nWhat you are doing takes a measure of faith. With that faith should go humility, not judgement.",

Their own leaders reject their council.  Those same leaders demand they hold firm to teaching the priests themselves may no longer believe.

And when all the dust settles, they stand along: old, abandoned, and wondering what their lives have meant.\n\nI cannot help believe that it's way past time for the church to reboot itself.

We are not gifted by God to be richer than others, some merely took what was not rightfully theirs and became dynasty's of wealth for themselves.\nToday that is even more true\n Now that those resources are mostly taken, there is little upward mobility left for the majority of American citizens. The only refuge is to put back into place laws and policies which were taken out during the 80's and 90's. Get rid of these useless 401k's which only bankroll Wall Street and the top 20%. Bring back policies that put companies on the hook for their workers' retirements as it was in my Dad's time.",

As it is, they are slowly making up ground and have games in hand on almost every team in the conference.\n\nIf they play as well as they have in the past two months the rest of the way, they’re tracking to finish with 92 points, which should put them in the wild-card conversation.\n\nPlus ca change....\n\nYour Leafs fans, been there, done that.",

For example, most of the Sitkas in Homer that are currently under attack will be back to 100% canopy within eight years.  Large insect attacks such as the Pine beetle epidemic in Canada and the Western U.S., or those observed in the Kenai in the previous three decades are reliant upon conditions that are both favorable to insect survival (such as warmer winters, which decrease frost mortality), and detrimental to the forest.

In the previous nine years, economic growth averaged 3.4 per cent per year.\n4) Harper's biggest screw-up was the two point cut in the GST which every economist warned them was a terrible idea, and was the main reason they went into massive deficit.\nIf the above is what an MA brings, I will go with the BA any day, thx.",

What will be the impact of global warming and in a world of approaching eight billion humans, what can realistically be done to eliminate human generated climate change.  The science surrounding the predictions of what a few degrees of warming will do to the world is much more complex than the prediction of the warming itself.  Countries like Canada, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, etc. would benefit greatly from warming.  Greenland could truly be green.  Tropical forests are lush.  Increased CO2 may add vigor to plant growth.  The real science is in determining consequences.  Trump and crew apparently believe that a warmer world will not be so bad.

I'm simply looking at the way the players are CRUSHING the ball... for home runs and connected extra base hits. Houston could be a hitter's park... take a look at last night... one of the homers was still rising as it hit the second level up high, estimated easily at 440 ft... and still rising. Yeah, I watched the Mick, Killebrew, Howard, McCovey, Mays, Aaron and a number of sluggers hit monstrous homers in the past.

Both proposals could cost the industry billions, undermine its ability to develop new cures and, in the case of imports, possibly compromise safety, industry officials contend.\n\nMuch of the bargaining took place in July at a meeting in the Roosevelt Room, just off the Oval Office, a person familiar with the discussions said. In attendance were Tauzin, several industry chief executives -- including those from Abbott Laboratories, Merck and Pfizer -- White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and White House aides.\"",

Good Americans like Henry Ford and Charles Lindberg supported Hitler and his views about Jews. In fact, Hitler gave Ford the highest civilian honor possible from Nazi Germany.

They are losing money so no wonder they are upset. Now if you lower the pay or make management earn their pay by a percent of what shareholders earn in dividends then you have a better system and happier shareholders. Lets say shareholders expect 3.00 per share in dividends minimum. If you take 2013 $7,456,151 pay for O&D and cut it in half that leaves $3,728,082 that goes to 21,000 shareholders x 100 shares each = 2,100,000 shares = $1.77 extra per share on top of $1.54 = $3.31 per share.

Again, strictly from the Bible's message, God does not \"see\" what you \"see\" (a transcendent God).  The overriding issue for the entire world concerns is solely God's sovereignty and the vindication of His name.  It is not you, not me, and not Jehovah's Witnesses. \n\nHowever, Jehovah's witnesses are message bearers (Witnesses).  We are bearing the message that Jehovah is the true God, His purpose has always been the same.  That purpose does not include unrighteousness.  Therefore, the days of unrighteousness are numbered.  His Kingdom is the means by which He will restore this Earth to His original purpose.   Still, that restoration  is secondary to the vindication of His name and the restoration of His sovereignty among all creation.  Jehovah's Witnesses are the only people on Earth making this message known.",

It also suggests that, if the photos are taken by someone of someone else underage, the result is child pornography.  Considering the relative naievete of many kids, it's unlikely those thoughts occur to them.\n\nIn the end, the whole thing suggests a need for more education, hopefully by the parents.

Fortunately for us we have a Permanent Fund that can continue to generate significant earnings to partially fund State government and reduce, but not eliminate, the need for new taxes that are harmful to people and the businesses that employ them.",

Find the commandments difficult in the circumstances of your life? Turn up; trust God; and let Him do the work. Live a joyful life of sacrifice in the circumstances we find ourselves in.

My gripe with the Pope is that he has allowed a situation to develop over AL whereby it is being interpreted differently by bishops and bishops' conferences throughout the world.\nWhen Pope St John II spoke on the doctrinal matter of women's ordination he did it 'to confirm the brethren in order that no doubt might remain'. Pope Francis has studiously ignored pleas from scholars, priests and even cardinals to remove all doubt about the Exhortation.\n2. Of course those posts had everything to do with religion, they were centred mainly on abortion and religious freedom. Hillary's manifesto I concluded was downright anti-Catholic and that the Catholic Church would find him a more sympathetic President than her.

HIs reasons for such prudence are; Massive debt by Canadians, evidence that Canadian businesses are investing less because of NAFTA uncertainty, GDP growth strong but primarily from oil+gas/real estate and muted inflation.\n\nMonetary policy is cautious while fiscal policy from Trudeau and Morneau is spendthrift.   The PM and his finance minister forget that the 2008/09 economic crisis hit us, almost overnight.  At any moment a massive shock could hit us, the USA or the world.  Deficit spending at a time of positive GDP growth is folly. We should be running surpluses, good ones, for as long as we can.",
