I've done a lot of reading about economics and climate change, and recently read a bunch of things on will power and addiction.  You are correct that greed has been around a very long time.  Corporations did not invent greed.  Heck, that's the point of King, a story that certainly corporations.  It does, though, boggle my mind that the Exxon folks could do quality research on climate change and then the \"officers\" of Exxon could lie about their own findings.  The corporate officers are not the corporation, but individual people.  My only explanation for such individual behavior is addiction to greed.  I don't think the individuals were sinister \"heh, heh, heh\" evil individuals who are out to destroy the world.  I am quite aware of how corporations work.

For instance, CPT Kahn died in 2004 long before Kahn's declaration of \"“If it was up to Donald Trump, he (his son, CPT Kahn) never would have been in America.”  Or, are there Muslim band statements of Trump in 2004/5? Much like this whole string of posts, we are bouncing all over the place to fit the individual narrative we want.\n\nBut let's say Trump mean't exactly what he said.  To me the proper response (after the initial shock) would be, \"Mr Trump are you saying that on day X, zero Muslims will be allowed into the US, is that correct?\"  And, since this is such a wild statement, wouldn't it be more beneficial to ask follow-up questions to ensure that we understand exactly what he meant and how long the ban would be in place?  Kind of like giving a man enough rope to hang himself?",

After it's done, it means less opportunity for everyone to earn money doing that Labor, so less Land is available, but the product of the Labor itself is a kind of Land, in turn, as it's not Labor when it is not actively undertaken;it's also opportunity to do better things\n\nIf Labor is voluntary to do I don't mind taxes on Labor or the ensuring Capital, taxes that justify themselves as an attempt to compensate those who don't want to enclose the results of Labor as much and consequently obtain much less capital in comparison, and to compensate those who wanted to do the more simple Labor of times past, for a lot of Capital. There's also taxing natural Land.",

IF the Peg Jets 1.0 had not flown the coop and moved to Arizona, Austen Matthews would not have become a Coyote's fan and taken up hockey and developed into a potential NHL superstar. The Leafs after winning the 2016 draft lottery would have chosen Patrick Laine if there was no hockey playing Austen Matthews and a whole different scenario would be developing in Leafland. Therefore the Leafs can thank the WHA and Jets 1.0 for being able to choose Austen Matthews and finally having the key building block to possibly lead them to the promised land.\n\nMerry Christmas to all.",

After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire.\nIf that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia.\nLast year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it.\nTerrorists are brutal. A lot of terrorists are Muslim. That does NOT make all Muslims dogs.\nIf a man from Arvada gets angry at his ex-wife and burns down her home with her in it, are all Arvadans to be considered dogs?",

The simple fact is that they could not compete just as blue collar workers could not compete with their parents back in the day.

To say you empathize implies that you get where the other person is coming from, you 'feel their pain'.  Come now, do you really?  It is far more accurate to say that you are sympathetic to the other, that you have compassion for their plight.  Maybe you'll even stir yourself to help out.

Eliminate travel unless it's approved by say the Governor. Move the legislature to using State fleet vehicles and housing rather than per diem and moving POVs in Juneau.\nConsolidate operations in several areas to reduce duplicate work within departments and the state government as a whole.\nRepeal SB21 oil tax breaks\nReduce subsidies to UA system, begin converting UA to an endowment operated school system.\nImplement a state income tax at a low rate and \"buy out\" Alaskans from the PFD (buy out of say, $10-$15k per eligible individual who has received a dividend at least the last 5-7 years) and end future dividend payments entirely. Restructure the PFD so all earnings go towards the state budget in lean times or improving principal in wealthy times",

Statistical evidence is that misconduct (or legal but unwise use) of firearms is almost never associated with collections - the typical collector’s piece is never discharged (and loses value if it is used and worn). The path to “put a dent in these shootings” surely lies in figuring out how to deter or prevent them in the first place? My suggestion is to advocate both civic and firearms education. Spread the ethic that to call the police AND disclose ALL you know is the BEST path to a civil community.

In doing so the Liberals deliberately short-changed the BC education system for over a decade. Last November the Supreme Court restored the 2002 contract, forcing the BC government to restore funding to that level. How much did the Liberals take from education?\n\n\"In 2014, school superintendents’ association estimated it would cost more than $1 billion a year to return to 2002 service levels.\"\n\nThat's how the Liberals 'balanced the budget': by taking money from school kids while giving big corporations tax breaks.",

This included fights behind doors in thin-walled offices, instigated by the manager.  While the other employees couldn't hear what was said, they could hear raised voices.

It is an act of domination – just like refusal of service to black or Jewish people or inter-racial couples. \"\nSo, isn't it an act of domination when a photographer or baker, etc., is now forced to provide their services for a same sex wedding by the government? Refusing to provide your services for a same sex wedding is not even close to simply refusing to serve those same persons in the usual day to day dealings in life.\nAnd why is it just a problem of people drawing lines only from a religious standpoint? Plenty of people have refused to serve certain people or groups for political reasons and no one says anything. But refuse on religious grounds and people get sued. This is flat out wrong.",

Being misandristic and racist is the meme of the day for millennials of color in today's liberal media. King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families.

I have two grand-daughers of Mexican-American heritage who have clearly Spanish family names who live on the Mainland. I only hope a pray that they have not felt a similar pain. In the comments section below this article I note that some readers try to dismiss Mr. Trump's bigotry, while others mention that the Hawai'i Republican Party has endorsed him for President. I say to the defenders of Donald Trump and to the bulk of the Hawai'i Republican Party; SHAME ! Your besmirch yourselves and our islands with your thoughtlessness. How can you look in a mirror?",

Over the past six years I have had say 7 or 8 different aboriginal families as tenants. The good ones were those that paid the rent, didn't damage the place, and still wanted to cut their lease short after just a few months. The other half thrashed the place, and stopped paying rent altogether under a huge variety of excuses.

No one is profiling them. No one is trying to deport them. They get to vote if they want to. They are the only demographic dying younger and they are killing themselves with their behaviors. As technology and globalization make bigotry and racism less profitable, they refuse to change with the times. On some deep level they realize that merit and equality for all are social and economic demotions for them. They would rather die than admit this truth. Sadly, like they do in their families when they commit murder suicides, they want to take the rest of us down with them if they can't have their way. Then along came Russia with their boy Trump. They treat him like their savior. This even though he has never saved anyone but himself. Being ignorant is not a good strategy for success in the 21st century.",

In my experience the studs make the difference between stopping the car safely and ending up in the ditch or rear ending another car. Yes we should drive slowly enough that we can stop safely and we should give the car ahead of us plenty of room, but we make mistakes. Some intersections are slicker than others. Sometimes there is low visibility and the car in front stops or slows suddenly. I'm interested in Blizzaks and would like to see results for coming downhill into icy intersections at 32 degrees.

Some years it worked, sometimes not. You may be surprised to learn that often the students dictate the tone of the class in that respect, voicing concerns about triggering topics and such. It makes it hard as a professor to foster debate when students are almost afraid to hear it. And I taught first year courses, so, as you can see, this wasn't something they learned from university.

Animals that are fed glyphosate-sprayed crops ingest the glyphosate, which is released from the plant proteins they digest. The animal incorporates glyphosate as it makes collagen, which taints bone broth made from animals fed glyphosate-treated crops. People vary in their vulnerability to glyphosate.

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Many people do not believe sexual preference constitutes race. It has not been proven people are actually born gay and therefore ARE technically a race of people by DNA etc. What the law has done in business is to create a war in the workplace. The pecking order works like this: Gay women create cliques and take over the business. Straight women are second class citizens. People of color (gay or not) are 3rd class citizens. All straight men must be eliminated from the business-especially white males and gay males are considered for ejection on a case by case basis. I watched this happen to a city business.

I love the aroma and have never forgotten the magic that it bestowed on me and my siblings.  I tried many times to replicate that same aroma but to no avail.

Well, before commenters fight for the chance to tell us that we can't trust polls and surveys, The September story revealed an interesting fact: \n\n\"When survey respondents were told that over the last few years, approximately 250,000 new immigrants came to Canada each year, 59 per cent said that was about the right number. A quarter of respondents – 25 per cent – said that was too many, while 8 per cent said that was too few.\"\n\nOct. 31, govt. 's new plan--in essence: as many as 320,000 new immigrants in  2017 (2016 plan: 305,000) Refugee numbers: down from 2016 (to 43,500 about 14%), but \"economic\": up to  57.5%--in 3 programs, an increase of 23%, (Canadian Immigation news) \n\nHowever: Are these targets related to actual job opportunities?

My take from this report was that LTD is hostile to outsiders performing counts on LTD \"property.\" I feel that no transportation district can understand its own performance without building data-collection in. The next major project for LTD should be to install \"smart card\" readers into all buses, and issuing \"smart cards\"  instead of tickets to all passengers. That would give them (and the public) a full understanding of how the system does or does not work. \"Smart cards\" are: The Seattle Orca card; the London Oyster card; and the SF Bay area Clipper card.\n\nIf every passenger tagged  onto and off each bus every time boarding and disembarking, LTD would understand everything about passenger statistics.

Legislators from Juneau got $175 per day, while those from outside Juneau received $234 per day. For most, that per diem amount added about $21,000 to their pay, tax-free.\n\nIf I paid you $88,000 a year and you did not do your job,  I would fire you.

How long did it take to accumulate the $150K?  Why buy in 2 years and not now?    People need to ensure that their goals and objectives are reasonable and realistic to avoid settling for inferior rates of return.  So if that 2 year plan is more likely to be closer to a 5 year plan investing at least some of the money in equities is probably a better route.\n\nIt really comes down to how important is it to have $X available on a specific date?",

After Augustus (who needed neither soldiers nor a mob to maintain his control), the emperors relied heavily on the Praetorians--not \"the mob\"--to uphold their power.  The Roman street intervened only once, that I can recall, in the first century AD--in 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, Galba made an abortive attempt to arouse the people in his favor.  After Vespasian assumed the purple, the emperors relied solely on the Praetorians and the legions to maintain themselves in power--which meant they could unmake an emperor and make a new one.  When the legions revolted and marched on Rome, sometimes the mob dragged him out and killed him first.  But the people, as such, had no power.",

It can get blurry whether or not some of these organizations help people in order to be in a position to proselytize to those down on their luck or if they do it strictly out of a charitable impulse. \nA different approach to charity is that of the Islamic faith called Zakat--the third pillar of Islam. Zakat consists of the compulsory giving of a set proportion of one's wealth to charity and is considered a type of worship and of self-purification. Freeing oneself from the love of possessions and greed, from the love of money and from love of oneself are some of the major goals of this ritual giving. What's interesting about this approach is the focus on how giving edifies the giver rather than the receiver. Sometimes it seems like the Christian approach has more to do with providing social status to the giver. In Zakat, the donations are frequently private or anonymous.",

I think I can agree with you that we don't have adequate data to determine there is not a harm to Kauai / etc. from pesticide use (be it from seed companies, government, or homeowners). However, I think where we disagree is that this doesn't necessitate requiring seed companies, the government or homeowners to stop using pesticides completely (i.e. the precautionary principle).

When the term was reintroduced in the 1980s in connection with Augusto Pinochet's economic reforms in Chile, the usage of the term had shifted.

Suncor reported net earnings of $392 million, or 24 cents per share.Oct 27, 2016 and they make their money by being clever. You see Western Canada Select (WCS) is made mostly by blending bitumen with US shale oil condensate and it sells for a deep discount to light, sweet crude, WTI .  WTI is selling at about $52.00 and WCS is selling at maybe $40.00  but those smart chaps at Suncor spend an extra $8 to $10 bucks or so and heavily refine bitumen into Synthetic crude, which sells for a few bucks more/bbl than WTI.

How quaint....\nNow we seem stuck in an rut when it comes to oil, oil revenue and oil influence on our government.

It didn't pass the stink test but we live with it today.\nThe truth is we need to diversify our economy so that no one industry can dominate our affairs. Duh....

Having effective communication and keeping exiting systems clear and well lit using battery backup system lighting, clear signage, fire corridors properly done for egress, are all key elements for safety.

Surely they don't like free parking. Some don't like bikes not paying their share. Now that cyclists are going to pay their fair share, why are motorists getting free parking?\nOn average, cities allocated 7 parking spaces for each car. This is because they design for the maximum possible users, so most of the time the space sits empty.\nIdeally the city should implement demand pricing like any market-based system. As the spaces become more scarce, the price goes up. That's capitalism.\nYes, they do provide a couple of car spaces for up to 7 bikes.

By all means, the ACA needs to be improved; but clearly Trump has no plan to do that.

Also second is the same war the feminist groups are waging against the male elite is adding to it fear and even paranoia of males in general including perspective male teachers.

What about short-term rentals over 31 days that do not require any permit? Are the short-term rentals (over 31 days, but not year-round) reflected in the percentage of rental-occupied homes? I'm assuming they are, so how does that actually affect the availability of rental units available for full-time residents?

A 60 watt equivalent LED uses 10 watts/33 BTU total so requires ~100 Diesel BTU's to generate.  A decent diesel stove is 80+% efficient making it the heat source of choice.  Moreover, LED's by dint of less demand allow a smaller generating capacity or allow for an entire engine to be shut down if  the efficiencies in a community are scaled.  They also have proportionally less line loss from generator to bulb, aka distribution loss.

It's never written on their foreheads.  So people like you instead of playing the offended should concede that there is a huge problem with islam.

It was a war. Certainly burning alive isn't sanctioned by the Geneva Conventions, but ISIL isn't a signatory. Estimates of the size of ISIL, worldwide, range from 40K to 200K fighters. There are 1.6 billion mostly peaceful Muslims, and that includes the vast majority of Muslims in warring states. ISIL burned a pilot. In Texas recently, drunken white men roped an older black man and dragged him to death behind a pickup. In Wyoming drunks beat up a gay man and tied him to a barbed wire fence to freeze to death.

The white supremacists and Nazi groups like the ones rallying in Charlottesville preach hate and inferiority of blacks, Jews, and non-whites who should be deprived of rights, deprived of government benefits except those paid for by black taxes in black communities, forced to live apart from whites, and not entitled to the superior position and entitlements of whites in our country and society.",

A very important point that you failed to mention probably because it doesn't support your position of we should build it no matter what it costs.  That poll basically means we would like it to be finished, but we (the taxpayer) don't want to spend anymore money on it which basically means either the City and/or the State have to magically pull money out of thin air, or the project is going to stop when they run out of money.  By my estimates, they may not even reach Middle Street if the cost overruns keep going up at the rate that they have been going up by.  If that's the case, maybe they should stop it at the airport?  At least it would give west side residents a cheap way to get to the airport when they go on Vacation.

We could instead just cut our bloated governments, primarily via wage reductions that get bigger the more people make.  Then add attrition, and outright layoffs focused on the older staff who have already made $$$ for years, not the eager youngsters.  Throw in a similar pension reform, i.e. \"You will only get back what you paid in, not 50% more,\" and deficits would vanish.  Raise rates, house prices fall, back to normalcy!",

Chinese and Vietnamese manufacturers have been able to borrow at low cost to build factories to produce goods to compete in the U.S. \nThe Trump solution, however, increases costs. A 45% tariff increase would boost the cost of everything imported from China on a one-for-one basis.

This seems to be new. Not all U.S. presidents have been sterling character models. But never has there been one so disrespectful of people, devoid of common decency and so disrespectful of the traditions that have held American democracy together, especially willingness to accept our differences.\n\nIt's not unreasonable to label this behavior evil, both in moral and functional terms. And it's not unreasonable to assume, unless they declare otherwise, as Sens. Murkowski and Sullivan did, that those who voted for the man accept the evil, believe as he believes. Nothing good can come of trafficking with evil.\"\n\nThanks Steve, may your writings be seen far and wide.",

Cats are obligate carnivores and a waste of protein and resources.  I 100% support euthanasia of all feral cats and support mandatory neutering of owned cats prior to the first litter, with fines and penalties for failure to comply.  We need strict licensing laws for dogs and cats alike, with containment requirements, and mandatory microchipping, so ownership and vaccinations can be registered.  If you love feral cats, then be a responsible adult about it and keep them at your place and use a containment fence, neuter, license, register, deflea, deworm, and keep vaccination records accurately.

This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Current transit riders, will  surely take an easier route. People that are on the freeway now, will consider if they improve, (but they are predisposed to drive currently.)
