Most men are married in our church, so they too have no authority.  Optional celibacy will open a flood gate to married men-which is why this priest, in the article, described that thousands of married men will jump right in, the moment the pope gives the ok -thousands in Brazil alone.  So all those women who have been leading parishes as lay ministers are gone & replaced, even if they are made deacons they have no authority.\n\nCelibacy causes no one harm so it is not wrong & no one has to be a priest.  I have no problem with optional celibacy if we are ordaining married women too but it should not be at the cost of women.  Black men have a voice in our church.  Women do not.",

After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

Now that idiot whites want painkillers, we decide a more empathetic and rational treatment approach is appropriate. However, instead of blaming idiot whites for wanting oxy-whatever for any tiny scratch, we blame doctors and pharmaceutical companies. A decade or so ago doctors lamented the problem of pain management. Now, doctors trying to solve pain issues must also be lie detector examiners or risk losing their licenses.

What that is is not being a woman, and moving out of the family world of women and children to become a (real) man. The final bastion of separate identity is the power of representing God. If women actually are seen as representing God then men are really not 'separate but more equal', which is what their identity has largely been built on. They are actually then 'less equal' in their own eyes because they can't give birth. That's one reason they push the strange analogy that 'women can't be priests like men can't give birth', which really makes no sense at all.",

Nevertheless, a terrorist got through and attacked, shot, maimed and killed lots of innocent people and got away. \n\nIt just goes to show that Muslim terrorists can get through if and when they really want to. And we're not immune in Canada. Canadians will have to be very wary and vigilant. Who knows when some moderate Muslim will turn radical and lash out?  It's happened before in Canada. It will probably happen again.",

Fishkiller said “Not yet but I still have time.” \n\nJames Mason 771 said killing Mexicans at “a hundred bucks per head” sounded reasonable. These are potential terrorists, and there are more on these pages.",

These are very greedy and envious people that I predict will once and for all be soundly defeated in the American society and are soon to be swept off the social scene much to the chagrin of the current republican leadership, the Koch brothers,  and the JP II supporters in the RCC church.  These people have not accepted the revelations of the Spirit, but instead have looked toward their own power and greed.  They are a very envious group of mostly white men that are doomed to fail...

Go back a 150 years or so when America was \"great\" because it sure s HELL is not great now and has not been for years/decades.\n\nMight as well bring back slavery. As an economic \"model\", it's unbeatable. There was a reason why the United States became as wealthy as they did, and education/brains was NOT that reason.  \n\n.",

In this 2nd decade of the 21st European religious century, there is a tendency to white-wash the past, for emo-cringe reasons. In Hawaii, with the overthrow of the Kingdom in 1893 and the following annexation in 1898, the Hawaiian language was entirely banned from schools and government, and discouraged elsewhere. The Native Hawaiian culture was squashed because it was a \"terrorist threat\" to the Religious Republic of Hawaii. The ban of the Native Hawaiian language and culture in schools and government wasn't lifted until 1978.",

He was notified in July 2013 that his ambassador, Archbishop Wesolowski, was sexually abusing poor street boys in Santo Domingo, dismissed him but left him a free man. As reported by Corriere Della Sera In Sept. 2014, Wesolowski was found by Italian police with more than 100,000 computer files of pornography. \"Images show youngsters aged between 13 and 17 being humiliated for the camera, filmed naked and forced to have sexual relations with each other or with adults,\" i.e. probable victims of human trafficking.",

From behind walls, rocks, and trees, and from houses they poured their fire into the columns of Redcoats, while the frustrated Regulars found few targets for their accustomed volleys or bayonet charges. Only the arrival of reinforcements sent by Gage enabled the British column to get back to the safety of Boston. At day's end the British counted 273 casualties out of a total of 1,800 men engaged; American casualties numbered 95 men, including the toll at Lexington. What happened was hardly a tribute to the marksmanship of New England farmers - it has been estimated 75,000 shots poured from their muskets that day - but it did testify to a stern determination of the people of Massachusetts to resist any attempt by the British to impose their will by armed force.\nhttp://colonialwarsct.org/1775_lex_alarm.htm",

Furthermore, over-regulation will simply drive business away or cause tour operators to implement token solutions (such as a safety video nobody watches). What I would advocate is education + effective regulation (informed by data and input from businesses and safety experts) + cultural change. One of the major promoters of safety can be the Hawaii residents who aren't drowning at such high rates. Tourists rarely go out without asking hotel staff, or checking online sources such as yelp/blog. When we see tourists doing stupid dangerous things, say something... and say it with Aloha.

Their brick and mortar stores are not open on Sundays for business because it is the Sabbath yet they run advertisements in the Sunday paper and you can order online from their website every Sunday, so, really they are doing business on the Sabbath.  I guess they think they're fooling everyone because their brick and mortar stores are closed Sundays.  Their businesses keep running and the dollars still pour into their coffers even if you can't walk into the stores.  While they might be sitting in a church pew, they do have employees working on the Sabbath. Maybe in their mind it doesn't violate the Sabbath if the shopper can't see the employee working on the other end of the online store.\n\nThe best thing I can suggest about Hobby Lobby is to not patronize them.",

Rather than point out that Jesus used hyperbole on more than one occasion (gouging out one's eye, cutting off limbs, etc.) I said we couldn't know where Judas was. She got agitated, mentioned the wildly popular Bishop Sheen from the '40's in some context to bolster her argument. \n\nThe funny thing is, I could have told her that when Clare Boothe Luce was taking instructions from Bishop Sheen she was having real problems accepting the existence of hell.

The teaching portion of the faculty is cost effective in supporting the primary educational function of the University.  Research is a secondary function of the University and it is very expensive.  Tenure-track faculty are typically heavily involved in research which requires substantial time.  Such faculty may teach only one course per term (or none).

In my opinion, the best way to solve this issue is to discontinue all the various kinds of visas in favour of only one - a 5-year non-renewable immigrant visa.

The only large bank discount broker that fails to provide on line purchases of GICS, likely to be a more attractive option in the near future, is TD Direct Investing. I assume that TD Direct Investing does not want clients to buy lower margin and illiquid investments. Far better for clients to be buying and selling IPOs on a regular basis.",

How about the financial crisis of the early 1990's, when all of the large Canadian \"Trust\" companies disappeared?  The largest trust company was Royal Trust.  The government arranged to have Royal Banl take over what was left of Royal Trust.  The shareholders of Royal Trust received nothing, since the company had a negative value.   The financial crisis of the early 1990's  was created by a collapse in over priced real estate.  Strange how history keeps repeating.  In a convoluted way, the financial institutions are right, that there is too much regulation - considering that the regulation is ineffective.",

Jesus went on about humility in his followers, but the Church recognizes that it is necessary to be lead by Princes, dressed as Princes, so humility for the followers of the Apostles is out.  These are just a few examples where the Church had to jettison those scriptural passages that didn't work.  You can have scripture, or you can have the Holy Mother Church, lead by Our Holy Father.

In addition, studies have shown in the past that there is a point where high cap gains rates will encourage people to hold on to their gains, not liquidate a thereby not generate  as much tax revenue. There is probably evidence of the effect of the inclusion rates based on what happened to government cap gain revenue when the rate was lowered by Paul Martin from 75% tp 50%. My guess is that not much tax revenue was lost as there were more trades generating less revenue per trade. I would bet that if the government was looking for more tax revenue that the best option would be to lower the inclusion rate to something like 25% which would encourage Canadians to move from one investment to another with lower tax ramifications. Again, fewer taxes per trade but more trades. Very significant for aging Canadians.\nI would encourage everyone to write",

I do blame developers, politicians, the law and greedy home owners. There so many people raising their rent just cause they can cause their neighbors are high so they think they can do the same. Developers are in the wrong too cause I hear when Wailea was built the developers was suppose to make affordable housing too for the workers there and they didn't do that. Politicians and the law let this happen. We need rent control here on Hawai'i. It's wrong how landlords can raise your rent hundreds of dollars in just one month. My aunty's rent raised $700 in one jump. My neighbor got asked to move cause the landlord is gonna fix it up and raise the rent from $1,200 to $2,000 which practically makes him homeless. He was in the process of fixing his car up to live in. It's so sad. There was a time we could make minimum wage and be able to live just fine.",

Believe me, Holy Father.  It is not the priest who waves a magic wand to make a \"holy sacrament\" - it is the faith of the believer that recognizes God's presence.\n\n2) While \"tradition\" is important, it is not sacred.

Around Vancouver and Toronto, a major contributor to their debts is that they have to compete with billions of dollars in overseas money that floods in and skyrockets house prices in bidding competitions, all a result of social-engineering politicians, in Ottawa and Quebec and Vancouver and Victoria, flirting for years with folks carrying big suitcases of overseas money (investor immigrant programs and easy visa exceptions to foreigner taxes).\n\nWhy ON  EARTH would any country want to follow Canada's example in economics?\n\nWhy?\n\nIs massive family debt, unaffordable housing, low paying urban jobs and crippling government debt loads supposed to be somehow a noble goal?",

By in large head contact is illegal for all minor hockey players regardless of what the NHL is doing, so I believe we are already on the right track.  \nIf the NHL wants to continue to ignore the problem then I sincerely hope those expansion fees are being well invested because they'll need all the money they can find to settle lawsuits.",

I simply believe in making factually-based decisons and eliminate as many unknowns as possible. Many at my table of six do the same. I realize this is not you.",

How can we talk about production per acre when we are comparing massive operations to small organic operations? \n\nTaking mainly one statistic and using that to make some final judgement about whether one is more beneficial to the consumer or not doesn't do justice to the myriad of issues surrounding this comparison. Think about waste, think about the production of these pesticides and inorganic/synthetic fertilizers, consider how those are produced and the implications of the large chemical industries surrounding that. Organic farms don't use those things. \n\nReally this is an absurd comparison that has used an extremely narrow scope to again improperly frame this issue. Well done 'researchers'",

As reforms play out and conditions change, adjustments are needed. The Courts here have insisted only that changes not be retroactive in a way that would violate contracts. People move their families here to accept job offers that include specific salary and benefits promises. Historically, in some sectors, the salaries were very low and the benefits compensated. To work a lifetime at low salary and then have one's promised retirement benefits eliminated would be unjust. Contracts must be kept, so, by law, PERS payments will be made.

In fact, even the Author (obviously, a pro-2nd Amendment enthusiast) made this mistake in the article).\n\nThe Author writes, \"The federal \"assault rifle\" ban that targeted AR-15 type firearms, was implemented in 1994 and in effect for 10 years. It was not renewed in 2004, because there was no realistic difference in \"assault\" rifle crime rates from before the ban was enacted through the 10-year period it was in affect.\n\nIn truth, the AR-15, and any other similarly-functioning weapon is NOT an \"assault rifle\".  And, the legislation enacted in 1994 (HR 4296 - Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act) was not targeted for \"assault rifles\".  HR 4296 was enacted to \"prohibit the manufacture, transfer, or possession of a SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPON (SAW) as defined or listed under this Act.\" (my emphasis in ALL CAPS).",

You can't just look at what the tax will be this year and ignore that you won't be paying that tax 30 years later.\n\nAnd few people come close to saving the full $18,000/yr tax-deferral allowed.  Those that do are pretty likely to have high income (the people the left usually say should be paying more taxes).  I'd think they'd be happy about that.  \n\nAlso, the assumption that you'll be taking less in disbursements than you make now is not necessarily correct.

The number wearing Burquas is small but tripled. The Muslim religion is also a political ideology, governing every aspect of government, criminal and family law.

I go for the inexpensive places but you can get whole houses or apartments with Air BnB.  If I don't find an Air BnB place that fits my needs, then I look for a hostel, not a hotel.  \n\nWhen  I need to be at SeaTac for an early flight on Sundays, I stay in a cheap hotel/motel with van service to the airport since the Light Link Rail does not go early enough on Sunday mornings.\n\nInteresting hosts are what I look for.  I cannot find that in a hotel.",

The problem is further exacerbated by virtually no country having formally declared war since 1939. \n\nThe fact is that there have been a number of terrorist attacks affiliated with Islamic extremism on the U.S. since 2001 and Trump is determined in bringing this to a stop.  Terrorists have been able to get into the U.S. through the refugee/visa programs. Trump said he was going to do this and now it is being enacted.

Reneging on your promise to pay is theft not 'standing up against a 'bailout'' The promise has been made either declare bankruptcy and try to discharge your legal obligations legally or pay up for the promises made.   \n\nOf course the cost of that is employees are going to demand all their money up front.   They can't be screwed over that way.   Of course we don't have a budget or revenue set up to handle that so stuff will have to get cut or taxes will have to go up as a result of government trying to renege on its debts.",

Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Hillary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.\"\n\nPaul Ryan, yesterday, again agreed to these facts.  Trump himself has agreed to this set of facts.  Is it unreasonable of the Intelligence Community to determine if Trump or his team was participating in this effort?  I don't think so.  It was the FBI and DOJ who got that FISA warrant, all according to US law.",

Had the D showed up in that game, the Broncos would have made the playoffs.\n\nThe defense was also ranked 28th out of 32 in the league against the run. Not what I'd call \"superb\".

These military planes are being chartered\nfor their exclusive use and are comparable to a commercial flight except that it is on your dime.\nPrice and any others who are guilty of the same thing should be made to repay the taxpayer.\nAs far as Price, he resigned before he could be fired which is what he deserved.
