Being misandristic and racist is the meme of the day for millennials of color in today's liberal media. King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families.

Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.\" \n\nLisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.\n\nLisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men.

The GOP has spent the last 50 years recruiting white racists into the GOP. Now those white racists control the GOP. Sessions is living proof of the white racism in the core of the modern GOP, in the 21st century.",

The term refers to efforts to change government policies and laws on LGBT rights-related issues. Additionally, it has been used by social conservatives and others to describe alleged goals of LGBT rights activists, such as recruiting heterosexuals into what they term a \"homosexual lifestyle\".[1]\"  \n\nIMO, the \"real\" gay agenda is to be no longer treated as \"second-class\" citizens and be able to live their lives w/o being targeted with discrimination and much worse.  I don't feel that goal is unreasonable.  As used by those right-wing Christians it's a epithet designed to force homosexuals \"back into the closet where they belong!!!\"   Gary Crum",

This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Did they explode when they were shot?  Catch fire?  Disintegrate?  Melt?

Black men receive prison sentences 19.5 percent longer than those of white men who committed similar crimes, a 2013 report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found.",

You are correct that Juneau clock time now is closely equal to solar time during winter (Alaska Standard Time). During the summer now (under Alaska Daylight Savings Time) Anchorage is 2 hours ahead and Juneau is 1 hour ahead from solar time. Under MacKinnon's bill this relationship would remain and Juneau would be on same clock time as the west coast in the winter (when the west coast \"falls back\") but be one hour ahead of solar time. Central Alaska would be 2 hours ahead of solar time year-round. Ironically, back when Southeast was on Pacific Time for \"convenience\" sake, they were 1 hour ahead of solar time in the winter and 2 hours ahead during Daylight savings time in the summer. There is actually only a 1 hour 2 minute difference in solar time between Juneau and Anchorage. I hope I didn't make this more confusing - LOL",

Terminating choir directors, Eucharistic ministers, etc. may fall within what they can legally do -- but it falls far short of what they ought to do.

The Senate then went on to approve several Obama nominees who were leftist ideologues, some of who had very thin resumes in the area they would be leading.\n\nSo, yeah, I find it a little hypocritical that she's now voting against Trump's nominees.

The theoretical index makes changes instantaneously but the fund sponsor has to go to the market when attempting to fulfill their mandate of replicating it or issuing new units. When changes are announced in advance, there is an opportunity for arbitrageurs to trade on the change in demand of securities that are either being added or dropped from said index. The arbitrageurs profit at the expense of ETF unitholders, Smaller funds that track lesser known indices are especially vulnerable to this problem.\n\nFor more info see: https://www.bu.edu/rbfl/files/2013/09/Issue2McLaughlin.pdf",

Most studies show that electric cars, even when they're powered from \"dirty\" electric sources are STILL more environmentally friendly than gasoline cars.  This is because electricity is much more efficient at being used, so when a car gets electricity to operate, it uses nearly 100% of that energy, a gas car uses approximately 20% of it's energy, with 80% being wasted.  The Globe's stance also ignores the exceptionally polluting ways oil is taken out of the ground, and the toxic way it is turned to gasoline.  It's remarkably short sighted to assume that our power will always come from dirty sources.  Tesla is making it easier for people to have their own solar energy at home--this is the way of the future, and truly, our best chance at avoiding catastrophe.  As for the subsidies, they're a drop in the bucket compared to the multi-billions given to the oil industry--no one complains about that.",

There is no dispute among Catholic theologians on this point – even among theologians like Bellarmine who do not think that a Pope is in fact capable of being a heretic.\n            It is to be hoped that the correction of Pope Francis does not have to proceed this far, and that he will either reject the heresies he has announced or resign his office.

Not sure that many \"victimless\" crimes have been pursued that vigorously over the last few years, anyway. Many laws are silly and speak more to out-of-date morals than crimes (for  example, did you know you are committing a criminal offense (1949) if you possess what the law anachronistically calls a \"crime comic\"?)  Nobody pays much attention anyway.  \n\n2. Now about \"blue suits\"  Well, actually, in order to clear the legal backlog, Alberta--at least--is hiring MORE (Prosecutors), as well as additional \"black robes\" (judges.)  Perhaps we must look elsewhere to thin the ranks. I'm not against that!  Lots of people have their own pet \"rank-thinning\" thoughts, I'm sure.\n\n3.

In Cosby's case, the state had originally declined to prosecute citing insufficient evidence or credibility. And so she went the civil route where the burden of proof is less demanding. The fact it was revisited years later and charges laid is de-facto proof that attitudes have changed. \n\nBut there are limits to the public's willingness to take the victim's word at face value - especially where money and celebrity are involved, and even more when there are long gaps between the assault and the complaint. If true (and it might well be) doesn't each victim have a duty to prevent it happening again - even at some personal inconvenience or embarrassment?",

If this is correct and you fear that your condo building will turn into an apartment building, you should probably sell your unit and rent/buy a house somewhere else. The government would be foolish to make any changes that you allude to in your post. First, the number of available rentals would likely decrease significantly, since roughly three times as many condo buildings as opposed to apartment buildings have been built over the past decade. Further, if these units are removed from the rental market, then the rental prices will increase (i.e., supply is less than demand). Second, condo purchases would likely decrease, since who would want to buy a unit if they cannot rent it out if needed. I hope the government does not do as you suggest they should.",

While Paulin's early story clarifies the matter, anyone not clicking on that link may be misled by this story. As Unalaska is a first-class city, Mayor Marquardt does not have a vote in council matters except to break a tie. If I remember correctly, she was unopposed for a fourth or fifth term the last time out, so it's unlikely to affect her politically short of a concerted effort from outside the community.\n\nI see \"heavily supported\" and \"heavily in favor\" in two successive paragraphs regarding the 2014 vote. My math came out to a 57 to 42 percent vote in favor. In comparison, Tammie Wilson has twice been elected to her House seat with something like 75 to 80 percent of the vote.\n\nThe opinions expressed by Conwell, Holman and Kelty are further evidence of what we've gotten in return for letting big government and big corporations control the narrative.\n\nContinued below..",

The increase in cost is most effective in changing demand when that increase is transparent and obvious.  When gas goes up by 4 cents/litre and you don't know whether it is due to Cap 'n Trade or a hurricane in Texas it is less likely to change your behaviour than if you can see the change.\n\n3. The heavily bureaucratic nature of the system discourages innovation\n\n4. Ironically if/when GHG emissions are reduced it reduces demand for carbon credits, there-by decreasing the price and, perversely, this decreases the incentive to reduce GHG emissions\n\nCap and Trade exists for the purpose of obfuscating costs and spending.

In 2015 the Oregon Department of Revenue published an analysis of Oregon's income tax using data from returns for tax year 2013.  The top 20% of taxpayers contributes 69% of the revenue collected by the income tax (page 19).  The problem is that our tax system is \"too progressive\" and allows many people to pay no tax at all.  Some returns are filed to get \"free money\" in refunds even though the filer paid no tax.  We need more taxpayers.  The bottom 40% of filers pays only a little over 4% of the income tax.  I have urged this before:  eliminate the deduction for federal taxes paid; eliminate the personal exemption of $195 per person and stop giving money from taxpayers to those who have no tax liability.

This will save you from having to read all the latest #Gupta emails...do you watch TV?  Economic freedom??....ask Zuma and Co what they have done with the BILLIONS that could have been used for the disadvantaged.  Chimamanda, dont be blind ...simply used as voting fodder ...if nothing else, listen to Cyril.  Wise up and become one of the many who see the betrayal to the very foundation of the ANC .  PS.  Oops, they do have \"those metros\"..you see, you simply must not believe anything that you hear!  Go well!",

I go back to a comment I posted here at NCR the day after the election last November, that perhaps we need to go through this (a Trump presidency) in order to regain or refresh our understanding of just how far off course our democracy has gone, how fragile it really is, and how a growing segment of our population is extremely reactionary, uneducated in democratic processes, and in possession of attitudes and beliefs that spring from the deeply negative and distorted cesspools of human cognition.  As a result, the avid supporters of DJT, as small a number as they indeed are now, can never be expected to be thoughtful, reasonable or open to dialogue.\n(continued)",

If one prays as I do that \"all may be one,\" a believer would want this -- 24 Catholic different Catholic Churches attempting to live as one in Christ, sacramentally and organically.

One of the reasons for high premium increases is the refusal of the House GOP to implement the law by failing to appropriate the premium subsidies to the insurers.

Right or wrong, you are known by the company you keep (Proverbs 13:20). \nIt's very hard to view a people or demographic as marginalized when you see them being given more opportunities, yet they seem to demand more, or just take it from others.\nEquality of opportunity requires equality of effort, of action, and of responsibility.",

Over the counter and prescription drugs have killed millions, and lets not even talk about the damage booze has done to people and families over the many, many years of availability to anyone pretty much who wants it.  Legalize it, tax it and allow for its use as a recreational drug and a drug that can be used to help those who need its medicinal properties.

The way to argue the theology of sex is not the merits, since the Church will argue scripture and tradition to resist, even as they are proof texting both badly.

Where we are now is DEBT is about 31% of GDP.  Now, to reduce the DEBT to effectively zero will require DEFICITS (calculated annually) to become SURPLUSES -- something with which we are already familiar from the previous Liberal government.\n\nShort-term I don't really have a problem with DEFICIT spending, although I will concede this year's $27-28B amount is pretty large.  And, the forward DEFICIT projections point to a DEFICIT about half this year's amount in about 3 years.  Hopefully that trend will be maintained in Trudeau's 2nd term.

In the US and Europe, the harm done to women may not equal the harm done to those who are not white, harm that comes to them because of their skin tone. But the harm exists. The RCC sets the example for all christianity - and the example it sets is that treating women as second-class is OK.  I too left the RCC, and now attend an Episcopal church, one with a female priest, as well as a male priest. There I see true complementarity in the church, in the liturgy, in the homilies, the living example of what God tells us is God's nature - God made them male AND female in GOD'S image.

The fans can see it, other teams can smell it and teammates, like Tucker, sense it, and don't see the organisation making a move - so on to Houston - at least they want to try and get better.\n\n*btw: I do not like Civil !",

Another example of other fleets having a higher bycatch rate would be last year about 30 rockfish species, which includes yellow eye rockfish, became prohibited from retention after too many got caught by fixed gear vessels and had to be discarded at a nearly 100% mortality rate. No one wants to see fisheries overfished, thats not a good deal. Alaska fisheries both state & federal are regarded as well managed and sustainable fisheries that have taken some lessons learned from other fisheries such as Atlantic cod. That fishery judged biomass based off of catch rates. As boats became more efficient at catching cod they calculated the biomass getting bigger n fished it down to an unsustainable rate.

How quaint....\nNow we seem stuck in an rut when it comes to oil, oil revenue and oil influence on our government. Our last governor's only \"achievement\" in office was the massive oil taxation break and it took him three tries and actual oil company employees in elected office to pull it off. It didn't pass the stink test but we live with it today.\nThe truth is we need to diversify our economy so that no one industry can dominate our affairs. Duh.... We are the richest state in the nation based on money in our \"rainy day account\" despite what people are telling you about our financial status. We just need to invest in ourselves rather than in massive oil company stock portfolios. Will any candidates work on that?",

Oil companies are very influential and obviously have a lot to gain by continuing to tap their resources and infrastructure. But dumping all that carbon into the atmosphere is already having dire consequences. They've known this since the 60s. The harm isn't just from cars either.\n\nI think we're at the point where consumers get it. But Trump being such a hard-liner on \"jobs\" thinks this is a boon for the economy. He basically just put the pressure on consumers to change their habits rather than industry gradually changing their habits over time. Even companies like Exxon Mobile understand the future is in sustainable energy. It's hard for me to see us going in the opposite direction - but this doesn't help.",

You and your Funance Committee have been at the helm of the foolishness which caused this \"Crisis\". Right Mr. Neuman? You voted to take the PFD on top of all the spending you have voted for. You spent all the cash then you make it your neighbors problem by wanting their pfd. Back when the pfd was first conceived, there was a deal. The Legislature gets 75% and the people get 25%.

For thousands of years parents picked their childrens' mates, and with good reason: they know their children, they know marriage, and they know human nature better than their children.  And most married people will tell you that feelings figure very little into how they manage their marriage and their lives.

To get the most of any system you 'elevate the bottleneck', you make sure there is never a gap feeding it and it is never blocked on the far side.  In their model the bottleneck never sees any gap in cars.\n\nTheir analysis holds true IF the rate of movement through a bottleneck is fixed.  However, traffic doesn't work like that.  A cross section of road can handle the same volume of cars moving at different rates IF the space between the cars is also different.  i.e. bigger gap & faster cars or smaller gap and slower cars...

Why are highrises okay for rich people but not struggling familes?\n\nSo, why were you talking about 3 story walk ups and high rises being unsuitable for TOD?

Old people are, with some exceptions, more comfortable with their TV remote than with a computer, so they accept what they're spoon fed by Fox. \n\nThere's a cultural problem, shown in the ire directed at the economist  leaving the state and the PF managers who leave: the belief that other people don't deserve to be paid what the market commands everywhere else, call them \"disloyal\" for leaving, and other comments that bring to mind that story about the crabs in the pot pulling each other back in to the boiling water.  \n\nThese problems + low information voters = what we have.",

That means the Catholic University CANNOT be promoting, supporting or engaged in activities which undermine the established teachings of the church on Faith and Morals.   Consider the hot button of Homosexuality.  The University could have some sort of campus ministry to people who have a homosexual inclination, so that they can understand the Church's clear teachings, and learn to integrate the teachings of the church into their lives.  This ministry to homosexuals could NOT promote homosexual marriage, or an active homosexual lifestyle.  Conversely,   If there were a Business Club on Campus, it would have to absolutely reject the exploitation of peoples at the altar of profit.   So a true Catholic university does NOT fit into 'Liberal' or 'Conservative' camps, but promotes all the truths of the faith, regardless of political alignment.",
