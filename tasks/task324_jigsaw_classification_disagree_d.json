I want to take the time to explain the mission of my show so you have a little more clarification. MANTASTIC NW is a select group of Portland based artists who celebrate the male form and body acceptance through visual art. As a collective of artists, our goal is to enrich the lives of people with our art and events. We are of the belief that art has a disproportionate amount of female figures compared to men, especially in nude forms. We are influenced by cultures that shame men for being bald, fat or hairy. We are also told that our genitals are shameful or inadequate. Mantastic NW is a group art show that wants to celebrate the male form and raise awareness of this gender bias within the art community and body shaming within the queer community. We are hoping to expand this show to women, POC and transgendered people who create male form art.",

About the same time India was terribly torn apart into three Religious Apartheid states with huge losss of life and millions of refugees. The latter were within a reasonable time settled decently. Pity the Muslim brothers (with millions of spare land as well as Billions of cash) have not done the same with their fellow Palestinians. To keep people in refugee camps when there is much land and plenty Petro Bucks is a crime against humanity. Check the amazing luxury (justified) that millons of Muslims pilgrims enjoy when visiting Mecca. Can't a fraction of this wealth/organising power be used to settle Palestinians decently in Lebanon/Jordan.

That is a major disqualifier for Catholics, of much greater importance than her position on the environment or immigration.  She lied to congress.   She tampered with evidence.  She made back room deals, not to pass a political agenda but to commit crimes.  She left Americans to die in foreign countries.  She stole money with her so-called \"charitable foundation\".

There are well over 1,200 canon lawyers, both men and women, in the Canon Law Society of America, alone!!! And thousands elsewhere. And you can't convince at least 50 peers -- or even 30 -- to come up with a letter addressed to the pope about this issue? A few years ago, I remember a group of Catholic historians and theologians got together and penned a letter to Pope Benedict, asking him, pleading with him not to promote the canonization of Pope Pius XII.

It was a wonderful experience, because it taught me so much about the First Nations. I then went to live in China where I taught for twenty years. Having experienced life in another culture, I was able to adapt to life in the Middle Kingdom. Twenty years later, when I returned to Canada, a different Canada than the one I had left, I moved to an area where there are at least 12 reserves.  I have come full circle, and still my love of the First Nations has not changed.

The push is to split Mr. McConnell’s current BHCA bill into two bills.  One to reintroduce and vote on the same ACA repeal bill Congress passed in 2015, which was vetoed by Mr. Obama.  Once repealed then you and your liberal constituents can slobber all over the second bill for expanded Medicare expenditures robbing middle-class taxpayers.",

However, artists will only be compensated to a level of their popularity.  As an artist, you make choices as to what you choose to create.  If your product is one which is desirable, compensation for it comes quickly & naturally.  If the product you create has a limited market, compensation can only reach as far as a target group who care for it.  YouTube has allowed many people with no access to professional channels to become quite wealthy by creating content which people want to view.  I believe in the cases where an artist stays true to the art they want to make, they must accept it may not be appreciated by the masses, and therefore not be profitable.",

It became an issue during the primary in response to questions from citizens. It is not necessary to wait for a complete report from the TLAC group.

Because I seem to remember Jesus actively pushing the disciples to spread the good news to Gentiles as well as Jews.  He pissed off the Pharisees BECAUSE (in part) he broke class, race, and nationality distinctions in order to heal, encourage, and teach equally.  He associated with unclean people, including the diseased, including the most despised Samaritans, including the oppressive Romans.  And he pushed his disciples to do the same.\n\nI am very much of the opinion that HOW we strive for equality is more important than simply engaging in that struggle, and I will even concede that people with the laudable goal of promoting equality have occasionally done so in a detrimental manner.\n\nBut I cannot agree, even through silence, with the characterization of even those people or their goals as 'satanic'.

They work best for one spouse who has very high income and other spouse does not work so future withdrawals will be done at lower marginal tax rate.  \n\nTFSA in my opinion should be preferred method of retirement savings for most middle income earners.  However don't spend it for a kitchen upgrade.  If you can save more than TFSA allows, some amount in RRSP should not be a problem.\n\nMost do not think about withdrawal strategy.

Odd, then, that so many people are clamouring to come to western Europe and North America.  There is little doubt that the reason for this is the culture and political systems of the West.  We don't hear too much about anti-racism efforts in the rest of the world.  Could it be because no other part of the world is trying so hard to eradicate that scourge?  \n\nI agree that the history of the West is littered with examples of appallingly racist actions, including Canada.  This makes the West no different than any others.  What makes the West different is the attempt to make amends.  You might balance your trashing of the West with recognising that.",

Erdogan's consolidation of power from within was itself a panic response to an attempt by Turkey's military to once again block what it viewed as a threat to that country's secular beachhead in a sea of radical non-secularism. \n\nFew Western democrats saw it coming but Alex de Tocqueville foresaw it a150 years ago.

At first glance, you’d think it is just another crucified on a cross with a Mary alongside.  But look closely and you see she has her hands raised up and in her hands is a chalice or tall cup of some sort to catch the Holy Blood that spurts from Jesus’ right side.

Although I believe Mr. Scheer is a Roman Catholic, his leadership victory appears to have given the Libs a very loud dog-whistle to sound against the Christian right.

Secondly, science relies mostly on inductive and abductive reasoning, and as such, \"the unknowns\" are not known, and this is why facts can be revised over time. While the components of a model may proven, the logical entailments between them can be lacking. Also, the peer review process may have been at one time what Mr. Box describes, but that is no longer the case, there is a lot of inducement in the current enterprise of science to lead scientists to collude.

They do this to expose themselves to the masses in an effort to sell papers and make money rather than report honestly to the citizens they reach. The only thing in vaping liquid that is derived from tobacco, and it is not the case 100 percent of the time with the availability of synthetic and other sources of nicotine, is the nicotine. Do you propose to place a tax on eggplants, potatoes and tomatoes since they also contain nicotine? The problem here is money. Less people are now smoking which means the state gets less money from the tobacco settlement and the state was so greedy to have its money that it sold bonds they now can't afford to pay.",

The preponderance of the research shows marijuana consumption is NOT a significant cause of auto accidents. In 2015, the Drug and Alcohol Crash Risk report, produced by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, found that while drunken driving dramatically increased the risk of getting into an accident, there was no evidence that using marijuana heightened that risk. \n\nIn fact, after adjusting for age, gender, race and alcohol use, the report found that drivers who had recently consumed marijuana were no more likely to crash than drivers who were not intoxicated at all.",

The umpire may not be able to fly as it may aggravate a potential tear.

He argues for a secular space where we are able to meditate on our smallness and avert the sense that we are the psychological center of all things and the masters of our destinies. De Botton laments the tendency of modern life to trample on the rhythms of the earth, to deny death and shy away from the harsh edges of reality.\"\n\nNon-believers can learn a lot from religion, without having to give up atheism.",

We won't have those aircraft.\n\nThe Saab Gripen E is a new design (not in production) that is also a multi-role aircraft, but its emphasis is on air superiority, reconnaissance, and the strike.

At this time, who in their right mind would enter into any contract for future payments from Alaska?",

I agree 100% with her on this issue but am a long standing conservative voter. Hell, you even have Patrick Brown writing Justin Trudeau a letter saying he supports a carbon tax. \nThe rest of this noise about Nazis, alt right, BLM etc is just fodder for the media and the trolls who love to come on these forums and spout off their nonsense.",

In that position I had the job of reviewing plans and specifications from jobs all over the country.

In technical presentations to large customers one of the key selling points was those tax credits. Those projects kept our company running and the installations provided jobs for all of the trades I noted previously. Workers are customers. It also provided lower electrical usage and, hence, lower costs for  buildings.\n\nSo, when conservative politicians and pundits whined about the ARRA not creating a single job, I knew they were lying.

As for giving, I looked at the time voluteers spend cleaning up, along the rivers, parks, when a area is put aside for the homeless to set up camp, what is wrong with helping clean these areas for have a place to set up camp.

We can argue all day just what makes this girl behave this way, but one thing's for sure: It isn't because she's using her mother as a guinea pig. Enough of this \"testing\" nonsense. In life, there is cause and effect. The mother conveniently leaves out a possible cause. For all we know, Mama has been instrumental in driving away every single boyfriend the daughter has ever had. For all we know, Mama used to beat her when she was young or constantly denigrate her--and maybe she's finally getting hers.",

The bus swerved to avoid a rider on his bike that I never saw, riding on the edge of the road. There were bike lanes/sidewalks on both sides of the road. The rider got mad at the bus and flipped the finger at the bus. The rider obviously had no idea how bad his actions could have been.

Is about police not dismissing claims from the outset (as they have had a general propensity to do) and believing that a complaint \"may\" have merit at the outset.  This is not bias.  It only becomes bias if the belief that it may have merit prejudices the investigation.  My point (which I thought was pretty clear) is that a good investigator is required to conduct a neutral investigation and follow the evidence...regardless of what that evidence shows.\n\nIt is true that the system needs to make sure that investigators are neutral, and that decisions are made on evidence, regardless of whether it is inculpatory or exculpatory.  This is the investigator's job, and this whole issue surrounds the question about whether they are doing this and about whether they are properly trained.",

With the Broncos stacking the box they had Dez in single coverage many times, and the Cowboys never recognized and took advantage of that. Dak wasn't running for his life in the first half, they had time for deeper routes to develop.

Jackie wore on stage slightly feminine looking clothing -pants,not skirts or dresses,&had a somewhat feminine looking hair-do,& some makeup. Jackie the singer was known as an effeminate MAN, not transgendered. Only later, when investigators tracked Jackie down years after retiring from show biz  were there reports of supposedly \"living as a woman\" with her aunt.  The article  keeps referring to Jackie as \"transgendered\" but doesn't present any quotes from the 30 hours of recent interviews with Jackie that show Jackie considers Jackie transgendered. Maybe Jackie considers HIMself a gay male transvestite,not a transsexual woman. Since \"trans-chic's\" fashionable nowadays in the media,maybe the article's writer was tempted to too hastily toss Jackie into  the \"trans\" camp. But what does JACKIE say?",

Religious intolerance in America began with the arrival of the so-called Puritans, and has continued unabated to the present day.  In most cases, the driving force behind the pervasive religious intolerance that consistently characterises U.S. history is the so-called 'Christian right' in American that often takes its cue from xenophobic groups like the KKK.

In fact, the city administration, HART, and (now, apparently) the developers and unions seem afraid to utter the term “maglev,” which is a different rail technology. I wonder if Mr. Carr is aware that a new funding plan that would provide over $9 billion, which the mayor claims is not enough to complete the 20-mile plan, would easily accommodate a maglev plan for extended rail service to UH-Manoa, Waikiki, and West Kapolei (and even accommodate a spur into Central O’ahu). This project must not move forward blindly; it needs a pause, a comprehensive audit, and a full and fair evaluation of ALL alternatives for its “rescue.”",

It is in America's best interest to be friends with Russia.  Through friendship we can influence them more than through enmity.  Regarding influencing American opinion, come on, every foreign country especially ones like Israel do everything they can to influence American opinion and politics.  Even if the Russians did overtly attempt to influence the election, there is nothing new or out of the ordinary.  The Russians only disclosed true facts, which neuters any complaints that might be based on deception.  If we trust in democracy then we must support disclosure of true facts so that citizens can make the most informed decisions regardless of where the facts come from.",

How sad to see Americans bishops discard Jesus' Gospel for Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, and Paul Ryan.

Compare that with a MF F series who's starting point is around 90-100bps then add on the commission of 1.5% to 1.8% and the cost is much higher compared to a MF with with embedded comp of just 1%  so the math does not work hence why they sell ETF's and one of the major reasons (at least on the advice side) that they have taken off.",

More importantly, in Colorado, any type of \"injury\" including an emotional injury can be levied against the liable party.\n To say that \"Not seeking punitive damages, so the likelihood of a big payday is slim. Compensatory damages would be medical expenses and maybe lost wages if she missed any work. If she suffered permanent damage there could be damages for the disability\" is entirely inaccurate, as the majority of the damages, comprising a large payday being sought, would fall in to the category of emotional injury.",

And if they did, it was like a slap on the hand hard if at all. The ALL Liberals of Hollywood succumbed to Harveys advances without calling the Authorities and MORE Women paid the price for their fame and glory. lol, they got what they wanted, nothin more than prostitution in my books.

Rather he is describing their awareness of being saved while they were dead in sin (Eph 2:5) and the experience of life as a result.\"\n\nAnd of course, Bill, this is where to totally disagree. When Paul says \"not of ourselves\" he means not of ourselves outside Christ like we are born. Paul never negates the human factor in salvation and always presents what a believer can do in Christ. Paul is writing especially to Jews who think they can be saved without Christ but it also has an application to the Gentiles as well.\n\nThe sinner can \"save himself\" by the way he responds to the gospel under the influence and power of the Holy Spirit.

We need to consider whether we are willing to accept a North Korea with a robust nuclear arsenal - with the ability to strike at targets in North America.  We either need to accept this, or we need to attack North Korea, with the goal of removing their nuclear production and nuclear research capabilities.\n\nOf course, that also leads to problem of how China would react to such an attack.  By far the best outcome would be for China to realize that the West will not tolerate such an unstable nuclear armed state, and for them to act to prevent the nuclear buildup in North Korea.\n\nI wonder if this is being quietly encouraged by China, as a test of the resolve of the West.",

The Charter and who didn't act, all three PM's didn't , are not the issue, although even Trudeau has changed his stance from the original justification. The key issue here is the belief or rather the government's stance that they felt they couldn't win. What else are they going to say ? Knowing this government it is highly unlikely they were ever going to fight this case. The point is we will never know, as the deal is secret, and we will never know what the lawyers advised because they will have been sworn to secrecy. So it becomes a face value issue. You believe they should have settled, fair enough as I said, however it should be just as fair for people to have an opposing view, without all the accusations that they are ignorant or anti-Charter. Everytime there is a settlement, we can disagree with the amount, without being against the law",

Rather than criticizing Trudeau for not actively seeking an improved trade deal, the mainstream media has lavished praise on him for not goading Trump.

The al-Nusrah group that controls Idlib is known to have chemical weapons, including sarin. The UN has accused them of using it more than once during the war. If the Syrian jets targeted an al-Nusrah weapons cache containing the sarin, it could be dispersed widely enough to kill civilians.",

Symantec was founded as a US company in the Silicon Valley back in the 1980's, just like Veritas was.   No doubt someday the Springfield Symantec employees will share this fate too.\n\nAnd here high tech was supposedly going to be the savior of our economy, both nationally and here locally.

The US attacked a factory in Khartoum and caves in Afghanistan. Then 9/11. The US attacked Afghanistan. Then Iraq. Arabs attacked London, Paris, Madrid, all in countries which had attacked Arabs. Then Germany, France, Canada. So this attack in the UK was just another battle in a continuing war. \n\nOne side or other must stop if there is to be peace. Since the West started it by taking land from Arabs, it would make sense if the west stopped. Pull troops out of the Muslim countries. The west has nothing to lose, and the possibility of peace.

The mothers I meet on the playground are seeing the patience I have with my kids and they are learning to be patient too.

Furthermore, do journalist possess so much superiority that they feel they must tell readers what to think? Should not readers be allowed room to think for themselves? What about the poor grammar? And...is Trump and scantily dressed women the only topics internet news can muster? You would think the feminists of today would be up in arms about the current objectification of women.

The Liberals had the weighted ballot in mind for reform.  The Conservatives, under that system would  have a difficult time forming even a minority gov't.  Under FPTP, the Conservatives command a solid 30% and only need to sway another 9% to command a gov't.  They had no hope under the weighted ballot and so started the demand for a referendum  That would muddy the water beyond recognition.  The NDP and Greens wanted full proportional representation.  This would allow them more seats and would always hold the balance of power.  Beware, these parties would be appointing unelectable and unelected party hacks to sit in the HOC and waggle the gov't's body.  Trudeau was willing to give them a weighted ballot and would have allowed them greater amount of MPs without campaigning.  But that wasn't good enough for them so they voted with the Cons.  Alors, no reform!!",

Responsibility for pedestrian safety starts first with drivers, who need to slow down, consciously look for pedestrians, obey the laws and quit rushing.

Banning the use of cellphones while crossing city and state streets would certainly help.  As for intersection design, that is more of a science than an art.  Both the cities and state follow the Uniform Manual on Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), a federal guideline which specifies when certain treatments (such as no turning movements and Barnes Dances) should be used.  Research on Barnes Dances shows they work incredibly well in some locations and horribly in others.  Cities have removed Barnes Dances where the impact on traffic congestion was severe and unjustified by pedestrian counts.   I urge the city to continue its safe pedestrian movement.",

Law enforcement for the most part didn't even consider dui, unless a crash occurred. Now the LE is more educated on drug recognition, and now doing their job.

Is this because more people are driving altered or better recognition of what exhibits a person under the influences of altered substances besides alcohol. Take Alcohol's history, there are far more arrests these days, than 50 years ago. Is that training, ability to test, etc or more drunks on the road?",

The schools are already told that they must be parents 24/7 when parents don't.  They are supposed to provide food healthier than  parents provide, they are supposed to monitor students emotional and physical well-being, they are supposed to develop and provide culturally sensitive classes which meet liberal views of how the world should be as opposed to how it is, they are day care centers in fact; they are required to do everything except provide education that will result in the 'students' being able to succeed after graduation either at a university or in gainful employment.  That cannot be done by today's 'educators', even though it was accomplished by many 'teachers' within my lifetime.   Little wonder, when they are required to spend so much of their time doing everything else.",

Make it easier to see inventory.

I have purchased on line as well when it was a item you can only custom order.  But I have also used B& H in the USA, and the camera manufacturers own web sites.\n\nOut of all of them, I would say B&H has the most professional website.  Easy to see 100 items at once, easy to read customer reviews.  I have ordered at 11pm on a Sunday and item at my house Wednesday afternoon. Impressive logistics.\n\nI actually prefer Henrys because they are the closest to my house and they have good hours and good sales staff, but if you want to compete on line, get a better website.",

Livestock in the United States consume 7 times as much grain as is consumed by the entire U.S. human population and the grains fed to livestock could feed 840 million humans who had a plant-based diet.
