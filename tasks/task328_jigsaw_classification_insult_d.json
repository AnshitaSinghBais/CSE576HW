He just kept on coming...and the weather as well. Then it hit. Hailed so hard I had to stand over my pack dog to shield her from the slashing, wind-driven deluge. Thunder and lightning as well. Didn't last long. I glassed to see how the redheaded fellow in the tank top was doing. The hail was just getting to his position. Hasty retreat would describe his actions.

They all feed on each other, and fight together to ward off anyone who wants to intervene and invade their turf, and disrupt their mutually beneficial and highly lucrative cabal.\n\nKen Buck's book \"Drain the Swamp\" spells out how it works.  To get a committee chair, you have to pay the RNC or the DNC $500k/yr; $250k/yr to get a seat on the committee.  You get it back in campaingn funding for your next re-election, as long as you tow the party line.  If you don't, you're stripped of your seat, you get zero funding, and they'll spend your money to fund a primary opponent.  Both parties do it.  Bi-partisan voting isn't allowed on key issues.",

The amount of their retirement is based on 50% of their high 3 years averaged. With all that overtime they can double or very significantly increase the amount of their retirement checks. So say a cop goes to the academy at age 21. Then games the overtime the last 3 of 20 years. Now he can retire with conceivably $10,000.00 per month plus free medical for his family for life. He starts collecting at age 41. And you claim it costs the taxpayer no more for a newbie cop that has no pension at all. Somewhat disingenuous of you Patrick.

The snake eating it's own tail.  I guess they figure on moving off-planet?  Now would be good.",

Beckel made that comment in a Fox news interview in 2010 - around the time wikileaks was publishing State Department cables leaked by Bradley Manning.  Contrary to your assertion, he was not then (and apparently isn't now) a \"Clinton strategist\".  From the context of his remarks it appears he was saying that the U.S. government ought to illegally assassinate Assange, not that some random gunman ought to off him.  Personally I think it was a highly irresponsible remark on his part, but in case you have some difficulty parsing the difference, Beckel was a talking head TV commentator (who subsequently went to work for Fox news) who spouted off something irresponsible, while Trump is a mainstream party presidential candidate who routinely spouts off irresponsible comments in his campaign rallies.

In most of the rankings Japan generally is placed seventh in the world for the size of its military.\n\nPeople also seem to forget that Japan's constitution was imposed on it by the US and that America has, at least until Trump, considered it to be to its advantage to have Japan dependent on the US for its nuclear deterrent.\n\nTrump would also have you believe that the Japanese are getting a free ride.

As a long time Independent, he decided to run on the Dem ticket so that the movement for fundamental changes could be taken all the way to the convention. Have any Independents had any media coverage in this election? Without the obvious collusion and cheating that took place, I believe he would be the candidate. He said from the beginning that it was more important to get the message into the convention than it was for him to be president. If he had run as an Independent, the media could have just thrown the shovel away. As it turned out, the media blackout of his impressive campaign left an ever bigger message to the American people.

The key issue here is the belief or rather the government's stance that they felt they couldn't win. What else are they going to say ? Knowing this government it is highly unlikely they were ever going to fight this case. The point is we will never know, as the deal is secret, and we will never know what the lawyers advised because they will have been sworn to secrecy. So it becomes a face value issue. You believe they should have settled, fair enough as I said, however it should be just as fair for people to have an opposing view, without all the accusations that they are ignorant or anti-Charter.

Guy down the street killed his wife and himself, probably because his 10 year old kid was out at 1 am egging peoples houses and his 17 year old kid was having parties every night and the guests would leave the party at 2 am and throw trash  bags of empty beer cans in everyone's yard.  It doesn't matter how ritzy it looks, if trash lives there, they act like trash.  And they elect trash quite often as their local gubmint.",

The nation of Canada was created by the British and French upon a substrate, hundreds of years ago, that consisted of native tribes with no writing and no cities and no books and where the common way for adults to die was to be slaughtered by age 30 by a rival tribe warrior. \n\nSorry, Sherry, THERE IS NO CANADA without actions of the British and French. Look, if you want to be honest, you can say that the established tribal, illiterate landscape of this land mass of hundreds of years ago was demolished by the British and French. But you make no sense when you pretend they destroyed Canada. They created it.",

Frequently, they don't see themselves as poor even when they actually are. Rather they view themselves as temporarily \"down on their luck\" and look up to the rich (Trump-like figures) as role models even though in reality they have almost no chance of emulating them, their lifestyles or wealth especially in the absence of an education. The white lower middle class men (especially) seem to view educated women (like Hillary Clinton or professional women) with disdain. \nClass isn't as cogent in America not because of elitism in academia (which of course exists) but rather because Americans eschew class comparisons and the very idea of equality.",

Then one would expect high cost when one is getting the best service. \n\nSo if Canada went for private sector health care, we could expect top service and about 17% of the population requiring help. That sounds pretty reasonable. And the constant bickering over health care cost would cease.\n\nOne other point. The private sector provides virtually all our needs and wants except health care. I cannot accept that health care in the private sector would be any different than other services. If it is more costly, so be it. You gets what you pay for.  Canada is a wealthy country.",

One is that most Christians aren't proactively involved in the pro-life movement (to their shame), and for those who are, they already have their hands full dealing with actual abortion clinics, Planned Parenthood, and the like. Secondarily, there is emotionally a much greater degree of separation in dealing with a fertilized egg sitting in a tube that is never going to develop beyond a handful of days unless it has the further human intervention of being implanted.

Within 3 months, he colluded with Harper, flooded the PC Party with Reformers who outvoted the Tories and merged the 2 Parties, voting for everything the Harper Reformers wanted. This included they new name, which had 'conservative' in it, so many PCs would be fooled into thinking it was their same Party.\nSome life long Tories still don't know the facts of the story - of the creation of the CPC by lies, deceit and betrayal.

Fortunately not all Commissions are like that and the Australian Royal Commission is a very good example. It is obvious from some of the comments made by the Commissioners that substantial changes to canon law and practice are going to be recommended. One would have thought that the clever thing to have done was to make the changes before we see another example of secular society dragging the Church into the realities of the modern world.

Can't they SEE their vehicle is drifting over & correct this in time? Or is their brain so defective that they can't process the situation fast enough? Or are 100 percent of these idiots in a deep sleep or drunk? I've driven while drowsy and NEVER drifted. Never been drunk, either.",

The media did not inform on that just as it did not mention the low percentage of Americans without health insurance.  Since the private sector does so well in providing virtually all our needs at reasonable cost, I cannot accept that health care would be different.     \n\nA big advantage of the private sector is that the individual can select the insurance plan and thus the cost that the individual wants. No one size fits all. The cost of health care for the country is  irrelevant unless who is included is stated. \n\nThe private sector works.",

To my mind, insofar as religion is a part of this massive rift in the body politic, it has mostly to do with the tendency most of us have to form our religious views based on our politics and not the other way around.\n\nThe road less traveled -- far less -- is to allow the Gospel to transform our world view. But that isn't so simple since the Gospel can't be neatly stuffed into either a \"liberal\" or a \"conservative\" playbook. \n\nI think one of the great temptations for religious people is to fall into the trap of interpreting faith through the lens of ideology rather than personal conversion. When that happens, it becomes all too easy to use religion as a weapon for beating others into submission rather than as a light for individual illumination.",

That doesn't mean that it is out to make sure all men have a better quality of life than women. In fact, it often treats men, particularly working class men, as expendable.

The ancient Hawaiian \"walls\" on Kauai are terraces for runoff retention. The Albizia that was shipped in from Australia was loaded with bugs and fungus. Hawaii doesn't need any more parasites or fungus. The best and cheapest thing to do is spike the tree, the toxin is retained in the tree and isn't harmful in the ground. After that, cut off the larger branches as soon as the tree dies, then cut down the trunk when it dies. There are spiked trees in Hilo, just look up by Komohauna, somebody spiked those, although they're being bulldozed down for development.

It doesn't get rid of a market economy - but it does have social assistance to ensure a minimum standard of living, strong regulation to prevent the rich from literally murdering millions of the poor (as they do with extreme alacrity when unchecked).\nWhat exact form it takes though is not set in stone, I think local conditions should alter the specifics. The social democracies of Western Europe are good, Canada and New Zeeland are good. But so is Argentina where 80% of the population is employed in worker-owned co-ops that are democratically managed. \n\nUltimately -I want empirically tested results, I want a world without poverty, without hunger, without homelessness.

After a “super PAC” aligned with Mr. Trump started an ad campaign against Senator Dean Heller of Nevada when he said he opposed the bill, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to complain that the attacks were “beyond stupid,” according to two Republicans with knowledge of the tense exchange.\"",

The courts ruled that they could \"borrow\" it and they creatively did. In addition and similar to the currently mandated \"Colorado Enterprise Fund\" for PERA (Google this as well), there was an internal directive to force PERA to invest in local Colorado companies such as Level3, Qwest, etc. then soon after Colorado entered a business cycle correction as well as the dot com bust.

The Guptas are by far the most brazen of the lot so far, but to look back on the Mbeki or even Mandela eras with rose-tinted glasses I think would equally be ill-advised. The rot set in years and years ago. Sadly the ANC has never been about clean governance. Of course that doesn't take away from the abject scandal of our current failed state, but it did serve to remind me that our 'stalwarts' and 'constitutionalists' have as much of a case to answer as the thieves and Zupta acolytes of today.

If the tourist industry is willing to help fund a new route the state may be able to address this issue much, much sooner. For now and as it stands, those of us participating in this thread will not be around to see it happen.",

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

Muslims consider all non-Muslims and non-Muslim culture useless and see their goal to make the whole world Muslim. Everything before Islam is jahiliyya or ignorance, of no value and should be destroyed.   Under Islam, non-Muslims must pay a large tax.

This situation appears to be a function of the assessment system whereby in an overheated housing market the assessed valuations for other forms of commercial and residential property use are rising faster than the assessed valuations for dedicated rental housing properties. However, there's been a particularly problematic rise in low-rise commercial assessments, resulting in tax increases in the range of 200 to 400 percent as I understand it, in some areas in downtown Toronto, which has become a contentious political issue resulting in a \"tax revolt\" by some commercial property owners.",

At the time I remember buying and freezing as much cheese as we could fit into the freezer of our RV. Cheese was less than half the price we were paying in B.C., and this was with the dollar at par. \n\nI remember milk prices being attractive, but I can’t remember how much so.

If there is a sin among the white folks, it is their inability to understand why blacks lagged so far behind despite of all the help they been getting for the past 50 years. It should be a concern that both Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans are looking toward whites as their bench mark.

The one is to those who are still tempted to look the other way.  Those in power cannot be allowed to look the other way, so sacking a few would be a good message to send.

As example look at the Cruise ships and the hundreds of cruise ship operated motor coaches operating in the State.  The cruise industry claims over a million visitors to Alaska each year, so 1,000,000. X $2500.(ave tour not the shipboard charges) =$2,500,000,000 X .03% sales tax =$75,000,000.00  This is a good starting point, but the foreign owned cruise industry will lobby against it, regardless we need to consider this as non impacting taxation to Alaska residents who all ready have been hit with extreme property tax increases.  It is time to accurately define those companies benefiting unfairly and levy fair taxes upon them before sucking the blood out of Alaska residents, anything less would hardly be acceptable.",

One thing is clear, if Le Pen is not elected, and the same thing happens again - as it inevitably will - then the french voters too worried of \"cryptofascism\" to vote for Le Pen should light their candles, hold up their placards, brandish their pens and shut up.",

It seems for less money we could make the road a bit safer.  We just returned from UK and did extensive driving there - they use cameras - when you approach an area with camera surveillance there is a notification sign letting drivers know and if you have a gps in your car it notifies you and posts the speed limit.  We were told the cameras work well and tickets are issued and that it frees up law enforcement for more important issues.    As for another gravel quarry, our state is becoming ever increasingly a tourist destination and the Seward Hwy drive is considered one of the most beautiful in the world.

That Mexico should be asked to pay for this is only logical. Why can't those Mexicans understand?

Instead, as Robin so deftly pointed out, the arrangement is exactly the opposite of what it should be; the oil companies are giving us a \"small cut\" of our oil and keeping the rest for themselves. It makes us look \"PRETTY STUPID\" and that stupidity is not lost on the oil companies. We are basically GUARANTEEING the oil companies survival while at the same GUARANTEEING our bankruptcy.

They simply decided the matter by plebiscite, which is not a sufficient process for balancing of charter rights, and so their decision was voided.  The BC courts, consequently, had the authority to supplant their own charter analysis.\n\nAs you pointed out a while back, Alceste, it may well be that the SCC will agree with both the BC and Ontario courts.

Now regarding the market issue brought up by Mr. Boggs, I do find it quite persuasive except perhaps in very large companies where gender issues are put under a microscope by government agencies and such.  In smaller companies, employers would be crazy to hire a man at a higher rate than a woman of equal quality would demand.

Come up with an idea and start a business that actually makes a profit. Have your spouse support you and your family while you work 90 hours/week to get things rolling. Re-mortgage your house and liquidate your savings to start the business. Sign a business lease and come up with the rent money. Make sure your employees get paid before you get paid. Cover benefits yourself for you and your family. Pay double the CPP contributions. \n    Are you interested? Hmmmmm....I thought not.

It seems that the airline then tried to get her on the next flight to Halifax but that when she boarded they did not have seats together available for her and her three children.She then apparently opted to deplane (which would have resulted in a delay for all the other passengers while her bags were taken off) and to fly the next day when Air Canada could provide her with adjoining seats.\nNow she is suing the airline presumably on the grounds that they did not provide a service up to the standard of her expectations.  \nI pity the poor people at Air Canada who have to put up with so many entitled fools.",

But in any case it is doubtful that there will be earth shattering revelations of  gross misconduct by anybody involved in previous investigations.\n\nThe truly fundamental and root cause that needs airing is the dysfunctional remote reserve culture that induces FN women and girls to abandon their home environment and expose themselves to the risks inherent in entering an urban experience they are not prepared for. \n\nThat does not in any way absolve anybody - but is absolutely necessary to evolve a policy and strategy of advancement and integration into modern society.

They should certainly rerun and update those, but what I remember from them is that Iraq pays BP $2 a barrel for a gallon of oil pumped from their Ramadi field. That's their production credit. They then get paid a percentage of what the barrel sells for. The State of Alaska at the time of those articles was (I believe) paying $56 a barrel for BP to pump our Prudhoe Bay oil. I could be off by a few dollars, but either way, we're pay substantially more for our production credits than Iraq. Our oil is heavier and requires more processing and it's in a cold region, but Iraq is a war zone that's hotter than heck, so I'm really not sure why we're paying so much ... I suspect it has something to do with silver crossing palms and the State of Alaska's inability to grasp that it is a resource-development company that ought to have at least as much business sense as a Texas landowner.",

Then some appeal court judges (who are part of the original body of jurisprudence rulings) decides to set a new interpretation that overturn decades of what appears to be settled law. This gum up the system with a raft of new cases.\n\nAlso, are you aware that entered orders are appealable? And the opposing party can refuse to sign it even after a judge has decided. This means you have to file an appeal. Crazy. Stupid crazy.",

It was passed by way of a \"Congressional-Executive Agreement\".  First the treaty must be introduced to Congress like a bill, then just be passed by over 50% plus one vote in both the House and the Senate. Then it must be signed by the President.\nThe NAFTA treaty was passed with Canada and Mexico during the Clinton Presidency using this method. Which proves its legality.\nSo, you can continue to lie to yourself, but the truth is the truth.\nHowever, the treaty offered to the U.S. by the Republic of Hawaii passed the House by a vote of 209-91, and the Senate by a vote of 42-21 exactly two-thirds vote.\nSo either way the treaty was legally accepted by way of Treaty Method, or by way of Congressional-Executive Agreement method.

Without fluoridated water we don't get the best coverage.  \n\nThe US has fluoridated for over 70 years and nearly 3 out of 4 Americans on public water systems get the benefit. Most of the Western world has water or salt fluoridation, water with already enough fluoride or socialized medicine. Clallam County is a dental professional shortage area. Fluoridation has been gone for a year and the people who took it away have no replacement solution. To be fair, it's because there really isn't one as cost effective - fluoride in water costs about a dollar a year per family member - filling a single cavity costs over a hundred.\n\nSequim could be doing better.

In my opinion, there is a threshold that once crossed will create a new dominant \"species\" that will be able to out perform and more importantly, out think humans at an exponential rate. It will have at its disposal all the knowledge humans have assembled and will use these resources to create new knowledge and technology the likes of which we humans cannot even imagine.\nHow long will it take this new dominant entity to realize that humans are not only messy, inconvenient, expensive, and more significantly, irrelevant, and inimical to its purposes, whatever they may be. The thought that humans can somehow control such an entity is the height of conceit and absurd.",
