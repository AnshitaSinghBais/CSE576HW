Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law. \n\n2.

When posters try to explain you have no time for subtle difference and nuanced arguments. You just label them all ‘liars’.",

In his recent book, THE PROTESTANTS, Alec Ryrie notes that Luther's follower -- owing to their great love of God and Scripture -- embarked (years after Luther's death) upon bloody religious wars, burnings, martyrdom and regicide. And among competing Protestants, every opponent became a papal anti-Christ! lol.\n\nOf course, the fiercest hatred today is silent; it is racial hatred. And that is everywhere. And Muslims -- in second place on the hatred chart -- are seen by many as mini-anti-Christ's for believing their faith is true when it is opposed to everyone's else's truth. Oh what are we to do with all this holiness and self-righteousness! \n\nHatred like a falling axe never loses its weight even in the most innocent, holy hands.",

The country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want. We have been working on becoming \"a more perfect union\" ever since. As we move ever so slowly toward a merit based society, white male privilege is losing power. It is now illegal to kill black people while they are praying in church. That use to be one of the many white privileges that white men had. Lynchings are no longer considered family entertainment. There are photos. White folks invented the \"race card\" when they decided that being white was more important than being human. The good news is that younger people are generally less racist than their elders. In another 200 years, all lives may actually matter in this country.",

Both straight/gay alike who want' to act on sexual tendencies, are, hence, both called to lead celibate chaste lives. The Church specifies deep-seated homosexual behaviors as they differ. When a man sleeps with say a woman, they generally have a child - most often/common. Deep seated homosexual don't result in having to raise a child/children. Since people with preference of same gender cannot have children together. So the Church explicitly points out these actions do not follow from Christ's birth. Nor the necessity of life for Baptism. Also, the function of marriage between one man and one woman. That is why the homosexual act is scandalous, but isn't the worst of them.",

I also looked up because you wouldn't get this from the media. More white people get killed from police then black people. I was stunned when I looked that up. Yes, as a percentage the numbers change but from the media you would think that only black people get killed by cops. The FBI stat I saw was 2100. white people killed and 1150 black people. Over a 5 year time frame. Again, blacks make up less of the population , I get that , but its not like it's 3 white people and 6,000. black people killed by cops.",

Well there's a big, fat, juicy one right there. He changed it at a whim, opening the door for every homophobic, misogynistic, reactionary right wing cleric who felt that their own church wasn't hating homosexuals and women enough.\n\nOn the upside, Benny showed that you can change anything and 2000 years of tradition can be dropped like hot cakes, and I hope that Francis makes full use of the precedent set by him.",

That is why they created \"the one drop rule\" in the first place. Don't take my word for it. Just ask a white cop. Most of them support racial profiling. That alone makes equal protection under the law impossible. Of course, you could ask the white racists that support Trump. That includes the KKK and Nazis. They will tell you the same thing.

Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.\" \n\nLisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.\n\nLisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men.

My favorite part is when he says, \"We wonder how someone's sexual or affectional desires are in any way our business. Yet they are made to be our business.\" His use of \"we\" is so charming. I, also, wonder why it is  his business,  and  question the use of passive voice. \"Made to be our business.\" Indeed. Back in the closet with you all.",

There are Muslim countries like Turkey (which nightclub do you want to celebrate New Year's Eve in?).  I think Islam is a blight.

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

The odds of there being a “gay gene” are practically zero, likely there is no single factor that determines whether a person will be hetero or homosexual. Your silly assertion that people who don’t believe homosexuality is a choice must believe in some here-to-for undiscovered “gay gene” is a classic straw man. As far as your god hypothesis goes there is as much evidence to support your belief in a supernatural being as there is santa clause the tooth fairy and the flying spaghetti monster.

There is no sanctuary, Mosque, elementary school, hospital, it doesn't matter.  Sharia  Law demands that all infidels convert or die. PERIOD.  And  these sicko Muslims think they will go to paradise and get bunch of virgins  if they go and commit suicide while murdering scores of children and even babies.  The last suicide bomber got praise from his sister, having made  it to paradise.  To not be an infidel you have to be Sunni or Shiite; but you have to be in the right place, or you die.

Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.\" \n\nLisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.\n\nLisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.\n\nI use my real name here.",

He is a terrible soldier who caused his country more problems than he solved.

It was after these efforts failed that Klan violence and intimidation escalated and became widespread.[62] Author Andrew Ward, however, writes, \"In the spring of 1867, Forrest and his dragoons launched a campaign of midnight parades; 'ghost' masquerades; and 'whipping' and even 'killing Negro voters and white Republicans, to scare blacks off voting and running for office.\"  He gave Order No. 1 to abolish the KKK but by that time they were spread throughout the US.

The compound collapsed. The US Special forces team, including Speer, then charged into the dust and debris. Bombing in such circumstances would normally disorientate and incapacitate anyone at least temporarily. Khadr and one other man survived. The other man was shot dead in the compound by the assault team but he could have thrown the grenade. Khadr, blinded in one eye, shot twice in the back, survived.

If unanimous verdicts were required, a defendant would benefit from a hung jury with 10 of 12 voting to acquit, because if the prosecutor polled the jury and found that 10 people voted to acquit, he would be unlikely to re-file charges and go to trial again.\nIf a jury votes 10 of 12 to convict a person, it means that the prosecutor has failed to prove his case \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", because the two people voting to acquit had enough reasonable doubt to acquit. Since a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty (beyond a reasonable doubt), a person in this case should still be considered to be innocent. In that case the prosecutor has the option of re-filing the charges and trying the case again.",

That wrath could manifest itself in war, violent retaliation, ending all support, some support, or switching sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict (none of which happened).

There are over 120 verses in the Qur'an that would, and should, be considered hate literature under our current laws. Those verses promote violence against identifiable groups. It is time we stop bending to the insane political correctness that is undermining our society, and start enforcing the laws that are currently on the books. If our anti-hate laws were enforced, the Qur'an would be banned in Canada. If it is not banned then the offending verses should be edited out of ALL Qur'ans in Canada. And check out the surveys that were done in Europe that show that about half of Muslim students believe violence is okay against non-Muslims.",

He lost interest and just threw a roof on top of the unfinished building. After they both passed away, my parents & me kept going up to enjoy it. No running water, basic electricity and a wood stove my dad made. I grew up going there in the summer and even winters. I knew every stone in that area. 13 acres of pristine land on a private lake. It was time for my mother to retire, they were still paying for a mortgage. They ended up selling it over a decade ago, something I agreed to and now majorly regret. I found out just the other day that the new owner tore it down to build a rental cottage on it. Its eating me up.... Really depressing",

If you get your medical insurance through your employer (which is basically what we have here in Hawaii) that is called the \"German system\".

After fighting and arguing with a more senior manager at BCBG, she reluctantly agreed to the exchange for credit only (no returns whatsoever, its not their policy).

How could such a think happen even once in the church, much less so often that the church spends years developing training for them?  There is something so backwards here, so intrinsically terrifying, as to call to question the very nature of the church itself, as currently defined by the bishops.

ABUS is approved by Health Canada for screening purposes, as an addition to mammography. Ms.Weeks neglected to write about why ABUS is beneficial as a supplementary screening tool. For women with dense breast tissue, tumours are sometimes hidden behind dense tissue because both  appear white on a mammogram.  40% of women over age 40- 3 million women in Canada- have dense breasts. ABUS finds small, invasive, node negative cancers. Evidence shows ABUS detects an additional 3.6 cancers per 1000 women screened after mammography (Berg, 2016). ABUS, in addition, to mammography can significantly improve cancer detection for women with dense breasts.  In fact, the Alberta health ministry covers the cost of ABUS for women with the highest level of breast density. By ignoring how ABUS is a beneficial supplementary screen for women with dense breasts, Ms. Weeks failed to provide a complete picture.",

IMO, INTENT is a huge factor in addressing such an action.  The orthodoxy of \"new liberalism\" as represented by the actions of those who condemn Ms Shurtz is, to me, a \"souless,\" narrow-minded , vindictive view which I find very disturbing.  I see it as the \"mirror image\" of the radical social orthodoxy I find so deplorable in the Taliban.  Yes, Ms Shurtz was not physically stoned or put to death, but destroying her career, her academic legacy and her personal and professional life and banishing her from her \"community\" (the University) is a horribly costly punishment.  \n\nSimple question:  Do you feel any harm done to the students of color was in any way comparable to the harm done by those who are destroying Ms Shurtz's academic and personal life?

Some people think the electoral college was a way to award power to Southern slave states, where each slave, though not allowed to vote, counted as 3/5ths a vote in determining the number of electors granted each state.  That arrangement made Virginia, with 350 thousand slaves (840 thousand total population) an electoral powerhouse like California or Florida today.\n\nThese days we don't have slaves, and at least in theory every grown citizen has one vote.

Love is unselfish.\n\nI understand your confusion because sex feels extraordinarily good and evokes emotions in us, e.g., of feeling wanted, of euphoria, of dominance (for some), of openness, etc... that contribute to that good physical feeling.  And when you do it with someone you love, like anything you do with someone you love, it's better.  I think we FEEL LOVED when we have sex, and that's perhaps where the confusion lies.\n\nI'm going to qualify my comment about sex being purely lust driven, and say that it is also need driven.  You think you have sex because you love; I say you have sex because of lust and of feeling loved.  \n\nBut while we can FEEL being loved; that is not the same thing as LOVING someone.  Jesus commands us to LOVE not to REACT to love.  \n\nHomosexual \"love\" is that way; someone makes them feel a certain way and they think it's love, when it's lust or envy.",

One critic of Canada's health care system has stated to the effect: Canada has a Chevrolet system at Cadillac prices. \n\nLike many Canadians, I've paid at least tens of thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) of dollars in taxes during my life time toward health care expenditures, and probably used less than $5,000 worth of  medical services. This being said, I'm in favour of universal, public health care (especially for children and the elderly), believing that the overall health of the society is a general good. Still, it's time to look more critically at what should and shouldn't be covered. Otherwise, health care spending will consume ever larger portions of tax dollars, at the expense of other public needs in Canada.",

There are literally less than 5 things cyclists can do to avoid crashes.  Me myself, I ride a bike literally everyday, and yes I see daily drivers doing dumb things.  But I am aware, I see it coming, and I avoid.  Just like in driving, one must ride a bike defensively, be aware, and be responsible for ensuring your own safety.  I also see cyclists, doing unsafe or unideal maneuvers.  It's everyone's responsibility to locomote in a pono manner.

It would probably be a full time job for someone to monitor and verify expenses and receipts. I think a better solution would be to only allow per diem when they are traveling away from their home district. That doesn't mean paying per diem to legislators from the Valley that come to Anchorage for meetings. Many of us commute and can't claim those expenses on our taxes or get reimbursed.

Homer saved the day by lassoing a donut to stop the runaway train (immortal line: Donuts! is there anything they cannot do!). Now the parable for the LRT in Hamilton, again is based on provincial politics,  of Hamilton the poor sister community in the GTA, their own self desire to be a \"big city\" and the continued public spend failures to revitalize the downtown core, of which a failed LRT will be another mill stone on the tax payers.

The CP-140 fleet needs replaced, and the 737-based P-8 is the prime contender - a similarly sized and capable CS300-derived airframe would work well. The CS300 would also be an appropriate platform for an AEW&C aircraft a la the 737/Wedgetail Australia bought. The Global is an excellent SAR platform, as evidenced by the Raytheon Sentinel. New Guardian-400s from Viking would also be excellent replacements of the DHC-6s in the arctic.

I just hate that the press played up the kick as if it was intentional - and it absolutely is related to Duke's Grayson Allen and the media highlights of that situation.  \n\nBrooks is not 'soft' he loves to draw contact and he has his own tricks, he been caught 'hooking' a defensive player a couple of times this year.   The guy that flew over his back should absolutley have been called for a foul.\n\nIt's all good, we won the game, Dillon did not injure his knee, the conference didn't impose any more panalty time, and wow, it was great to see Boucher step up huge.\n\nGreat road wins, now let's get the next 3 at home!

They compare total emissions between landfills and incinerators without adjusting for the amount of waste disposed (far more waste goes to landfills). Also, incinerator dioxin data is horribly underestimated in the U.S., by a factor of 30-50 times since they don't use continuous sampling, but only test for 6 hours a year on the facility's best behavior, without capturing data from when emissions are FAR higher during startup, shutdown and malfunction times.  Data on dioxin emissions from landfills are even more of a fiction, since the data is not collected, and it's basically all guesswork.",

It is an illusion that America has excellent health care.  The easy standard problems will be taken care of under pretty much any system.  The harder less common problems are not handled well now and treatment could only improve.  One example of possible radical change is computerization.  Symptoms are symptoms.  A lightly trained person could assist in gauging and interpreting symptoms and feed them together with standard blood tests results into advanced diagnostic computer programs.  The computers would order additional tests if diagnosis is uncertain.  We have the technology to computerize diagnosis now, but the medical industry stands in the way it would cost them money.",

And Jesus rejects the first when he said divorce was disallowed \"for any reason,\"  that is rejecting the Pharisee view. \n\n(BTW, Tridentinus, my Koine Greek is sufficient to test this interpretation again the text, and I am persuaded. What I cannot confirm on my own scholarship is whether the dispute among the Jews was indeed operative at that time, for that requires knowledge of the Talmud, and I don't have the wherewithal to go there.)",

The state, through KSBE's Myron Thompson and Hiram Fong and Dan Inouye, took the identity of the actual indigenous people of the Hawaiian Islands and diverted it to everyone able to claim ancestry to them. This throws a monkey wrench in using laws to conserve through taking property. Fabricating a false devotion, lip service, to the actual native Hawaiian through royal protocol and chanting is a colonial device thought to serve the conservation idea but this is a hope and a wish not a legal fact. There might be too much painful truth involved in folks with good intentions acknowledging the real harm done to the native Hawaiian by those with the skill to manipulate reality in their etc",

We could have avoided the boom/bust of the 1980s, and would be sitting pretty today, with a big enough nut to live off, in perpetuity.  \n\nI always have looked at the North Slope oil bonanza as a once-in-a-lifetime, windfall. You could either blow it all on fast living, or invest it, and live off the interest and dividends. We wound up somewhere on the lower end of that dichotomy.

The next level has two branches; assault causing bodily harm, and assault with a weapon. Those are self-explanatory. The next level is aggravated assault, which can be simply described as assault causing serious bodily harm. Finally, there is attempted murder, which is an assault committed with intent to kill. \n\nAny of the first three can be sexual assault if the assault is committed for  a sexual purpose. Sexual assaults are not categorized by the seriousness of the sexual component but, like ordinary assaults, primarily by the seriousness of the injury caused. \n\nVery low level sexual assaults, like very low level common assaults, are usually not prosecuted.",

A similar thing happens when certain types of interrogation technique are used--an innocent accused is led into confession. \nThe sad truth is that if children and their guardians do not come forward at the time of the abuse, some people will get away with it--but the innocent are not condemned either, which is the basis of the (imperfect) legal system.",

City.  \"Kitzhaber said he wants Oregon to transition to a mental health care system that’s focused on community based, preventive care for most patients a model that would be cheaper for \ntaxpayers and less restrictive for patients. At that point, the Junction City facility could transition \ninto a prison that specializes in treating mentally ill inmates, the governor said.\"  \n\nI'd like us to transition the facility to prison use for inmates selected for programs of \"early intervention\", substance abuse treatment, jobs training and reintegration into the community.  The facility would be perfect for a model program seeking to divert young, primarily \"first time\" inmates from becoming those \"revolving door\" recidivists.  .....and, yes, I'd enjoy discussing ideas with you and anyone else interested.  If you know Ms Fehey and think she might be interested, that would be great too.  regards, GAry Crum",

I have no desire to demonize him, but I cannot figure out for the life of me why he is insisting upon dividing our church along these lines. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, and praying father forgive them for they know not what they do, my first reaction was somewhat akin to yours concerning your political opponents. The question that popped into my mind was have they lost their minds? It's so sad to see those who should be inspiring us sinking to the level of a petty political hack job.

It is very easy to look up the facts - the Clinton Foundation has been a force for good - with no benefit to the Clintons' and over 90% of its donations going direct to help over 12 million people around the world to access life-saving medicines, while the Trump Foundation has been self serving and paid Trump and his family and made payments that benefit Trump - not others - and hasn't received a dollar from Trump in over 10 years. Trump reminds me of a 12y/o bully - quick to anger, stoops to name calling and shaming, and the most self-centered, self-absorbed human to run for President. He would rather destroy something if he can't win it. I am quite glad he is losing in the polls and people are finally running from his campaign.",

Here is what she said about a women's diaconate:  \"Permanent diaconate is basically a ministry of service. It is a compliant ministry of service, where obedience is its hallmark. Our patriarchal system views service as essentially a woman's duty. As long as the current gender norms govern the church, female diaconate, if it ever happens, will only uphold a gendered ecclesiology in theology and praxis. What is needed is not the incorporation of women into the lowest strata of the hierarchy, but the transformation of the whole church into diakonia [service].\"  \n\nShe also spoke about the way religious life is evolving. \n\nSee comment 2",

That deferral of child bearing is still keeping the birth rate down with a decreasing number of child bearing women having children young enough to increase the birth rate. There is a virtually unstoppable trend toward a lower birth rate, a higher proportion of aged in the population, and a smaller percentage of younger productive persons in a slow or non-growth or declining economy. We are heading to where Japan is and where much of Western Europe, and China are heading. What is offsetting this for the US is immigration.

Home a/c if it is going to use this, means adding a flammable gas which if leaking could pool in the basement.  This will mean that eqpt can not be retrofitted to use propane, but all new eqpt, likely a new furnace as well will be required to help reduce spark issues which could cause leaking propane to ignite.  So if you need a new a/c you will have to buy a new furnace.\n\nFor car based a/c systems, using propane could be disastrous during crashes.  A small fire could easily get gas to catch on fire, meaning many more fiery wrecks.

Having attended RC Mass long long ago, as a young person at an RC affiliated university, and now being a worshiper in a liturgical mainline church, the similarities are there but the theology is different. Take the Eucharist. If your congregants actually knew what they are supposed to believe, they would know that you hold that the perfect sacrifice of the cross is not once and done, but MUST be \"re-presented\" by a man with special \"ontological\" powers to act as a stand-in for Jesus. This is justified by the \"Time-warp\" argument that says time is meaningless to God.\n\nWe in the \"high\" church denominations certainly believe it is a sacrifice but one of praise and thanksgiving wherein we offer ourselves, our souls and bodies, imperfect as we are, to unite in the sacrament so that He may live in us and we in Him. He is present, but no do over of Calvary.",
