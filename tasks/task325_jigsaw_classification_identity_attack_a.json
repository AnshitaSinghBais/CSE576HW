First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Tricked by the political rhetoric of the illusionary funding for black-oriented social programs, he turns his anger to race - when he himself is the victim of class prejudice.\"\n\n\"[He] has worked hard all his life to become a 'good American;' he and his sons have fought on every battlefield - then he is made fun of because he likes the flag. The (code word) American is overtaxed and underserved at every level of government. He does not have fancy lawyers or expensive lobbyists getting him tax breaks on his income.\"",

(The term latent homosexual is no longer used except as a perjorative because psychology no longer considers homosexuality as a disorder. It never was, they just stopped listening to Catholic bishops who craved not religious freedom but religious power).  Some priests are very queer in affect but would never consider themselves homosexual. There is no reason not to ordain them or any gay man or married man or gay woman or married woman. It’s not a doctrinal issue. It has nothing to do with abuse and everything to do with Trad prejudice. The generation that insisted on that prejudice is dying out. Those of us who were not bold enough to resist are not far behind them but the younger adult generations will force change, not by voting with their feet but with their contribution envelopes.

But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?\"\n\nThat is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.

Of course conservatives will not support Muslims as they are on the other side of the fence therefore, Muslims they have no real friends in right or left.

The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner.  As Chief Justice Roger B. Taney said in the famous 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision about the Founding Fathers’ mindset in drafting the Constitution:\n\nBlacks had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. He was bought and sold and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic, whenever profit could be made by it.",

That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

Yet now I also hear, long after that initial \"fact\" was common knowledge, another \"fact\", ie the white child complained three times previously.\n\"Fact\": At no point did the child's mother desvribe the \"8 year old boy\"",

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: \"With Grave Concern\" (respectful thanks to Pius XI).",

There is no justification for Trump's failure to stand up and be counted with our other leaders of this country that have come forward to denounce this evil racism for what it is.

Of course, it is hard to see a problem when you are the beneficiary of that problem. Or maybe, equal protection under the law is just another white privilege.

The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA.

They looked at me like I was crazy and hassled many people when they tried to leave.  I then wrote letters to both the Mpls and St. Paul police federations asking then to meet with the residents of that community and get to know the residents and help them get ride of the gang bangers and drug dealers and end the senseless shootings and get positive publicity.

Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law. \n\n2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada? \n\n3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the \"white slave trade\". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)",

In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

The defensive nature of the concealed weapon relates directly to the SCOTUS Heller decision which carved out a personal right to firearms for self defense. The 9th Circuit, ignoring of the spirit of Heller, and using 14th-17th century English law  as precedent , thinks that because criminals might conceal their weapons until they can spring an ambush attack, that no one should be able to carry a concealed weapon in public for defense unless they can prove a compelling reason.

Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to five species per year. Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day [1].  . . .\n\n\"Unlike past mass extinctions, caused by events like asteroid strikes, volcanic eruptions, and natural climate shifts, the current crisis is almost entirely caused by us — humans. In fact, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming [3].\" \n\nhttp://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/biodiversity/elements_of_biodiversity/extinction_crisis/",

They built safeguards against this tyranny of the majority via the Electoral College and indirect election of Senators who were supposed to primarily represent state interests while the HOR represented citizen interests.

Could it possibly be that he contacted them near 10:05 p.m., just seconds before the gunman opened fire on the crowd? That would have given the first responders under 7 minutes to receive the call, rush over to the hotel and ride the elevator up 31 floors.

As for the expense of raising children, I certainly hear you.  Our son and his millennial wife have 2 young children and just paid an atrocious amount for a home in the lower mainland of B.C.   They are mortgaged to the hilt, both have jobs and are paying for daycare for 2 children.  Especially in B.C. and Ontario (lower mainland and Toronto and its suburbs), our provincial governments are 100% to blame for this and need to be held accountable.

'Lock her up' 'Lock her up'.   ...the intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to...  That's an easy target considering the mindless rabble constituency of conservatives.   ...a few simple themes for the simple minded repeated over and over...  'she's a liar' 'she's a criminal' 'lock her up'.  This is fodder for the foaming at the mouth Trump to spit out for his followers to eat, nourishing the hate.",

Obama appealed the decision to the Firth Circuit Court of Appeals which upheld both injunctions, but it did not stop DACA already in effect.  Following this set back, Obama withdrew the DAPA program and appealed the injunction against the expansion of DACA.  In a 4-4 split decision, the SCOTUS upheld the injunction against the expansion of DACA. The Obama administration continued with DACA already in effect but not with the expansion. In June 2017, Texas threatened to file a lawsuit against DACA 2012 if it was not ended by September 5, 2017, but did not do so.  Lo entiendes?",

The response of Francis and his team has become the same  as that of his predecessors:  tell us we should feel reassured by the shifting around of Curial chairs.   The loss of Marie should be a klaxon horn through the Vatican that business as usual has failed.  It should also be an alarm to the laity: we have no voice in the church's response.  \n\nAt this point, I really don't care what bishop sits in what position.  It doesn't matter anymore, if it ever did.  I don't even know if Francis will see her resignation as a loss for the church.  I do though.

They tend to offer the \"token\"  online short courses.\n\nI can 't think of one good reason why post graduate qualifications by research can't be offered completely online already. Sure, for qualifications where hands-on practical experience is needed we revert back to the bricks and mortar approach - but only when practicals are really needed - when there is theory involved, switch back to online avenues. \n\nThe values in a 3 or 4 year degree is steadily declining - especially in the tech space.

In the 1990's, when we were pushing manufacturing into Mexico, we tested the waters in China and it was a train wreck.  Now?  They have some of the quickest, cheapest, high tech manufacturing with full quality control systems.

Nobody gave the past nor anything else associated with it (British Empire; traditional religion) much thought, let alone reverence. No one individual personified this shift more than untraditional Pierre Eliot Trudeau, who persuaded the Queen to sever an historic association between Canada and Britain.\n\nNow history is useful again; a weapon wielded by the disaffected, the denigrated and disillusioned.

The party helped Ms.Clinton cheat Mr. Sanders, going to CNN and receiving the questions to a debate, thus giving her the unfair advantage. Ms. Clinton thus cheated Mr. Sanders, pretty much a fact, but I understand some would like to think it never happened, but sadly she did cheat.\n\n\nIt is all very easily researched, especially in today's age of technology. Look into it a bit. WIKILEAKS, although I don't care for them, revealed so much undesirable elements about the Democratic Party, I felt it was a shame they didn't do so to the Republican Party as well.\n\n\nIf you think Ms. Clinton was the most honest candidate to run, that is your prerogative and right, not going to argue that either, though I strongly disagree looking at her many evidenced lies throughout her history. All are entitled to believe what they desire, like I hear many Dems today would like her to just go away!  \n\nHave a wonderful evening!",

Part of the higher cost is attributable to our small towns spread across vast distances, quashing hope of economies of scale.  Thus, no HMOs in AK.  But another part of the higher cost is that doctors, clinics and hospitals charge much more in Alaska than they could for the same procedure in the Lower 49.  Read T. R. Reed's The Healing of America, in which he describes other countries' systems where doctors cannot legally charge more than a set fee for a procedure.  Medicare comes close to that, but, until we have a single payer U.S. system, not everyone is on Medicare, so those who must buy insurance policies get shafted by the insurance companies, which make bank off of Alaskans.  Remember the recurring Medicare \"fix\" because AK's procedure costs exceed Medicare allowable costs by so much?  This article only addresses one aspect.",

I know how hard he worked and how terrible he felt when one of his guys messed up in any way, let alone re-offended -- which over the years, a few did. Even after probation/parole, recidivism remains low for registered offenders in part, I think, because they've learned how to live safely, and in part because the registration is itself a kind of supervision. I'm not convinced that locking up priest-offenders together is the best way to respond to this problem; though for some of them it probably is.

And most definitely Al Gore should not be the \"middleman\" in handling 15 Trillion or even $1.00. His carbon footprint is greater than 99.9% of everyone in the world. All of the focus should be on how to incentivize industry to pursue clean energies and not on income redistribution (mainly from the U.S. to the rest of the world), with people like Al Gore taking a cut of the proceeds for himself. Al Gore is not a scientist. He has mislead the public for years with his scare tactics.

You can't even try to make an equivalency with a Mexican, or even an Irish flag flown for cultural celebration and the flag of the Confederacy which is only flown to project hate and intolerance.\nYou can try and sugar coat it all day long but in Georgia growing up that flag flew over my town square.

Then the Thief fights to get their stolen goods out of the store so they can get to their fence for cash,  then to their dealer for more drugs.\n\nAPD needs to make this issue a PRIORITY. The shoplifters are definitely organized, the people breaking into homes and outbuildings are getting there. Same with the car-theft ring that seems to be getting more brazen and prolific.\n\nTheft is a base-level crime.

As any unbiased comparison of our overall suicide rates with those of other developed, yet more gun restrictive, nations shows.\n\nOn a practical side, 70%+ of firearm suicides in the US are adult, non-prohibited, male gun owners (conversely, the rate for teens (under 20) all means is <3 per 100k).

A good example of this is when BC froze the  minimum wage at $8 an hour for ten years (with a $6 dollar an hour training wage!).\n\nRidiculously low, and an undefendable embarrassment. Yet business declared that  to raise it would see economic doom and gloom. The number of  op-eds from vested business interests were incredible. \n\nThis is the same sort of lobbying that has seen government steadily increasing the number of TFWs each year, and more and more sectors of business relying on imported labour.\n\nBringing in TFWs to compete for jobs with our high levels of immigrants (and citizens) imo is what places  downward pressure on wage growth.",

It all has to do with how people are and as hard is it for you to fathom, the more we try and incite people for our cause of the moment, the more individuals in the crowd will decide it is up to them to be the hero and kill the \"bad people\". You can laugh, but in each of these events, excuses for the crimes pop up that you laugh off, but the perpetrator fervently believes.",

Whenever they can't silence their opponents by shouting or name-calling, the leftist thugs wield baseball bats and hurl bottles of urine at their adversaries.

Also our relationships with advocates or defenders or \"consolers\" can vary as well; and there is no need at all why any of those people should be male. So the fixation on the choice of male gender in these cases as somehow revealing The Way Things Are, Like It Or Not, strikes me as an unnecessary, optional, culturally determined phenomenon.\n\nAnd that's fine, so long as we recognize it as such. \"Menu-crushing,\" btw, means imposing uniformity, eliminating options.

This program has adequate funds to meet the limited needs that it currently serves. St Vinnies also has a rental assisstance program, but it has almost zero funding, so it serves almost no one, though they receive about 20 calls per day asking for this type of assistance. I estimate that 3500 people per month could be served by such a rental assistance program at a cost of $600 per month to subsidize the rents on 2br apartments housing 4 people each for a total cost of $6.3 million dollars per year.",

Then they discovered 'globalization' which allowed them to set up companies around the world and have the corporate tax paid there (at much lower levels) with the profits becoming income to the rich (who didn't pay much on it).

Some have to be right about everything, even impossibly arcane details (like the age of the earth). Their faith is fragile - the smallest chink in their insular logic destroys their illusion of total understanding. Bones? Fossils? Impossible!\n\nMany others don't ascribe to this extreme view.

Requiring party leaders to be chosen this way from among sitting MPs is an excellent practice.  One member one vote hinges on celebrity and has brought the wrong leaders regularly to the major parties. Of course, a better solution is a party-less system of Consensus Government as practised up North..  Voters would only focus on electing their local representative from among a list of Independent candidates.  This results in a better form of representation, with all MPs' having equal say.

The loonie rose against the US greenback by 2.8% in September and against all other major currencies with the exception of the pound sterling, where there was a 0.4% drop. As the impact of this hike works its way through the economy it is bound to dampen consumer price inflation, which was already running much below the BoC’s 2% target rate, at 1.4%, in August.

Operators must avoid that, and everybody knows it, so nuclear power is sold at rock bottom prices, prices so low that nuclear energy comes close to being economically impracticable. Meanwhile, coal and oil power plants can be started and stopped for much, much lower cost, so they tend to come into their own during peak demand, when prices are at their highest. So, if we were to set up a system where all power is sold at the same price regardless of generation technology, we'd pull the rug out from under coal.",

Airlines have to strike a balance, and they are in the business of making money-- and as one commentor above correctly stated, fares have not kept pace with inflation and are actually lower than they *should* be based only on supply-demand.

'Protect themselves' is another way of saying 'injure or kill a threat to your family.'\n\nA gun is a tool, and that's nothing to be irrationally afraid of, but any rational person recognizes that the purpose of this particular tool is to kill living things.

The ore body is low quality, but huge--a worst case scenario in mining.

The losses are such with the ACA now, that that rural areas are even more harder hit than before the ACA. Many insurers are walking away limiting the choices in many states for those on the ACA, reason? Losing money even when subsidized! \nWhen all the private insurers walk away leaving states with the entire financial load, states will go under as the Medicaid rolls have accelerated under the ACA to record levels. The ACA has federal subsidies written to expire as well. \nOh, and single payer collapsed in Mr. Sander's home state in less than 10 years.

Progressives play nice only when you agree with them; their hypocritical double-standards and misunderstanding of the constitutional role of government in our lives are pathetic.

Lynch couldn't even fall down right.\nAgainst the Chargers, Siemian played like a second-year starter.\nAgainst Dallas, a magnificent overall performance by the Broncos and a superb defensive attack sent the Cowboys reeling. It was a vintage TrevorBig production.\nThen Denver fell as flat as the coastal plain of the Lone Star Republic against Buffalo. Denver's lack of scoring glowed most brightly with a second-half output of three points by the D-town team. TrevorLittle.\nAnd, so, the hated Raiders came bumping into town.\nThey left with a few new bumps.\nDenver's heroic Justin Simmons stole the game.\nSiemian, though, failed/transformed into ChickenLittle.\nIt is ChickenLittle season.",
