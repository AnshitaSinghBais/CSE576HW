There is no question about many of them having served with honor and distinction, but they did so serving in positions aligned with their sex at birth and wore uniforms consistent with their biological sex, of which there are only two, male and female.  However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

All I want is equal protection under the law. White racism makes that goal impossible. It is more than a little ironic that the lady in black face is a law professor. You can't make this stuff up.",

It is a way of preserving culture, hence a child with a Jewish father but a Christian mother is not considered Jewish.  Bias is not always about hating something.  It is about a love of something too.   That Obama was scarred says more about his lack of proper upbringing than about racism.  He should have been taught to love himself and his enemies and to overcome evil with good rather than vengeance.",

Of course, it is hard to see a problem when you are the beneficiary of that problem. Or maybe, equal protection under the law is just another white privilege. Most white folks seem happy with the situation. They think being polite and respectful to black people is like being lynched. BTW, the GOP wants to go back to the original Constitution.

The term refers to efforts to change government policies and laws on LGBT rights-related issues. Additionally, it has been used by social conservatives and others to describe alleged goals of LGBT rights activists, such as recruiting heterosexuals into what they term a \"homosexual lifestyle\".[1]\"  \n\nIMO, the \"real\" gay agenda is to be no longer treated as \"second-class\" citizens and be able to live their lives w/o being targeted with discrimination and much worse.  I don't feel that goal is unreasonable.  As used by those right-wing Christians it's a epithet designed to force homosexuals \"back into the closet where they belong!!!\"   Gary Crum",

For one, men who abuse women in the west, do it alone, there is not generally family members involved.  In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”",

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: \"With Grave Concern\" (respectful thanks to Pius XI).",

I thought that westerners lacked cultural understanding of Islam.  However after many recent years of Islamic terrorists murdering thousands of innocent people I no longer support Islam.  Islamic terrorism is a daily event (Russia is soup-de-jour today, I believe).  There are many countries with large Muslim minorities like France (how has that been working for you lately?).  There are Muslim countries like Turkey (which nightclub do you want to celebrate New Year's Eve in?).  I think Islam is a blight.   I think that Islam is a stupid and barbaric religion forever frozen in 7th century violence.  If I said this in a Muslim country I would be murdered.  If I said this in a European country my life would be in danger.  I believe that in Canada I can still safely say what I think,.... but for how long?",

THERE IS no other way. Trump is right on this point if not on anything else!",

For people to behave in a sexual matter with others of the same sex in ways that are only appropriate for those of the opposite sex is contrary to the order of creation and to nature, and gravely offensive to God.",

Not sure if the parts of the world in which Catholicism is now growing won't be in the same cycle of decline we are in now.  Educate people and then you have to treat them as educated, aware, thinking, adult.    That is the trick the Church hasn't yet learned.",

Yep, they are the big ticket departments, but the percentage of cuts is way high.  On the other hand, this may be the Governor's strategy to force our Tea Party legislators into a special session to raise taxes and find other revenue sources.  It may be working because it has caused a big hue and cry from Montanan's across the political spectrum and now the just say 'no' folks are waffling.",

First of all most commuters preferred traffic congestion reduction - not transit. Second of all, traffic congestion reduction without building more roads was already being introduced - on the highway and on the streets in 2005 - the 5th year of the 21st century.  And the state DOT at that time already had a Highways Modernization Plan: Oahu Projects. Until today, we have yet to hear of Traffic Congestion Reduction from the city DTS and state DOT.",

In one case, the train's projected ridership simply changed to meet the Bush II mandated higher ridership projections. It had no basis in reality.  The same is likely here.  Even Caldwell says that 800 people per train is unrealistically high.  I believe his more realistic ridership number is 600 per train.  Only 12 trains per hour in peak hours.  7200 riders per hour.  Even if you use a 3 hour peak period, that is only 21,600 max.  Repeat for pauhana return. Approx 43,000 riders.  Because of subsidy maximums under City law, tickets will be $3-4 if not more.  Looking at the ridership numbers, we now know that that fare likely be each way.  That means$6-8 to ride the train AND the 42 min. transit time does not incl the stops.",

Early Christians adopted the Greek NT, and thus inherited this translations \"error.\" When the Greek was translated into Latin, we got \"dominus\" (Latin for lord), and when the Latin was translated into English we got \"Lord.\"\n\nHowever, modern translations are direct from Hebrew to English, so translators have to decide between truthfully translation Yahweh as Yahweh, or adopting the Jewish convention.\n\nI suspect, but have not checked, that the substitution of \"God\" for \"Lord\" is an attempt at a middle ground.

So it follows that it can only be 'merciful' to open Communion up to the divorced-and-remarried, and indeed (following the logic further) to all comers.\n\nWhile we can't expect to hammer out a complete Eucharistic theology in a combox, I'd suggest this view is in many ways deficient.  An alternative is one in which the Eucharist encourages us to repent of our sins and reform our lives.

The imprisonment and torture of enemy combatants in Guantanamo is a separate debate with many similarities to that of the death penalty. A rightfully convicted murderer may be subject to reduced time, but not monetary reparations.",

Additionally, it would seem to me that parents who can afford to feed their kids should pay FULL price for the meal and be thankful for the convenience that other tax payers are providing if that is their choice.  This program should be solely directed at those who are classified as poor and the working poor.  From my reading of the Wikipedia article, it seems like the program is trying to do too much and is overly complicated but it has been a very long week for me so far and my reading comprehension is not at its best today.

If that were true, then they could have sent the drone to monitor whether there were casualties from that attack. That is not to say that the Syrian-Russian version is true, only that this supposed piece of evidence proves nothing.\n\nA Huffington Post article (http://huff.to/2nu5R56) points out that rebel forces have previously been found to have crude chemical weapons mixing chlorine gas and white phosphorus. If the chemical involved had been sarin, those attending to the victims would have needed protective gear, but several photos show this was not used.

Ask people in downtown Seattle or San Francisco.  They think giving homeless people better options is worth real money, since otherwise they simply congregate and camp in public areas.  Policing them isn't effective (ties up too much manpower).  Pushing them out just moves the problem elsewhere.  And, though it may disappoint you, a Darwinian solution isn't available; we can't let people simply die on our streets.\n\nThe first reason housing is so effective is that it disperses a population that otherwise has little choice but to hang out together wherever they are tolerated. The second is that housing gives otherwise hopeless people a motive to start taking better care of themselves.  A third is that housing keep children off the streets and out of cars; even a Darwinian should be able to see the point of saving children.",

Because Catholicism is homework, it automatically becomes an obligation.  \n\nThe solution would be one of two extremes: either to intensely educate kids about the deep theology and thinking behind Catholicism, or take a hands-free approach and try to plant a seed of curiosity about the Faith which will blossom with maturity.

That helped. Confirmation talk about Gifts and something about how they become fruits... And then, the Charismatics sort of put an umbrella over the whole topic. That was about it. I spent countless hours carving wood, making wood chips, and contemplating some of Merton's insights. The Trinity is dark from the outside... after a while I stopped making wood chips. What was left I called Trinity.\n\nCongar's three volume is hardly that. But I know when I am reaching beyond what I'm ready for... so, I turned the pages and offered my prayer to enlarge my heart.

Also the points raised by the CDF concerning AL were ignored, so it had no input at all in AL, it was deliberately excluded.\nIt is said that Müller realised this but stayed on hoping he could do more good in office than out of it. Alas, it was to no avail, like Cdl Burke he was unceremoniously dumped and his deputy promoted; no doubt a bitter pill to swallow in private.\nIn trying to not gainsay the Pope whose official voice he was and at the same time trying to uphold Catholic teaching, he walked a tightrope by attacking the 'dubia' Cdls whilst at the same time agreeing with them.

I find Trump's pronouncements on this entirely disingenuous when you consider his own businesses and where they are, but it's certainly good rabble-rousing rhetoric.  And not like the Clintons weren't familiar with similar hypocrisy.  The problem for East Canada is that resource extraction and exports is better for West Canada, we being less dependent on manufacturing jobs.

And most software tools nowadays do not require users to code. Thank God for GUI (Graphic User Interface). All knowledge is good though, and in context this is a valuable skill and for the right people a well paid one too !",

That is basically true in form but not in substance. In substance a government worker contributes to the economy and the living standards of the country as does a private worker.

Several prominent works of English prose published since WWII use \"dotard\" and \"dotage\".  One which readily comes to mind is Professor J. R. R. Tolkein's \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nModern English-speakers' ignorance of their own language is as common in the UK as it is here--a shame as it has more words than most other languages, so more descriptive terminology is lost; it's also not much fun when an insult isn't understood.

Indeed, the law is that someone can be incapacitated by alcohol and unable to consent before the point of being unconscious -- surely the minutes before passing out would be that degree of incapacity.  \n\nAlso note the judge specifically stated that the arrest and charges were justified given the circumstantial evidence that suggested there was an assault (and Blatchford's shock that he then contends that no evidence of assault was presented).  \n\nThe Crown is obliged to drop charges if they deem there is no possibility of conviction, not just because they think they might not win.

And, since you mentioned Hillary Clinton, it's also important to keep in mind that millions who pulled the lever for Trump did so first and foremost to keep her out of office, not out of fondness for him.\n\nIn other words, the narrative that Trump rode some massive wave of populist support is not accurate. What is accurate is that he ran against an historically weak opponent and still wasn't able to win a plurality of the votes. \n\nStill, it's fair to point out that the election was in November and opinions have changed since then. But the election results do provide a baseline against which to measure the rise or decline of Trump's popularity, which has steadily gone down in the months since he took office.\n\nRasmussen, by the way, tends to skew Republican.

The sex abuse scandal that erupted in the 90's has not changed things.  I have seen abusing priests moved to new parishes where they can re-offend.   I have seen abusers quietly asked to leave, while their superiors write letters of recommendations for them as they seek new employment in Institutions where they are again likely to abuse.  The Church says one thing about their intention to listen to victims, provide restitution, be watchful for prospective abusers, protect the vulnerable, etc. but, their actions speak much louder than their words as you outline above. \n\nThank you for trying!

She has been called \" anti-immigrant \" and even a bigot which seems a little over the top. She is not a front runner anyway; but I fail to see how expressing a little concern about values among immigrants makes her a bigot. So far polls, which can be misleading, indicate that her views are continuing to be supported by about 60% of Canadians, many of whom are immigrants themselves. Would she severely reduce immigration ?  No..... just a slight reduction in numbers and a little more caution. From many conversations I have had with immigrants, most agree that there are many dangerous people in the world who don't think much about our values of inclusion and tolerance. Many immigrants to Canada come from intolerant, conflict ridden parts of the globe; they are aware of the necessity to exercise a little caution over who is admitted to Canada.",

But the main reason why local officials do not want to cooperate with ICE is that it makes it harder to enforce local and state laws. There are approximately 2.2 million people in prison in the U.S., with approximately 2 million of those being in state prisons for having been convicted of violating state law (not federal law). So law enforcement in the U.S. is primarily a state and local function, not a federal government function.

All of these invertebrates are susceptible to toxic chemical residues. One concerning to me in the PNW region is the application of products to remove moss from yards or rooftops.    I've observed bees and flies on mossy, spongy surfaces where they can drink without risk of drowning.   Clean water is important. Pollinators drink water just like we do.   Also worth mentioning...while research is now addressing the toxicity of active ingredients in some herbicides and fungicides, very little attention has been paid to the so-called inactive (inert) ingredients or adjuvants.  Many times, it's impossible to even find out what these are.  Usually they include an oil or soap to enhance delivery of the active ingredient.  These are also toxic to pollinators.  Unfortunately regulation of these products tends to favor industry and economics over environmental ecology.",

You can google more information if you want to know how it works.\n\nTherefore, the assertion that the US is a democracy because Trump is now going to be president and HRC is not because he lost the popular vote is neither here nor there and really just comes across as sour grapes.  (And sour grapes is OK, but it doesn't make it true.)\n\nLook, Trump won 84% of the some 3,000 US counties and HRC won 16%, the democrats lost seats in both houses of congress, and democrats have lost over 1,000 seat in state legislatures across the country.  And the lost the presidency.  What this says is that HRC was a flawed candidate and democrat party is is a flawed party that the vast swatch of America doesn't believe in.",

With say 5 years of forward certainty on tariffs, a customer can make a more informed case for investing in generation or storage equipment.

And in the latest year for which there is data, 2016, it was 73.9 percent of the 11,831, 7870 Americans visiting Europe who sewed on a Canadian flag. That does not include 2,514 who had it tattooed on their foreheads.\n\nAgain, thank you.\n\n(Sarcasm off.)",

That may work in the US, but in Canada that is a sure way to lead to a massive defeat even if Trudeau isn't so popular.  My first choice was Michael Chong, followed by Lisa Raitt, then Erin O'Toole.

In the spirit of debate I'd like to respond to your comments.\n-The scientific case you refer to and that's outlined in Schatz's letter lacks proof that longline fishing is a threat to the habitat, biodiversity, or cultural artifacts in the proposed area.  And so I'd say the sasquatch analogy may be more appropriate for the argument in support.              \n-Pseudoscience is a term I used to call out proponents' willingness to mistake activism for science.  Activism wearing the guise of science is a form of pseudoscience.   \n-Who among the proponent camp is an expert in pelagic ecosystems?  The area in question is very different from the area within the current boundary.  When it comes to a scientific understanding of the proposed area I would argue that the pro-monument scientists and other supporters aren't so well credentialed.

Darwin himself used it in some of the later editions of Origin of Species, meaning \"better designed for an immediate, local environment\".\n\nUnfortunately, Spencer and some of his followers took the phrase in what they called a moral sense,  as an ethical precept that sanctioned cut-throat economic competition. Some of the more extreme Social Darwinists said that the poor should not be helped, since it would be aiding the \"less fit\" in surviving. They claimed that social caste was determined by natural superiority.",

Most have not committed any crime arising from their immigration status.  Many have lived in the US for years and have either married US citizens or have children who are US citizens by birth.  \n\nDue to dysfunctional US immigration policy, most undocumented immigrants do not have a path to citizenship, despite the fact that they may have children who are US citizens.  The federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) seeks to deport them.  However, county police and other local law enforcement agencies are not required to cooperate with ICE.  Doing so would raise the level of fear of deportation among undocumented immigrants, causing them to isolate themselves from local law enforcement agents and not to be forthcoming about crimes or suspected crimes.  As a result, our communities would be less safe.",

They don't bother me, I don't use the word \"troll\" because angry comments and extremist views don't bother me. I'm disturbed only by blatant racist or other discriminatory posts; but they are few and far between.\n  I believe we learn more from angry posts than those that simply make a liberal or conservative statement of fact or opinion. If someone is passionate about his or her views, they carry more clout, more gravitas, more importance than the same old same old pro-liberal or pro conservative opinions or political correctness.\n  In 11 1/2 years I had maybe 20 posts deleted by the moderator. That didn't bother me. But in three or four months with my fellow posters \"moderating\", I've had about 20 posts deleted. That bothers me very much. Getting fellow posters to censor other posters is a repugnant political contrivance.",

Today her actions (and Cromwell's) would be considered genocidal. The native Irish Catholic chieftains THROUGHOUT ALL of Ireland were dispossessed, the bards banned, the warriors forced to abandon traditional dress, the earls exiled, and the landholding and inheritance laws were redrawn in the English direction to favor Protestant Scots or English. The Irish masses were considered savages. By early 17th cent., out of a native population of a million and a half, five-sixth of them died of war, famine or pestilence. After 1650's, 20 years after arrival of the Puritans in Boston, Irish Catholics, who held two-thirds of the good land for centuries, lost it when it was passed into the hands of Protestants.",

If this were wrong, Flash Trading would not still be for sale and Michael Lewis would have been spending time in court with TD and CIBC over his claims. There is a recurring pattern here which the latest news on TD fits. And there is also a recurring pattern of sweetheart regulation in this country.

Sounds like there's an internal religious war going on from both sides.  Yeah, it isn't good.  But, how can a Christian nation like ours justify what we're doing in the middle east?

The fact that most Canadians don't cover their face isn't a function of cultural relativism, it's a function of progress. The niqab encourages cultural segregation and division. Canada can learn from Europe's mistakes of trying to appease assertive Islamism.",

Mexican nationals were shipped back using trucks, buses, planes and ships. The use of ships was discontinued after many drownings caused a public outcry in Mexico.\n.\nObviously to the Federal Government and the Mexicans, who had been invited to the U.S. under the Bracero program in 1942 to assist in the war effort, immigration was an issue in the 50's.

The same is true of CO2, as below about 100 ppm, all plant life would perish due to its inability to engage in photosynthesis.  Burn this formula into your brain: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light = C6H12O6 (Glucose) + 6O2.  It translates to 6 molecules of CO2 plus 6 molecules of water, in the presence of light energy, produces one molecule of glucose (a fundamental plant nutrient) plus 6 molecules of oxygen.  This is the most basic formula for life on earth.  If you want to eat or breathe, you'd best be thankful for CO2 and water, in equal proportion.",

The need in Eugene for subsidized housing is much greater than the supply. \n\nEveryone's situation is different. The amount of food stamps you get is based on your income and other considerations such as how many people you're supporting. \n\nNationally, food stamp amounts are inadequate. especially for people with kids, and do not last the month. The states run the program, and a lot of them are very restrictive. A whole lot of people in this country are struggling just to survive.

The issue is that if the current rules-based international order bulwarked by liberal democracies goes down the tubes to some degree, your standard of living (and mine) will be affected and the world will become a substantially worse place.\n\nQuite honestly if the government properly manned the existing CAF force structure and gave it the full complement of weapon systems that even its own doctrine calls for - that would be a dramatic improvement. Much of the current CAF outside NDHQ and other headquarters amounts to a hollow force and window dressing to its stated capabilities. Part of that, as job number one, would be putting defence procurement in one department (or an entirely new one) with the authority to get it done and holding one minister responsible for any bungling.",

If Assad wanted to strike terror into civilians mind, dropping high explosive bombs on markets and gathering places would serve better and yet not provoke as much wrath from western countries.  I find it unimaginable that Assad would be so stupid to use chemical weapons, a known trigger to outrage the west and the US in particular, when no clear military advantage ensured.  In fact, given the predictable US response, the killer rebels were likely encouraged and empowered in their struggle to oust Assad.  The killer rebels, on the other hand, had everything to gain by deploying the chemical weapons because of predictable western response.",

Ethanol is legal and is a decidedly higher risk to \"the health and welfare of our (sic) public\". It will stay legal because we value personal choice.\nMr Perry, do you realize that Richard Nixons staff person John Erlichman recently confirmed what many of us suspected; that the intent of the 'drug war' was to disrupt black/brown communities as well as the counter-culture and antiwar activists. \nThe drug war achieved its intended result. Mass incarceration and prison profits on an unprecedented level. \nYour contention is that cannabis is a health threat. You don't have data to back up this claim.\nBut, for discussion sake, lets say you do. So what? It is not your job to prohibit a relatively benign and widely used natural substance.",
