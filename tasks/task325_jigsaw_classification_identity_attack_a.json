If you supported the good guys, you were always worried about the bad guys winning the race.  Well, the good guys won because of Regan and we haven't had to worry to the same extend about nuclear war with the Soviets because of the win.  Second, we have a stronger NATO alliance because of the Soviet Union's collapse.  All of the former Soviet-occupied countries of eastern Europe (East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, The Czech Republic, etc.) are now on the side of the good guys, which means less chance of the bad guys (now Russia) starting anything nasty.  Yes, the world is safer because of Reagan.",

The fact that terrorist are able to use this ideology to justify their heinous actions (often with little condemnation from the wider Islamic world) only serves as a reminder of the incompatibility of Islamic ideology with western values.

A six month stay in a facility like this would be much cheaper than the numerous hospital stays where he would check himself out without medical approval as soon as he started to feel better and then relapse and then end up back in the hospital - a never ending cycle over 5 years.  Intensive counselling could potentially rewire the brain.",

In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

Maybe you should try it with your own perceived enemies... like Muslims.    Or maybe you aren't a Christian, I shouldn't assume that, sorry.",

However the statement \"Both plants contain bacteria-killing tannins that disrupt fermentation without interfering with a cow's digestion.\" is flat wrong. The way a ruminants digestion system works is by fermentation and disrupting it or killing the bacteria is disrupting the process. Bacteria do the work and in turn the ruminants digest the bacteria particularly for protein. Dead bacteria do not reproduce and fewer bacteria to digest means less protein and that means less meat per feed input. Simple as that.",

In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help.

Purchase of passenger vehicles was up by 3.8%, homeowners’ replacement cost (i.e. dwelling prices) by 4.3%, natural gas by 15.6%. And there will almost certainly be governments imposing additional costs in 2017 whatever the potential output gap. Often there is no difference between the CPIX and CPIXV8 rates of inflation, but in January the CPIX inflation rate was 1.7% versus 1.8% for CPIXV8, the difference being hikes in indirect taxes.",

No other province — including Ontario, with three times Alberta’s population — even comes close to matching this province’s contribution to the federation.”\n\nIf I had time i would find the facts going back thirty years.\n\nCant post article link so will post underneath here.  \n\nThe gist is Quebec gets 10 billion per year under equalization and the federal government keeps propping up that inept, corrupt governenment to buy votes thus rigging the game against all hard working Canadians.",

Both straight/gay alike who want' to act on sexual tendencies, are, hence, both called to lead celibate chaste lives. The Church specifies deep-seated homosexual behaviors as they differ. When a man sleeps with say a woman, they generally have a child - most often/common. Deep seated homosexual don't result in having to raise a child/children. Since people with preference of same gender cannot have children together. So the Church explicitly points out these actions do not follow from Christ's birth. Nor the necessity of life for Baptism. Also, the function of marriage between one man and one woman. That is why the homosexual act is scandalous, but isn't the worst of them.",

First, the  U.S.Papal Nuncio quashes a full investigation Of Archbishop Nienstadt, then Archbishop Hebda, claims that the church didn't really commit a crime by not acting on a known abuser but was \"guilty of a failure\". Failure?? What  a misnomer; the correct term is negligence! When a person's negligence results in harm to others, it can be considered a crime, even though  not intended.  If I'm driving in my car, not paying attention, and I rear end another car so that a person is crippled for life, I am considered negligent and will probably be convicted of some traffic crime. I  am guilty  of  damaging a person's good health. In the Twin cities case, the damage was emotional and spiritual. \n\n It seems hypocritical that children were emotionally maimed for life but it is only a failure, while our good sisters are called to the Vatican because someone doesn't like the way they minister to the poor?

In my view, respecting the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is key, having written decisions that do not make excuses for government and authorities who have violated the Charter, having written decisions that embody justice, plus showing vision, social values and character. I would also expect to find applicants who have crafted key decisions in Canadian jurisprudence.\n\nI would grill on past conflicts of interest such as serving as an adjudicator and corporate director for a regulator, and also corruption - ie a regulator that has hidden decisions favouring one side.

They cannot just go throwing out opinions with first being asked.  In this case someone filed a case against the government, the court sided with them.\n\nI am not sure what May is so concerned about - if she is sure in her position the court will side with the government in January.  If they don't she has to call a vote in Parliament - which she could have called any time since the referendum.

It is difficult to conceive how a more dangerous highway might be constructed.  The highway might be acceptable in rural Montana, but as the only highway south of Anchorage it is dangerously inadequate. Those who believe more traffic enforcement is the answer are living in a fool’s world. Enforcement is no substitute for a dangerously constructed highway. Just how low a speed limit would make the highway safe? It certainly isn’t the widely ignored 55 mph, and what's so special about 55 mph. Make it lower and it will only mean even more senseless speeding tickets. That the highway remains essentially unchanged for decades is disgraceful.",

This CNN article clearly explains this is a much more nuanced issue than you portray.  Trump's changes are to still require whole grains in food, but at the 50% level instead of 100%, allow for 1% milk instead of fat free milk and allow for sodium totals that aren't as strict as before.  (http://tinyurl.com/ya8dor2b) The article states that kids have been eating less of the school lunch meals since Mrs. Obama's more restrictive program went into place and there is anecdotal evidence of that across the board.  One researcher is quoted as not agreeing with that assessment but she also admits the kids are throwing out fruits and vegetables but as long as they're eating some of them, that's better than nothing...which I kinda find funny. In the end, it begs the question - you can serve strictly healthy food but if the kids won't eat it, what good does it do?",

District attorneys are charged with and rewarded for the most convictions/guilty pleas they can obtain.  Stripping judges of sentencing discretion placed enormous power in the hands of district attorney's which they typically use to force guilty pleas.  The media virtually never presents interviews with those who are forced to take a plea bargain so that we the public rarely get a perspective of what's actually going on.  In fact, the media typically reports guilty pleas with no discussion of the plea bargain involved.  Since DA's control the charge, they control the sentence.  For simple actions, the DA will level maybe ten charges.  Total sentence if convicted by a jury would typically be life.  Thus the dude must plead guilty when the DA offers to reduce charges regardless of true guilt because his defense attorney will tell him juries favor the DA.",

For example the high rents in Toronto are a result of asset price inflation in real estate.  In the case of retail stores, the higher rents that the stores pay are passed on to customers via higher prices for products that people buy. -----  Meanwhile, as I look at google maps of the areas near where I live, I see more and more \"social services\" occupying buildings and rental spaces.  Apparently governments are counter-acting the unemployment that would result from globalization by having more people employed  performing social services.  But then taxes have to be raised to pay for those services - that's another form of \"cost-push inflation\".",

On this level the deal presents less risk. A similar deal is not possible with less developed regions of the world. There an overwhelming proportion of benefit will accrue to multinational corporations and elites, and an overwhelming proportion of the dislocation risk would be borne by everyday citizens. This is where Trudeau's zeal for broad free trade is bad.

I mean, by God, this is 2017.  \n\nSo there is a difference in having a different view (I cannot condone the homosexual lifestyle so I am not going to bake you a cake) versus violence toward that person (yeah, I will bake you a cake, with something nasty inside it).\n\nChristianity doesn't throw gays off buildings or force women to cover themselves head to toe.\n\nFor the record, I am gay, so this issue is important.  And for the record, I am deeply sorry that someone would shout out things to people would appear to be very nice folks!",

Nowadays, anyone can call anyone...\"a racist\" and due to that, it has become almost worthless descriptive word.

Macron went into politics only in 2012 being appointed as deputy secretary-general to Hollande’s cabinet du president. Minister of the Economy for 2 years in Hollande’s government; unemployment grew 30 % under his watch. Unlike Canada, cabinet ministers do not have to hold a seat in the French parliament, but are appointed by the President. \n\nHe is seen as a clone of Hollande, others call him worse, a puppet, ‘un pantin’. The real clown is Hollande whose popularity reached the abysmal record of 4 %, yes four. And Hollande was behind the campaign that sabotaged Fillon’s bid with the Penelopegate. Regrettably for France and Europe that Fillon was disqualified.",

Both runs were healthy in the 80's; both are a mess now.

Tramadol is not a risk free medication. It has been known to cause seizures and induce delirium. Using it to treat opiate withdrawal is not medically supportable with the current information base. It is not approved for this purpose and there are no studies of adequate quality to justify its use in this way.\nAdditionally, having a provider with no DEA certification prescribing medications for the relief of  substance withdrawal is not acceptable practice. The medications used to treat alcohol withdrawal, in particular,  have ALWAYS required it.\nMore investigation needs to be done regarding the safety, validity and effectiveness  of the treatment that these clinics provide.",

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: \"With Grave Concern\" (respectful thanks to Pius XI).",

That would also mean that the navigation lights would have to be active.  Furthermore, the ship then would have to be manned with a crew to ensure that all landing cables are safe and not in danger of breaking.  I have seen the results of a landing cable snapping with loss of life and limbs and it is not pretty.  To have crew on board would means that they have to be fed, etc.  \nWhile the idea appears to be good, it is not practical.  \nBeing a former crewmember on the USS Kitty Hawk during the late 1960's, I would like to endorse this concept but a better use would be as a maritime museum.",

In this 2nd decade of the 21st European religious century, there is a tendency to white-wash the past, for emo-cringe reasons. In Hawaii, with the overthrow of the Kingdom in 1893 and the following annexation in 1898, the Hawaiian language was entirely banned from schools and government, and discouraged elsewhere. The Native Hawaiian culture was squashed because it was a \"terrorist threat\" to the Religious Republic of Hawaii. The ban of the Native Hawaiian language and culture in schools and government wasn't lifted until 1978.",

All the native elites howled and screamed in response and Pierre Trudeau backed down.

Employment-based immigrant visas (those that permit adjustment of status to permanent resident) are  often difficult to obtain and expensive and require an employer who is willing to pay the costs (including attorney fees).  Getting such a visa petition approved does not permit one to remain here.  One must apply for and get permanent residence to remain.  If one is not in lawful status, one cannot apply for permanent residence in the US, but must leave the country to process abroad.

The reason why Oregon public schools rank near the bottom is because the system passes kids who are NOT prepared for the next class. Where's the logic in that? Those who administer to the educational system are more interested in UNION amenities than educating the children. No to M97. It has little to do with public education and senior assistance programs.

This has been an issue that has gone back through a number of managers and hitting coaches... they have the biggest ballpark in the majors, almost impossible to defend in the OF, and if they hit singles and doubles all day long they'd rack up more runs than they do hitting homers. The current home-run-or-nothing craze is bad for baseball IMO but it's doubly bad for the Rockies.

Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.\n\n\"In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.\" \n\nLisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.\n\nLisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men.

This is highly, highly significant. Needless to say, advisors to the White House are not in the business of taking highly damaging stories and volunteering new information which makes them catastrophically damaging. The only reason a President’s allies ever do something like that is either to get ahead of something much more damaging or get a first crack at shaping the public understanding of something much more damaging.

The other is that the Lord's yoke is easy and his burden light, again, humanistic.\n\nWhy do you reject that path as if it is a bad thing?

This figure includes the Mint's fixed components for distribution and fabrication, as well as Mint overhead allocated to the penny. Fixed costs and overhead would have to be absorbed by other circulating coins without the penny. The loss from producing the one cent coin in the United States for the year of 2013 was $55,000,000.

Properties and stocks subject to capital gains can be bequeathed without the estate paying the outstanding tax  increased value, and the the deemed purchase value of these properties/stocks in the hands of  beneficiaries is reset to current market value. Is that correct?\n\nIn Canada we have never had an estate tax, and we have a simple rule that ensures all taxes on income earned while alive is paid--at death, anything subject to capital gains is deemed to have been sold on the day of death, the the deceased's terminal tax return (not the estate return) is taxed on the gains from those deemed sales.",

I think those two factors need to shift if the culture of the Church is going to shift with regard to the attitude that any person can have dominance over any other person. And I'd say that's all closely related to the model of Church, and I would dearly love to see our Church go back   to Vatican II, pick it up, read it and have a look at the model of Church. I know that has been said by other people, but I think it's really quite key. The way we think affects the way we act. If we are working out of a hierarchical model of Church, which is highly genderised, highly clericalised, we will not shift without shifting the model. I'm not sure I can say much more about that.

Which means the banks that back the credit cards can face federal sanctions. Which means cash, lots of cash.\n\nThen it comes down to how to handle the cash. The state could step in and set up a state run financial institution, basically a clearing house for the money. No loans, just a way for the dirty drug money to become clean.

Mr. Blackmore married 24 wives over 25 years and had 145 children. Did he collect Canada's child benefit payments for each? Did he declare 24 wives + 145 children as dependents on his tax return?

If ADN hadn't made open records requests of DOC, it all the deaths & abuses would've been swept under the rug.  Now that we know there's a problem, the state must go beyond a changing of the guard to clean up our prisons & ensure prisoners' rights, health, & safety are protected.

I doubt Professor Schurtz needs any re-education as I feel confident she has come to understand how what she did was in very poor judgement. I have a feeling though that a few of her most vociferous defenders might be more sympathetic to nazism than some would want to admit.

The 'progressive tax' on the rich kept the 'economic divide' in check and provided enough taxation to pay for government. \n\nOnce Reagan's tax changes of 1968 went through, the rich were no longer taxed significantly on their income which started growing (while jobs stagnated). Then they discovered 'globalization' which allowed them to set up companies around the world and have the corporate tax paid there (at much lower levels) with the profits becoming income to the rich (who didn't pay much on it). This brought an outflow of jobs from the US (mostly reflected in 'workplace participation, not 'unemployment numbers). \n\nToo much for one post. See replies",

When Fish and Feathers employees do the culling, or the public is given permits, there is usually no distinction made between the Alpha's and other wolves.  Were clear photos made (remotely activated Go Pro's) available, the Alpha's could be identified, and spared.  A good reason for sparing the Alphas is that wolves are intelligent enough to understand that hunting around certain areas almost always gets some of their pack killed, and the Alphas then display avoidance behavior.  A lot of the culling takes place in the deep woods, where the Alphas can't get any clue as to why they are being killed, nor where there may be \"safe\" areas.",

They are brainwashed as children by their Quran which demands that they lie about their intentions until they are in great  enough numbers to kill or enslave the infidels as the Quran tells them to. Mohammed their prophet was a pedophile and a mass murder. Islam does not fit my definition of religion. Does your religion ordered you to kill or enslave people not of your religion? Is it ok to lie about your true intentions? If you answered no then you are a civilized person and Islamophobia is common sense,",

Under Kubiak, the focus was so much on turning the ball over and some of the natural creativity was suppressed.  As far as his draft position, teams make mistakes all the time.  Tom Brady was a 6th round pick and is regarded as one of the best to play the game.  Kurt Warner was undrafted and is in the HOF.  But this is a make or break season for Trevor.  His stats at the end of the season has to be at least 25 to 30 TDs and no more than 15 INTs.  If he does that, then he has demonstrated growth and we can expect even better things in the future.",

How many of those people do you figure are smoking dope while driving back to where they came from ?  What about the increased emergency room visits by young kids who have got into their parents edible pot thinking it was ordinary cookies ? Or the house fires and explosions from people converting pot ? How many teenage kids are going to tell their parents what they are up to ?  It defies logic that if there is more of any substance in the home be it potato chips , pop , beer , or ice cream , that kids aren't going to have more access to it.  Heck , when I was a kid my dad used to hide the cookies from us kids but we were smart enough to find them.  How many kids take alcohol  from their parents home bar ?   Pot users didn't obey the law before legalization and they won't obey it now.  Pot cures nothing .",

Mexico has banned guns except bolt action 22lr for 40 years so they should not have any gun deaths, right?\n\nLaws do nothing to protect people.

If schools are forced to kick in millions more to cover PERS it will be a disaster.

Since these were land grant colleges, this low tuition is the way it had always been.  In fact it was nearly free until the time of Ronald Reagan.  Now in California there is a new law that will allow students to go to public Community Colleges free for the first 2 years.  The Republicans in California fought his for many years.  When my daughters attended college there was a parallel Catholic Education, charging tuition but flourishing.  There were many \"low paid\" nun and priest professors.  Perhaps a better choice for Catholic Education would be to get more money from the diocese, but then there is the problem of Episcopal interference with the  curriculum, but many schools already have that in the form of Bishops licensing theologians.  I think for Catholic Educators to fear more  free education will prove  self-defeating.  We must not allow the elite to dumb down people.",

When I walked out the door of the Roman Catholic Church, I have never looked back.    I love many Catholics, but the Roman Catholic Church is a misogynist and homophobic institution that has oppressed different groups for centuries.   It is dying out in the west, and will eventually only exist in developing countries.   Gay Christians  will find a home in the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the United Church of Christ where they are generally welcomed in the ministry.",

On the odd occasion that the courts find the killings unjustified, the police usually keep their jobs and pensions. They get time off with pay and counseling to recover from being a murderer. The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA. I guess killing black children is patriotic for some white folks. They are easier and safer to kill than unarmed black teens and adults. The children almost never fight back.",

To be fair, he did not mention Clinton's name and he did not recommend a vote for Donald Trump; but his meaning was unmistakable.

Already, I regret that I did -- and I'll probably confess it the next time I go to confession.  And I will discuss it with the priest-celebrant.  But this gets precisely to your point -- the church's ministers must find the language to promote Christian and Catholic teaching, and support the exercise of the voting franchise, without being complicit in the election of Donald Trump; indeed, without endorsing anyone.

Which means that C corps will push to decrease taxes, even if it robs them of their ability to compete internationally with companies that have access to better infrastructure and training of employees. So, yes, profit is good is capital can be used in all sorts of beneficial ways. But, like all things, there is a balance point where the marginal utility of new profit is less valuable than government investments.

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true. So I just want to apologize let u know that I understand now.I am sorry that you have to still encountr ignorance",

At least Kessinger could speak French with the North Vietnamese in his negotiation for the removal of US soldiers from the conflict.\n\nToday the conflict between Taiwan and China is much more complicated with China much more powerful and our decades of meddling. We've created greater hostile feelings between the two parties. Like the Koreans this is really unfinished World War II business.\n\nIt would have been easier during WWII when both sides were grateful for our help in defeating the Japanese.",

Depending on what else is occupying the liver at the time, the liver can harmlessly metabolize low rates of fructose into glucose or lactate, but when overwhelmed the liver metabolizes fructose into triglycerides (palmitic acid saturated fat), much of which gets put into VLDL particles with cholesterol for transport to cells. If the liver is yet still overwhelmed, triglyceride accumulates locally as liver fat, leading to insulin resistance in the liver and metabolic syndrome.\n\nThere is no significant difference between HFCS, table sugar, cane sugar or fruit sugar.
