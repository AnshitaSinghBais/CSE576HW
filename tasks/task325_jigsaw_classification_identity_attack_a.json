They are supporting the chopping off of healthy body parts & putting people on life long hormones.  Young women are taking testostorone right now without knowing long term effects. There are no studies.  Sure Gender dysphoria is a medical condition that requires compassion & all people need to be respected but let's stop celebrating this.

He looked down on white people and Christians.\n\nThe radical Malcolm X himself converted him to follow the Nation of Islam, which is a well recognized hate group with strong antisemitism, and gave him his name of Muhammad Ali.  Ali was against the assimilation of blacks into American culture and society, and opposed miscegenation.\n\nAnd he was not that good a husband or father either, divorcing 3 wives.  He divorced his 1st wife after she refused to dress like a Muslim: \"I even divorced my wife… just because she wouldn't wear dresses long enough\"\n\nAnd he attacked the USA repeatedly.  He called Vietnam \"a white man's war\", and said that \"My enemy is the white people!\"  \n\nOther quotes from Ali: \"All Jews and gentiles are devils\",  \"The sins of drinking, smoking, prostitution, homosexuality, stealing, gambling: It all comes from white people.\"",

As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence.

On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster.

And Facebook is totally there for you!\n\nAt the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user.

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

Looking at  grocery expenses only, that helps support the grocer, his employees, his landlord and the food processors or growers++ all of whom pay taxes to the governments, and their own living expenses, (generating more tax revenue).

The fact that terrorist are able to use this ideology to justify their heinous actions (often with little condemnation from the wider Islamic world) only serves as a reminder of the incompatibility of Islamic ideology with western values.

In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

The very fact that the hierarchal church doesn't do a disciplined, medical/scientific research on the nature of homosexuality---but practices exclusion, retaliation, and winks at vindictiveness against members of the LGBT community, is evidence of this   We have abused other groups of peoples as well: the Jews, slaves, women.  Today, the official church has made members of the LGBT the new lepers in our society.",

How dare ADN push your garbage of anti-women, anti-children, anti-family and anti-decency.\nYou are also one of the many liberals who are obsessed with sex. We have just suffered 8 long years of the decline of decency in America. Entertainers are pornographic, more than talented and almost half of the country laps it up daily.",

Said Webb a few years ago: \"Glen was very, very good at commercializing my songs. He could come up with great intros and great solos, great breaks, and he wrote perfect strings...\"  Campbell may have had a hand in the outstanding musical arrangement of this particular hit. After Campbell stops singing the orchestra--and that great guitar--go on for at least another 30 seconds. The hit is regarded as an anti-war protest song, but Webb insisted it was just the story of man who just wanted to go back home. The \"I still hear your sea waves crashing\" lyrics were changed. Originally, the verse was:\n\n\"Wonder if she could forget me\n\"I'd go home if they would let me\n\"Put down this gun\n\"And go to Galveston.\"",

Why is there no uptick in schizophrenia in Holland, Spain, Uruguay or any of the states in the US with cannabis legalisation?  Cannabis can uncap schizophrenia if you already have it, but haven't been diagnosed.  That's as far as it goes.  Have you considered that people suffering from schizophrenia maybe use cannabis for symptom relief?  Correlation isn't causation my friend.

The Confederacy is sometimes romanticized as the \"Lost Cause\"; we need to remember that what was \"lost\" was the right to buy and sell human beings; and we need to remember the terrible cost in human terms.",

To make matters worse, a majority of the units are owned by iStar which allows them to control the AOAO board of directors voting power. This leaves individual owners finding they make no profits if they participate in the rental pool and owners not in the rental pool are paying exorbitant fees and having their guests treated differently. It would be nice if this case decision would encourage Aston to comply, but it is probably just making them smarter on how to get away with the same things but not to be caught this time.",

Frequently, they don't see themselves as poor even when they actually are. Rather they view themselves as temporarily \"down on their luck\" and look up to the rich (Trump-like figures) as role models even though in reality they have almost no chance of emulating them, their lifestyles or wealth especially in the absence of an education. The white lower middle class men (especially) seem to view educated women (like Hillary Clinton or professional women) with disdain. \nClass isn't as cogent in America not because of elitism in academia (which of course exists) but rather because Americans eschew class comparisons and the very idea of equality.",

Allowing huge numbers of refugees into Germany in a very short period of time can cause a variety of rather predictable short and long term problems. In addition to causing problems for the local population, this also creates problems for other European countries which had nothing to do with these policies, and encourages more and more refugees to come, from more and more countries. This, in turn, leads to social unrest, and may actually encourage more refugees to risk their lives by attempting unsafe passage to Europe. So, actually, Merkel's reckless and poorly thought out policies can have a negative impact on many people in several countries for years to come and are not above criticism.

When things finally go bad (and the system was declining prior to this season), the smartest men/women in the room who created the system now look like fools for not adapting. In the end, what fixes the system is leadership, experience, savvy, and as much as we don't like to admit it, some good fortune or luck.

This vanguard is actually objectively contemptuous of the poor and the working class. They want to change them utterly and essentially. They themselves are thoroughly integrated into the neoliberal order--nothing else is legitimate. The more left-leaning among them lost their way in the march into the institutions. They now believe that Manhattanite ethics will lead to the true Progressive future. And, of course, they are Correct, if not true.",

Banning flavours that \"could\" appeal to teens deploys a very broad brush, which might end up restricting flavours that appeal to adults too. Since vaping acts as a vastly less harmful competitor to traditional cigarettes, this is very foolish. They run the risk of neutralizing one of the main advantages that attracts smokers to vaping, the flavoured liquids. Every restriction on vaping only protects the combustible tobacco industry.",

I'm all for helping the people that were productive members of society.  But instead of us trying to decide who deserves help more, I think we should see which homeless will accept help and dedicate resources to them.  You can't force addiction counseling on someone that has no intention to quitting or to change their lives and expect it work.  If they have been homeless for 20 years or 20 months I don't really care, as long as they are making an effort to stay off the streets and out of hospitals, jail and detox.

It's one thing to set up informal communications systems with other governments but a totally different treasonous act to see if Trump can use the Russian's secure communications networks so he can talk privately with his BFF Putin.  Who is Trump hiding his communications from?  Maybe Trump's last 25 years of laundering Russian KGB mafia money for the BFF's of Putin would be the need for hiding his communications from the Counter-intelligence folks at the FBI or NSA.  If any other citizen approached the Russians to use their secret systems to communicate with the Kremlin, one would suspect treason, how do you explain this away Trumpkins?",

The only way to pay for this horrible disaster is to raise property taxes, extend the GET into perpetuity, cut city services, increase the TAT and that may still not be enough to cover operation and maintenance.

One statement grabbed me, \"Officials also needed to do a better job monitoring its vehicle contract.\" Ansaldo was not performing well, was in trouble with other deliveries and had quality problems. Then Ansaldo was sold. I may have the timing off, but aside from cost over runs on the guideway itself, the issue with the cars was telling. The original choice of Ansaldo seemed like a bad one from the outset, and it turned out to be so. Maybe HART just wanted to avoid more embarrassment. But Grube is dead right. These are public funds, HART is a public agency. Failure of HART to be transparent to the public is a sin which transcends many others. These enormous cost over runs are related to the original design and engineering. Why were not all the construction problems (unknown utilities for example) better  accounted for in the beginning? Why so much archaeology never done?",

Donkel has been arguing against cuts to credits and tax deductions for oil corps for some time.  There are  a bunch of outside corporations that want what we have.

Dorf, \"Beating Hearts: Abortion and Animal Rights.\" Their analysis of the morality of these issues, legal approaches to them, and the movements associated with them, arranged more or less in a compare-and-contrast discussion, is well done. Their own attitude on abortion, which they explain well, is that it should be legal, out of regard for the interests of the pregnant woman, but that once the fetus becomes sentient (NOT viable; prior to that, the fetus is not a being holding a stake), the woman is faced with a serious moral challenge. My guess is they would approve the provision that an ultrasound be offered her.",

We did nothing other than work, farm, serve country (my brother in the Navy) for the next 58 years when, with no notice or hearing, it was stripped.  \nI do not agree,  I think we had a right to Notice, Hearing and a way to appeal that revocation.

The money in our savings account is only there because of the progressively clause of ACES that allowed the state to sock away $17 Billion when oil prices were high. Now we lose at both high and low oil prices and will never be able to put money away even if oil rises to $100/bbl again. When the price of oil under ACES went up the state got a larger share of  the value of OUR oil. Under SB21 we receive the same tax rate as at low oil prices only now all fields developed since 2002 will be deemed \"new oil\" and taxed at the extremely low rate we see now at low oil prices. SB21 never \"seemed worth it\" unless you were totally in thrall to the millions of dollars in oil industry propaganda deluging our air waves.",

The 50th percentile is, by definition, average. If every corporation tries to pay its CEO more than average, the average will rise.\n\nI would suggest that compensation committees should start looking at the 25th percentile; if that practice becomes widespread, it will change the upward pressure on CEO pay to downward pressure.",

But do you like water? Put any value on it? Your grandparents, most of them farmers, certainly did. Coal-burning electrical plants consume plenty of water in their operation, while heating what's recovered to fish-killing levels. Because of this change, that water will be saved.

Trump has a 35 percent approval rating among independent voters.\n\nBy comparison, the first Quinnipiac poll after President Obama was first inaugurated showed him at a 59 percent approval rating.\"",

This is in contrast to countries like France and America that have public union disclosure as a result of union leadership in seeking and supporting it. Numerous other nations such as Germany and Australia also have public union financial disclosure.\n\nLabour organizations are exempt from taxation. Unionized Canadians who pay dues deduct those dues from their taxable income. Dues are almost always a “condition of employment” – employees who do not pay them can be fired from their jobs – a possibility sanctioned by labour codes. Strike pay is also not taxable income. Unions transfer dues to local, provincial and national umbrella labour organizations.\nhttp://www.labourwatch.com/topics/disclosure",

Women who subscribe to the Islamic faith but embrace their independence as empowered liberal Muslims are shunned, intimidated, and even threatened with physical violence.  There is a reason Ataturk implemented strict secular rules at the founding of modern Turkey, it's because Islamists never stop - Ataturk's vision lasted for almost 70 years and it has taken Erdogan's AKP under 8 years to regress Turkey towards Iran circa 1979, go figure.",

We were reading Johannes Baptist Metz, and he grounded that remarkable thinker's life's work in a personal question, offering a clarifying contrast.\n\nMetz and Ratzinger were roughly the same age, raised in nearby Bavarian villages.  Their early social and religious experiences so similar, yet their life work so different.  The Holocaust set the question with which Metz has grappled ever since:  How was it possible that, in such devout Catholic setting, fervent, believing Catholics offered so little, if any, resistance to the rise of absolute evil in history?

And here we have a tender spot of \"liberalism.\" If we want to support a potentially meaningful effort, I suggest we lend our voices to the call for congress to open discussion on the matter of reparations.

The beautiful setting at Moanalua Gardens was a major part of the experience, including the dilapidated but iconic home of King Kamehameha V and his lo'i halo.\n\nOver the years the festival (just like the Hokule'a homecoming) became increasingly politicized -- OHA had a booth with propaganda for the Akaka bill and tried to get people to sign up (kau inoa) for its wannabe tribe.  Opening ceremonies were marred with speeches (Brickwood Galuteria, Kimo Kahoano, Vicky Holt) rousing racial pride and tribalism.  Booths of profit-making vendors proliferated, unrelated to hula: clothing, jewelry, etc.\n\nHoopla and politicization are now out of control.  Hula will be a mere vestigial piece of the festival's anatomy (like an appendix, or tailbone).  Lota died long before the current Palace was built; no connection to Prince Lot.  Sad.  Skip it.",

What does this have to do with the national anthem? Because the anthem is basically faith in your country through the worst the world can offer including war (where it was written), so kneeling is saying you have lost faith in your countries ability to make it through the battle. Had these players had even double digit IQ's, they would stand up tall...take their earnings and build programs or work with neighborhoods to improve police-citizen encounters to be more professional and less risky. So them taking a kneel is a spit in your face and you're swallowing it.",

Less cost on a monthly basis for the same living space as the big ol' house, Less property tax bite, less work and maintenance cost, and--less is more--a whole lot more retirement savings at the  end of the transaction.\n\nThe real message here, is: timing is everything.  (This couple made their move just before the foreign tax artificially changed the market.) Timing is VERY good for Marcon Developments, too: \"...the beginning of a potential flood of downsizers that will become one of the biggest drivers of the condo market.\" Not just condos, either.

Raise that property tax and you get higher cost of doing business for property owners which results in higher rents. Higher rents mean those who are struggling to pay their rent end up losing the place they call home. And for those who are struggling to find an affordable place to live, they now have higher rents to look forward to. Instead we build so-called \"affordable\" housing that do not even come close to solving the problem. Instead it enriches those who are building luxury condos.

If water served as the catalyst for Jesus's spiritual ascension, why does he never perform a baptism? Why take the name Christ? And why anoint his flock in oil before sending them out to anoint others, as described in Mark 6:13: They cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.\n\nThe Gnostics believed Jesus's baptism took place, but only as a cleansing ritual, in preparation for receiving holy anointing oil—the true sacrament. As Chris Bennett writes, “The surviving Gnostic descriptions of the effects of the anointing rite make it very clear that the holy oil had intense psychoactive properties that prepared the recipient for entrance into ‘unfading bliss.’\n\nToo bad these anti-Christian, \"Christians\" on the Kenai and in the Valley don't get it.",

The dogmatic refusal to offer assisted dying is dogmatism pure and simple, and it is an unfair characterisation to speak of dogmatism only with respect to those who support assisted dying.

This would have the effect of creating stateless children, but that would be something thoughtful parents should consider. Nothing forces naturalized Canadian citizens to reside permanently in Canada.

In this “Edmonton theatre cancels Othello” article, I wrote about a major purpose of public domain, a key concept of copyright law.\n\n2. For reasons known only to yourself, you chose to join in with this gratuitous attack: “An invented factoid.”\n\n3. I responded – politely -  with a long excerpt from an academic legal paper supporting my comment about public domain.\n\n4. You did not respond, although you continued to post here.   You still haven’t.\n\n5. When replying to your many other posts here and elsewhere, I deliberately added prompts such as “So . . . no brilliant post about copyright and public domain. Darn.”   To that one, you continued to avoid responding to point #3, with “nope can't say it without violating the rules on civility.”\n\n6. Finally, you posted   \"As for you bizarre comments and winks about copyright I have no idea to what you are referring.\"  Incredible.  Well, not incredible for JC12345.",

As someone who has spent allot of time working in the Chinatown area, transgender folks are all over the streets there, mostly at night, but also during the day. Much higher profile in Chinatown than any other area you may visit. The majority you see on those streets are prostitutes and of course, drugs are part of that.

Only a handful of people I met in this position came out the better.  Many admit that they were abused -sexually or otherwise- by foster parents, and we will never know how widespread the actual abuse was because so many of these removed children met an untimely end through misadventure due to questionable lifestyles in adulthood...but we also know that people who live questionable lifestyles are more than likely the products of the manner in which they were raised, so even this would not bode well for the settler parents taking in Native children.\n\nI can only hope that just is served, but the courts usually pander to the mores of settler society, so I bet that there will be an appeal of this decision.",

Let's say a company pays the 2.5% tax and passes the cost to consumers by increasing pricing. Oregonians are ~1/100th of the US population, so a national pricing scheme would increase prices by .025%, barely a blip to any Oregon consumer. That's a 100:1 return for Oregonians as a worst case scenario for a mega corp with national pricing schemes... a great deal!\n\nI don't even know where to begin though if you are asking if companies use pricing elasticity as part of their pricing strategy. Of course they do. Apple iPhones are constantly priced throughout a year even though currency exchange rates and cost of good fluctuates throughout the year. If every change in price gets passed to the consumer there would be weekly price changes... there are not. \n\nSo, what percent of sales in Oregon would be affected by this tax? That's something I would like to know.",

There is NO amount of subsequent breast-beating and soft words that can undo the loss of trust this secrecy  triggers among the laity.

However, I'm finding that for the younger dentists who are willing to relocate to a rural setting, the choice is not made in isolation and is much more complex than their own willingness to relocate upon graduation. A spouse or partner of a dentist may prefer to stay in the big cities where the couple is seeking to raise children and send them to the best public, private or religious schools. They may want to be close to their parents who may need support or have health concerns. We can't blame a dentist for considering family circumstances and placing their spouse and children's interests ahead of their own. If you met your spouse or partner during graduate school or undergraduate studies, chances are that you didn't consider his or her willingness to relocate away from family and friends.\n\nSina S.
