    "Definition": "This task is a classification task. Given the tokens as input and 7 categories to categorize the tokens namely o, B-header, I-header, B-question, I-question, B-answer and I-answer, select the category for each word in the tokens given as input in the string format. The output is supposed to be the words grouped into different categories to which they most closely relate. The words which depict a title or are written boldy to depict a spcific heading will come under the header category. The words which are in the question pattern or depict the fields which will need an answer after them, will come under the questions category. The words which are simple names or nouns will come under the answer category. All the other words which can't be categorized into header, answer and question will come under the other i.e. o category.",

The CTS400 has the additional measurement of cigarette hardness in comparison with the CTS300. With this added, measurement R&D will be able to replace the Firmness Integrator that measures cigarette firmness in to other addition measurements that are mentioned above. The Firmness Integrator is no longer manufactured and parts are becoming difficult to obtain. Lastly, of this instrument would purchase provide similar capability as the Macon Plant and help facilitate comparisions between laboratories.
