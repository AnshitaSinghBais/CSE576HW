We live in a global economy...things change and they change fast. Six months from now we could be talking about rate cuts. In the last 35 years people who took variable over fixed came out ahead around 89% of the time on interest savings alone...not to mention the flexibility of having a small penalty should you want to refinance or pay out your mortgage.",

And then when he finally got the picture he became aggressive and began calling me every name under the sun. His tone quickly changed from I want to do sexual stuff with you to you're fat and ugly anyway.

Needless to say I did indeed block him and still have him blocked.

Trudeau is polling 10% above his closest competitor, the Conservatives. He's on track to win another healthy majority. The next municipal election is John Tory's to lose - with Ford in the race, it's very likely that Tory's electoral coalition will be just as motivated as last time and he'll get a second term.

While the top positions were held by the \"purebreds\", an empire needs a large number of middle and lower middle class workers, soldiers, bureaucrats, etc. In Latin America, these obs were filled by the mixed races. The pure blooded natives were at the bottom, like the blacks in the USA.\n\nAs for China, as pointed out, their empires contained Chinese, Mongols, Koreans, Burmese, Tibetans, Naxi, Central Asians, etc. Those who don't know much about Asia might think all these countries are the same, but they are not.

Even Australia and Germany are abandoning \"green\" targets but Trudeau goes full steam ahead with absolutely no concept of implementation costs - it's the naive idealism of symbolic platitudes that count #becauseit's2017. Canada's resource sector has led the economy in value creation and wage growth and yet Trudeau focuses on deference to the career activists who protest for a living.",

Western bishops at the Third Council of Toledo in 589 AD added \"and the son\" to the original version of the creed.  Therefore, the Catholic Profession of Faith states today, \"proceeds from the Father and the Son.\"  But scripture is clear that Jesus says unequivocally, \"I will send him [the Holy Spirit] to you.\"  The Greek Christians agreed with this, but they argued that 'sending' and 'proceeding' are not the same thing.  To them, the word \"proceed\" was equivalent to the word 'begot,' as in the verse in the creed which refers to the Son as begotten of the Father.  Greek Christians argued that ONLY the Father could beget, and thus BOTH the Son and the Spirit had to proceed from the Father.",

Paul then greets Prisca [nick-name for Priscilla] and her husband Aquila---who worked side-by-side with Paul.  This couple heard Apollos speak boldly about Jesus in the Jewish synagogue---but not correctly[Acts 18:24-26].  Luke writes, \"they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately\" [Acts 18:26].\n\nPaul commends Mary, who worked very hard in Rome.  Paul calls Andronicus and Junia, his relatives, early Christians and prominent among the apostles.\nThese women DID speak in church.

Crosstabbing employment status by ideology, we don't see anything like what AHHA suggests.  In the total population, 55.2% are full-time, 13.9% are part-time, for a total employed number of 69.1%.  Conservatives were 57.6% + 9.3% = 66.9%, the moderates were 53.8% + 16.2% = 70.0% and the progressives were 54.3% + 16.0% = 70.3%.  So while conservatives have a marginally higher full-time percent, they also show the lowest total employment.  The reality is though that there is no significance in the relationship.

No, the media tells us what Trump thinks based on failure to conform to their script.  Hurrah for the Donald.  Keep on frustrating the puppet masters.",

The Polynesians rioted when her brother David Kalakaua stole the election for Monarch from Queen Emma, and looked upon her and her brother as usurpers, as they were not from the Kamehameha clan, but from the Aikanaka clan.  When Liliuokalani came to the throne and made the customary tour of the island the Polynesians refused to bring food stuffs out to her entourage at each stop.  The royal help were forced to ask the white folks for food which they gladly gave.\nIn 1895 she could only muster less than 175 men to take part in her dismal counter revolution.  Why?",

Less than six months later the DPRK signed the Armistice cease fire - - not a peace treaty which is why we are still technically in a state of conflict.\n\nIf this guess is true, Trump may well end this ambiguity by asking Congress to declare a state of WAR exists between the USA and the nuclear armed DPRK. To do that he must first get the backing of ‘we the people’ because, left to its own devices, Congress is sure to crawfish away from doing its duty AGAIN.\n\nIke's plain talk paid off: for the next 8 years there was not a single American combat death and Trump is aware of this.",

Proving their liberal bona fides requires them to continually cull their own herd, and the fear of being culled themselves insures they will repeat the process.\n\nMy preference is for everyone to express themselves as they wish without others taking offense or fearing a return to injustice or culling.

He and the bag lady Hillary created what Obama termed the worst foreign policy failure on his watch. Then like our former 'bush league' mission accomplished bad actor, after the Iraqi war,Harper was stupid enough to stage a victory flyover in Ottawa celebrating his 'victory' in Libya.

Agreed--so why draw the infield in then?\n\nHis defenders can't have it both ways.  That 6th run obviously mattered very much to Gibbons.  And the question, which was never asked, never discussed, never brought up, that needs to be put to Gibbons, is why?\n\nMaybe it makes no diff in that situation, but if you cannot even get that right, why would anyone trust his impulse when it really does matter?",

Meanwhile, hundreds if not thousands of 'local experts' will constantly weigh in with proof positive either favoring or denouncing the theory, no matter how funny their logic or proof is.  As for me, I turn to one undeniable fact that we are in a period of Global Warming; The Smithsonian polled all 310 certified climatologists on file and record with them some 5 or 6 years ago and 309 stated unequivocally that yes, we are in a climatic period of Global Warming.

First, so called Natural Forcings caused by things like changes in the orbit of the earth around the sun, changes in ocean currents etc.  Typically these changes occur very slowly over millennia or even millions of years. Then there is the climate change caused by humans.  The main cause of this is the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and CFCs, largely as a result of industrial activity, including industrial-style farming and petroleum-fueled transportation - think cars.   These emissions are already causing rapid warming of the oceans and the atmosphere.  The change is happening so rapidly that the planet does not have time to adapt.  If we do not stop, we will see massive disruption, crop failures, droughts, flooding of all the major cities, wars.  Many analysts believe the very survival of humanity is threatened.

Oh, and Trudeau let the kidnappers fly to Cuba afterward - to party with his buddy Fidel Castro.

Immigration has been the backbone of growth in this country throughout its history.  Many immigrants start new businesses. The immigrants in universities and other professional sectors earn most of the patents that are awarded these days, especially in the research universities.  Most Americans are the descendants of immigrants who would fail Trump's gold-plated test - Trump's own grandfather would not qualify.  Nor would Kellyanne's grandparents, nor would the Mooch's and most other Trump staffers.  The low-skilled labor is also needed. There are already farms in the US who can't get the labor they need to plant and harvest. Low-skilled jobs are not being filled now because of fear of ICE.  Mar a Lago has requested several dozen special visas to fill such rare talent jobs such as housekeeper, bus boy, waiter etc. The hypocrisy reeks.",

They went without lunch. None of the others were aware of their privilege or behaviour ... until afterwards. It was this bishop who told the story - without rancour, with good humour and with forgiveness - what a witness to Christ's grace. \nI repeat this story, not to point fingers at the Anglicans but to illustrate how easy it is to be 'righteous' in our decisions and yet unaware of our own collusion in racism (or any other privileged '-ism'.",

It does not meet any of the above goals. There is no diversity, access is difficult, and it is run like an exclusive private school, funded by taxpayer money. Schools overcrowded? No problem, SIP is capped at 26 students per class. Lack of budget for teachers? Not an issue, SIP has assistant teachers for every class!  \n\nHow is this even compatible with the PPS equity initiative?\n\nMoving the Ainsworth SIP will help meet its true goals, but there is strong resistance to this because it would inconvenience some privileged families that live in the mansions close to the school.",

They were from other parts of our great country where the landowners also owned the mineral rights.

Cowper) sent a letter out to warn about the government spending level and the deficit that we are currently facing today. Nobody headed that early warning.

The broader intention, however, was\nto strengthen the marriage institution among the disciples and align social realities with God's design in creating man and woman. As such, Jesus' prophetic message was an integral part of his proclamation of the kingdom of God and the need to repent and believe the gospel (1:14-15).  \nMark helps us as a people to focus and m a i n t a i n the ideals of married life while dealing with the contingencies associated with the difficulties involved in realizing these in the modern world.

Harper demonstrated that a PM can effectively ignore the role that's in theory reserved for the monarch's representative. Whatever the views of those who opposed the putative coalition that was waiting in the wings at the time, in the most infamous case of Harper's machinations the GG should have insisted that the legislature be convened to decide the government's fate (which interestingly in the method by which BC's Lib government was recently dumped).

Because THE WORD OF GOD DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEED  PRIESTS to be expressed and implemented in our environments. And he insisted very much on the works of mercy.

She has made her sexuality, her cutsie childish promotion, The Kid Came Back, Christy Clark Behind The Smile - also raves about Clark's sex appeal.

Thousands of idiots with no clue as to ethics or hunting regulations who go out and give the tradition a black eye. The last year most of the caribou stayed far away from the road system, enough so that the ADFG issued supplemental tags for a second caribou to try and curb the population to prevent a bust/decline. I love the Denali and Richardson highways and enjoy this hunt, but am dumbfounded about the amount of reckless and unethical actions that are performed while hunting this unit. Last year, watched a group take a dozen pot-shots at a small bull, cow and calf/yearling. We watched them hit all three from what appeared to be 600+ yards, then the animals ran off out of sight. Well the group returned to camp late that night with one animal, and when questioned said \"we missed the others there was no blood trail\". SMH",

The so called competition argument is the real joke here.  It assumes that insurance companies will not collude, will not lobby politicians for their advantage and that the CEO's will quit making tens of millions to pass along savings to their customers.  Medicare for all would actually save us money by using its leverage to negotiate better prices for visits, procedures and prescriptions.

So maybe you did spend 150,000$ in up keep so it can be technically be said ( as is being said in the article ) that you broke even or stretch it out and say that in consideration of up keep you lost money however at the end of the day when yu sell at 250,000$ you are definitely 150,000$ better off than when you bought the house. Bottom line if you can buy a home, buy one. It's a good investment.",

Street “stations” are unnecessary, it’s more like a bus stop. Future capacity can be added with double-deck trams.  Regarding speed, even if light rail is a bit slower than elevated in the few miles from Middle to downtown, it delivers riders more quickly to the urban center (and eventually beyond to UH) rather than to Aloha Tower and the outdated, ridiculous end terminus at our tourist shopping mall that no local needs to reach during rush hour.

They are desperate.\n\nSo, I think this is the beginning of the end of AGDC.  The Legislative Audit staff will make what findings they are told to and be assured that it is already wired that they will find dozens of bad things that Mr. Meyer (not Sen. Meyer) is guilty of.  The kangaroo court audit report will be used by Sen Giesel and Sen MacKinnon to hamstring and sunset AGDC.  LB&A did it to ANGDA 7 years ago and they will do it again here.  The producers are scared that the State's approach to the Pacific LNG market may succeed and they will use their Senate connections to sink AGDC's program before it launches.\n\nGood luck!",

Races that lived in the more moderate or tropical climates had many means of accessing food and the challenges by the weather for shelter was minimal.  The necessity for technology was minimized.  Cultures in climates farther away from the equator had to not only fight for resource but also develop technologies to advance in the harsher conditions.  Seemed pretty interesting.

Returning to Canada for a political coronation certainly didn't work out well for Ignatieff, did it? And Leitch's appeal seems too narrow at this point. But were a populist bilingual leader who pledged to put the interests of ordinary Canadians first and foremost to emerge they might have a very good chance of gaining power.

Dozens of flags are kept in a cup like holder attached to a pole on opposite sides of the street.  After crossing the street, flags are placed back into the cup.  Pedestrians must wave the flag up and down to get the attention of the vehicle drivers while crossing the street.  If  drivers can't notice the waving of a flag than obviously, they're not paying attention or focused to the elements around them while operating a vehicle. The anticipated problem for this excellent safety practice could be that the flags will slowly disappear especially in Hawaii or become frail from the extended use. Hopefully, someone will take the initiative to maintain the flags and replenish the flags in the holders and of course, the citizens of the communities must use the flags for the intended purpose and not run off with it.",

It may be effective for arguing but at the root is just completely wrong.\n======\nI will say this.  Passion, whether religious or environmental, can most certainly lead to huge distortions of fact.    When the issue becomes central to the an individuals sense of self worth, judgement can be seriously out of balance, with emotions overwhelming the rational.   That does not mean they're are the same thing.   Every Soldier is 'conditioned' to fight and die, is militarism a religion?  (they certainly get put together)",

And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”\n\n Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate.\n\nTrump has repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists”, plans to build a border wall & force Mexico to pay for it, repeatedly referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” due to her Cherokee ancestry, called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the US\n\n(cont'd below)....",

Just ask Little Red Services, that abused little Alaska startup that, in ad after ad during the SB-21 debates, told us how they had to move to North Dakota because we taxed too much. They lost their buts in North Dakota, shut that operation down, and sold their company. Giessel, the costs per barrel outside and the costs per barrel on the North Slope are easy to find.

Duncan have led efforts to make it easier to release bad teachers that, presently, notoriously are difficult or impossible to fire. \nTo continue to obsess over school testing while at the same time continuing to seriously underfund schools is counter-productive.\nNot so long ago, Eugene and Corvallis had nation-leading schools--- but this was before Measure 5 and No Child Left Behind.",

That used to be considered a virtue among Christians, you know marriage as a lifetime commitment. Apparently at least with some evangelicals, marriage is now a one way street with the man calmly all the shots, rotten nasty behavior or not. It is like a time zone, back to when women were considered property by rich powerful men.",
