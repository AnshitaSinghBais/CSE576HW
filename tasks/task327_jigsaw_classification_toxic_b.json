Rather they view themselves as temporarily \"down on their luck\" and look up to the rich (Trump-like figures) as role models even though in reality they have almost no chance of emulating them, their lifestyles or wealth especially in the absence of an education.

It's the constant assumption you don't belong or that you're poor/not as smart that is pervasive and infuriating.\n\nThank you Hadiya for tell this story.",

Oil always trumps safety, no pun intended. \nRacial profiling will not work to make us any safer and anyone who says so is a liar! Terrorist organizations are not so stupid as to keep sending young Arab looking Muslim men to do their bidding. They are quite capable of recruiting the blonde and blue-eyed or any other willing body that does not fit the profile. And, the last stat I saw said 78% of terrorist attacks, successful or not were planned and/or committed by American citizens. Trying to pin all terrorist attacks on one group or race is a recipe for disaster. It creates a condition called tunnel vision which means an obvious threat could be ignored because it doesn't fit the profile. Think outside the box!",

It doesn't really matter if the GOP keeps the senate if GOP senators wouldn't repeal Obamacare, insist on building the wall and advance the President's common sense agenda which we vote for. It is more important to get rid of establishment GOP senators than to keep the Senate. At least with Democrats in the majority we know who the enemies are.",

When he was on trial in a Batista courtroom he said famously, \"Convict me it does not matter.

Not because the Inuit peoples have hunted the whales for centuries to sustain themselves, but because YOUR past relatives hunted the whales to near extinction for whale oil, and nothing else.

It is a part of their culture; a culture that has existed for centuries.

This cycle of violence has to end.  \n\nAnd it was most definitely NOT Black Lives Matter that inspired Johnson to kill.  All other press reports say that he was a follower of the group called the African American Defense League, which is on Facebook.

Business people are rational, loosing a house or condo investment no longer becomes a good return if it can be easily taken away by a law suit.

I got there and in a priest's room which is like a 10'x10' room, they have room for a standard size bed and usually a small table and single chair.  We SAT down on the bed and talked sports for approx. 10 minutes, then he put his hand on my knee and started going Up Hill towards my, \"BUSINESS\".  I let a Right Hand \"Knuckle Sandwich\" go to side of his face, knocked him over the bed and knocked him out for 15-20 seconds.  I called my Mom and Dad, we met with the Principal.  (cont.)",

The answer was a resounding - world poverty.\n\nBenedict's first Synod was on the Eucharist with special regard to making the Eucharist more accessible to the poor. Benedict gave the opening address which basically ruled out any discussion on practical measures which would have addressed the issue. One Bishop came up with the reopening of Junior Seminaries!!\n\nIn the end they voted for the status quo. Nothing was done.\n\nThe recent Synod on the Family has seen the opposition to even the slightest change in emphasis and if the conservatives get their way - which they won't - it'll be the status quo again.

Vessels at the port can only be loaded up to 80% capacity due to depth and other restrictions, meaning a vessel can only be filled to around 550,000 barrels. \nAs long as the port can only take Aframax, it will remain largely \"uneconomical\" for exports to head to Asia. Traders said the price of Canadian crude shipped to Asia needs to be low enough to offset the cost of shipping across the Pacific on smaller vessels.\nCrude oil exports to countries other than the U.S. represents only 0.8% of Canada's total crude oil production, around 25,000 b/d on average.",

In the article you wrote: \"The state measure, House Bill 2, known as HB2, was signed into law in March and says the bathroom a person uses is determined by his or her original gender.\" That’s not actually what the law says. I was curious to know what the state’s definition of ‘original gender’ was, so I looked up the bill in question and it doesn’t say ‘original gender’ is says ‘biological sex’, which it defines as: “Biological sex. – The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.”",

Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, has been critical of the current tax system, known as Senate Bill 21 or the More Alaska Production Act (MAPA), since it was first approved in 2013. He said the issue is larger than minimum tax or no minimum tax: the issue is the credits.\n\n“If we’re in the $40 price range for the next 12 to 18 months, we’re going to cripple the treasury for five, six years,” he said.\n\nThat’s because whether or not the state hardens the floor, the credits don’t go away – they’re carried forward into future years. If companies take major losses at low oil prices, they can use that to reduce their taxes for years to come.\n\nStedman said that for all its faults, the previous tax system, called ACES — or Alaska’s Clear and Equitable Share — allowed the state to make up that money if oil bounced back, imposing much higher taxes at high prices. “We can’t afford $35 and $40 per barrel oil. Because we can’t recoup it on the upside to repair it.”",

You should be concerned about PSE's \"Energize Eastside\" project, which is opposed by CENSE, Sierra Club, 350 Eastside, and Protectors of the Salish Sea.\n\nWhy do these organizations oppose a transmission line?  Because PSE's customers will pay more than a billion dollars for this project over its lifetime through higher electricity bills.  Once we commit that amount of money to old technology, there will be no need to invest in smarter technology which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhat are the smarter options?  Demand response and batteries, which can store excess wind and solar electricity.  Instead of firing up a gas plant, batteries can release stored electricity during periods of peak consumption when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.  Batteries would give us better reliability for less money.",

There's a reason this team is ranked preseason #24, despite having top-tier returning talent on offense -- Freeman, Carrington, Griffin, etc. \n\nThe Duck defense, from every analysis I have read, is mediocre at best, not much improved from last season. Equally concerning is the quarterback situation. Prukop, who is as experienced as a college QB could be, only just won the starting job for the season opener over two true freshmen (Wilson, Herbert) and a red-shirt freshman (Jonsen). Herbert, who only joined the team in fall camp won the job as the backup. Duck fans, settle in for an 8-4 record, but look forward to the men's basketball season and a trip to the Final Four!",

Those were known dangers, reported in the handful of media outlets that weren't in the tank for Obama and the Democratic monopoly on power in 2009-10. And yet the CBO came out with a scoring that has proven to be utterly wrong and the supporters of the ACA happily walked off a cliff and took the economy with them.\n\nSo now the ACA has begun to show the strain of being an unsustainable system and needs replacements.

But based on last season and three games into this season, it's becoming clear that Helfrich is just not a head coach. The position requires many abilities: recruiting, player evaluation and development, team organization, managing position coaches and coordinators, and inspire, motivate, and discipline young players in their late teens and early 20s. Helfrich has demonstrated that he is below average in these key areas.",

If it is not fraud, it certainly borders on it.

While we might need some form of priests, in the sense of leading in prayer, etc, we do not need the clerical caste. Many small groups choose their prayer leaders themselves in different ways, and it seems to work well. \n\nIMHO the basic question is what does it mean for me/us in my/our particular circumstances to be a disciple of Christ.

Rather it involves the sanctioning of behaviours that produce this thinking. These behaviours include all actions that deny basic human rights. This is where there is role for the government. For example, in the case of terrorist activity, why does Canada not have a law that makes it a crime to belong to or support a terrorist organization, so the crime can be prevented rather than just reacted to ?

Right now breastfeeding is in, whereas many times in the past it was out.  We should not judge, but rather as a society we should be looking at solutions that provide the best outcomes.

The Medical industry lobbyist have been very good at insuring their representative medical companies have remained free of cost controls.  Germany has a medical system that works, it's an excellent model that insures everyone, includes the private insurers in the process and actually provides better medical care for a lower GDP cost to the taxpayers.

After searching in vain for 120 days for a landlord who will accept Section 8 vouchers, these vouchers expire and tenants have to renter the housing lottery.

Within their countries, none of these women would be considered progressive on women’s rights, minority rights, or LGBTQ rights.\n\nSo, in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and the United States over their entire modern political history there has been a total of only 5 women who have held or are holding the highest political office of their country – 4 elected and 5 conservative/politically right.\n\nSo, perhaps Hillary Clinton is correct, misogyny does play a role in politically left women being elected to the highest office.",

At least that way one wouldn't have to worry about perishing in poverty when one can least help oneself and individuals aren't left to the vagaries of the markets.",

Yes, it's true, the state and local chambers of commerce does not support an income tax. So we have two choices, one protects a business that derives it income from free money-grants, and the other relies on spending by employed individuals.

To be clear, TWU's Community Covenant also denies entry to heterosexuals who do not subscribe to the university's prohibition against sex outside of marriage. \n\nReligious freedom includes the right to be agnostic. Section 2 (a) of the Charter has been interpreted by the SCC to include protection from the imposition by others of religiously motivated sanctions against conduct that is otherwise legal. The covenant infringes therefore on the rights of heterosexuals broadly, and - given the obvious double standard governing premarital sex - discriminates against women in particular. \n\nTWU, of course, claims exemption on the basis it is a private Christian university. What the SCC must decide is whether that exemption compels the legal profession and justice system, which ostensibly stand for fairness and equity, to accept the graduates of a university that openly repudiates those principles.",

There is more water in the air to fuel these deluge storms, creating the downpour, now over 52 inches. Another is sea level rise. The global average is 8 inches, but that's the average. The sea level rise in the Gulf of Mexico in the areas hit by Harvey is higher, \"a good foot,\" according to Hansen.  This additional water vapor fuels the strength of the storm as well as contributes to the unprecedented rain, and the storm is larger and more powerful.\n\nMuch stronger, wetter storms on top of a foot of sea level rise in recent decades have created this particular climate catastrophe.",

The agreement between the governments stipulated that these additional services would only be provided to 'Indian' Bands after the Bands were consulted.\n2. The Federal government did not consult the Bands, and the provincial governments provided the services, one of them being foster/adoptive care of children at risk.\n3. Two written submissions from a Band chief and council member stated ( 49 years after the fact) that if they had been consulted, they would have informed the fostered/adopted children of their parents' culture, and that they would be welcome to come back to the reserve.\n4. Since the children were not informed, this is considered damage.\n\ncontinued..",

Well one thing about republicans, they are good for a few laughs and you can never know where they will end up.  That is why I think it is very possible that they will end up pushing medicare for all.",

These outlays include policing, court and prison costs. Health care and social assistance programs add additional costs of $652 million.The average Washington household headed by a U.S. citizen bears an annual burden of about $970 to cover the costs of the state's illegal alien population.Illegal aliens pay relatively little in taxes because of their low earnings and work in the underground economy. We estimate they pay about $203 million in state and local taxes — 7.4 percent of the estimated burden.",

When it comes to the number of children in foster care on any given day, Alaska was number one. Details here: http://bit.ly/2xRaW8f  There is no evidence that Alaska is the child abuse capital of America. The problems cited as reasons for Alaska’s high rate of tearing apart families, are as or more common in other states that take proportionately fewer children.\n\nNor does Alaska’s obscene rate of removal make children safer.

Where things can go if the technology reaches a point of usability is one thing. What we can do now is another thing. Just because someone claims there is a 200 mpg carburetor, doesn't make it true. Where is all of this technology you speak of? I expect things to be different in 100 years, but I don't expect to be around then. One question I have is what will covering the planet with solar cells or massive wind farms do to the climate?",

There open aggression and violent rhetoric should always be called out, shamed, scorned, and derided by the real decent people who also have the same rights. \n\nThe racists crossed the line from hate speech to violence but in so doing, the found out that supposed \"liberal snowflakes\" will fight back.

Forensic scientists don't grow on trees. They are not lazy government employees ripping you off. Many have accepted a lower wage than they would receive in private employment because they care.",

Rather, the sadness comes from the realization that what we've learned from science since the last such position taken offers church leaders a chance to dig deeper, to expound in more depth, and to take us somewhere new.\n\nHere, the church has a great opportunity to reflect on the nature of death, the soul, and an afterlife.

At the time, it was the promise of a rigorous 14 year training regime that drew me in; today I am convinced the Lord's objective for me was Ignatian spirituality, a form of mystic listening prayer.\n\n Once in the Jesuits, I very quickly acquired a desire to function as a Ukrainian priest, and this was fully supported. It was the reason why I went to NYC for further studies to be near a group of Easter Rite Jesuits, known as the Russian Jesuits. Again total encouragement.

Couple that to substantially increased enrollments at medical, nursing, and dental schools and then we can have universal coverage and truly affordable care.  The ACA itself cannot survive long.  Take a look at the projected budget deficit in Oregon.  A good part of that is due to the expansion of Oregon's medicaid under the ACA, which the feds are no longer paying for.  Obamacare only included heavy federal subsidy until Obama left office.  Convenient?

Then he says that the possibility of an error leading to nuclear war is quite high.\n\nMost of the posters in this thread agree with Toon that nuclear war would result in starvation.\n\nU.S. enemies have made the necessary preparations to insure that their key officials do not starve.\n\nHence the unthinkable may become reality because US enemies may believe they could survive",

The true cost of something is not in the original price. Unless there is a disposal cost, the consumer is making a purchase decision based on an artificially low price. That's an inefficient marketplace. \nWhen we do anything that externalizes the cost of something, we're bypassing pure capitalism. Pollution dumped into our air and water has costs. If you're not paying those costs upfront, someone else is. Pollution kills.\nCertainly we cannot stop all pollution. But we can regulate it. We can make business pay, which passes the cost to consumers. Is one a capitalist if one does not pay the true cost. Maybe it is a kind of theft.

In my opinion, the best way to solve this issue is to discontinue all the various kinds of visas in favour of only one - a 5-year non-renewable immigrant visa. During the five years the immigrant would have to apply for full citizenship, the test for which should include a very tough test of fluency in at least one of our official languages which would make integration almost inevitable.",

However, it is misleading to say the projects were built with no government funding. The public very much subsidized the projects by the waiving of the fees. Which is fine with me as long as there are policies to ensure the affordable units stay affordable. I criticize plenty of professions without having the resources or desire to engage in them. So your claim that everyone should shut up unless they are willing to become a developer is weak. Are you an elected official? If not, do you think you still have the right to criticize someone who is? Do you refrain from taking issue with all CB articles because you are not a professional journalist?",

Obama care did not include a public or cooperative option. We're told it couldnt get thru Congress, but I suspect a bit more lobbying of the 218 congress reps who eventually voted in favor might have helped. Obama Care became a welfare program for the private insurance industry, with the taxpayer guaranteeing private insurance profits,  insuring them against any losses in providing coverage, and with all the bureauracy and extra costs of private insurance legislated into place.

Many millions of these prescriptions are written each year without, apparently, resulting in criminal acts.
