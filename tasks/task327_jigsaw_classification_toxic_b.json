His argument is that this would accurately reflect the political sentiment of Canadians is absolute bunk.  PR is a fall back to weather a political backlash of the Canadian voter. His Party has never come close to achieving victory at the federal level- a crystal clear message to Broadbent and his like- minded they have to make the change, not the electoral system.\nBroadbent parrots a leftist perspective that the only legitimate election result is a left-liberal outcome. This is reflective in his demeaning of the November election in the U.S..  In this election, the  Democrats rested on their polls and favourable news clippings.  With that assurance, registered Democrats did not  show up to vote.  They lost the election because of this.  Their stupidity, arrogance, and assumptions were not rewarded.\nDemocracy holds political governance accountable!",

The GOP controlled Senate voted to do the PFD restructuring while refusing to consider the repeal of an equal amount in subsidies to the oil industry proposed by the Governor. The legislature refused to do the one job it is constitutionally mandated to do out of cowardice. The governor put forth a complete plan at great political cost.

When I hear of parents keeping their kids indoors the whole time while gangsters brazenly walk the streets with guns that apparently come from a seriously undermanned police station, I can completely understand them being gatvol. It looks like they've finally cracked and resorted to demonstrating, like the Masi people always do. I hope it brings some urgent attention from the authorities, but I won't hold my breath because even the Cape City Council seem blinded by the need to be 'pro-poor' but only interpret that as meaning 'black', not 'coloured'.",

When the democratic party ousted Sanders the working poor and the young graduates with huge debts and no jobs were left with little choice but to vote for a racist, narcissi clown like Trump. As the neoliberal economic system created more inequality with all the GDP gains going to the top 5% over the last 8 years, the tremendous increase in inequality, and the working poor increasing in numbers there comes a point where they will revolt, just like the Germans did who voted Hitler into power.

But never has there been one so disrespectful of people, devoid of common decency and so disrespectful of the traditions that have held American democracy together, especially willingness to accept our differences.\n\nIt's not unreasonable to label this behavior evil, both in moral and functional terms.

This was not a Muslim ban, as there are at least 40 other countries with Muslim majorities, inhabited by the 90% of world wide Muslims. These countries were originally cited by Obama.  And what you say about illegal aliens turning in others because they have no fear of being deported is garbage. Prove it .Obama said he would withhold Federal funds for States not following his \"bathroom\" rules. Where was your outcry? It's not racism. its safety.  How many more Americans are you willing to harm by protecting criminal illegal aliens?   Who in your family are you willing to sacrifice?",

He knew well, and was known by, all of the prominent political figures of his day.  And, in office, Jackson displayed a deep grasp of the Constitution and a determination to defend it against the growing possibility of secession.\n\nNone of this, of course, is true of Trump, who never served in the armed forces, never served in (or even ran for) public office, and apparently doesn't even pay income taxes.  Trump has never shown the slightest interest in the Constitution.

Once was a news conference where he produced a copy of his birth certificate to dismiss the silly rumour and the second was the White House Correspondent's dinner where Trump was present where he demonstrated Trump's silliness in front of him.  He had the temperament and self-discipline to not respond all the time to silly issues.\nTrump could solve most of his so called media issues by not tweeting and stop criticizing people",

So with that, throughout history (from scientific data), CO2 ppm in the atmosphere never exceeded 300 ppm. NEVER. There were natural changes in the climate and the natural world flowed with itself, different events causing different warming and cooling trends. However, since man and industrialization came along we have not only exceeded 300ppm, we skyrocketed CO2 concentration to above 400ppm in a timeframe unprecedented by any increase in history. This contributes directly to the Greenhouse Effect, but maybe you dispute that too, I'm not sure how crazy you really are. In case you need a refresher on the effect, here's a quick and easy Wiki:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect",

It seems for less money we could make the road a bit safer.  We just returned from UK and did extensive driving there - they use cameras - when you approach an area with camera surveillance there is a notification sign letting drivers know and if you have a gps in your car it notifies you and posts the speed limit.  We were told the cameras work well and tickets are issued and that it frees up law enforcement for more important issues.    As for another gravel quarry, our state is becoming ever increasingly a tourist destination and the Seward Hwy drive is considered one of the most beautiful in the world.

There is a curfew for children 16 and under.  If the police see them out after curfew, stop them and pat them down for police safety. If they find drugs or firearms, arrest them and charge them for the crime. Instead of more gun laws, enforce the ones we have. Make the weapons charge the main charge and plea bargain all you want for the other charges. \n\nWhere this becomes politically divided is when Republicans want strict enforcement and accountability and Democrats want to treat the reason for these kids being out there.

Taxes are the peoples money that we permit the government to use. Those taxes are coming from the same riders that ride the rail as well as those that do not ride it.\nThe original stated goal of the rail, 12 years ago, was to get more cars off the streets. the only way to accomplish that is to make the incentive for riding it a no brainer.  If it is free to ride and is fully subsidized, then the ridership will get more cars off the street.  it is already subsidized about 85%. screw that last 15 %, just do it 100% and stop pissing around. It will save probably 50% of that in the actual act of collecting the fairs to begin with. Do you know how much one of the cash collection boxes is on the bus ?",

Clinton's lawyers and aides deleted almost 30,000 emails -- and wiped their hard drives -- before turning the rest over to investigators. They claimed that these 30,000 were not work-related.

The current incumbents have by in large- with a few notable exceptions have not even so much as given lip service to publicly funding elections.  That needs to change, and it will probably come through Internet small dollar fundraising, grassroots campaign volunteers, and a lot of hard work by committed candidates.\n\nThat's my best guess anyway.

If I'd gone to the hospital emergency room it would have been, from experience, at least $700, may have involved surgery and then hospitalization for days, costing several thousand more. He's a good person and doesn't deserve this public castigation. He probably kept prescribing because suffering people kept asking him for help.

Hitler awarded Ford Germany's highest civilian medal for the help he provided in building up their military.  Ford & GM both had truck factories operating in Germany throughout the war. George Herbert Walker (Bush 41's dad) was convicted of trading with the enemy, even after the war started.

These actions are called sins and God hates them, not because He arbitrarily doesn't like them, but because they harm our souls to the point that when we die, our souls will not be able to withstand the Fire of God's Love (you read about the burning fire of God in scripture and other spiritual writers). God hates these sins because they destroy our souls and He desires for ALL of us to be with Him for all eternity. But due to His own nature which He cannot change, grave sin-which is not subjective or arbitrary-keeps the human beings that He loves so much, from being able to withstand being in His presence when they die.",

In other words they are too influenced by secularism.  Church is something done on Sunday's if at all.  Faith is not who a person is, it is not a way of life, it is what one does when one has time, if one feels like it.  The commandments are taken as mere suggestions.  A person's image of Jesus is something analogous to a hippie, a nice guy, Santa Clause, a social justice warrior, Karl Marx, all rolled into one.  Church teaching can be summarily dismissed when one does not like what the teaching says--except of course when the Church talks about helping the poor or using green technology.\n\nUntil that problem is addressed, I don't think a married clergy is going to solve anything.",

What's their reason for the team's sloppy performance? Maybe too much is expected from the new coach, but after the previous coaches tenure, fans are looking for a much better performance; at least a team that's fun to watch.

Actually, I don't know anyone that has those three qualities that plans otherwise.\n\nPlease don't sit this out. Go to at least one Trump rally and tell them what you really think.\n\n-- Paul",

HART has a budget of $250,000, they could pay for it or better yet the FTA. AuditTheRail petition is to prove that thousands of people of Hawaii would like a forensic audit, and with that they can go to the Federal Government and say \"The People of Hawaii are Demanding a Forensic Audit before anymore money is released for the Rail Project.\" Then and only then can we move on to more money poured into this mess!",

Started with sex, then drugs! I desecrated Jesus' body by receiving Him in the Holy Eucharist unclean (not in the State of Grace). I want my conscience to alert me. I believe my conscience was deadened by each sexual act I wrongly committed against our Heavenly Father. I also say, \"Jesus, help me to be more and more humble and help me to remain strong in my faith.\" In other words, Kevin, I am asking Jesus to be my guide. I do not want to be guided by the way society, our world and  popular opinion try to sway/lead people. Kevin, going to Confession regularly (at least once every three months, can be more often when I have offended God and my neighbor) and this helps me. (continued)",

It can then be made to surrender that energy by combining it with oxygen. Several car companies are already making hydrogen-fueled cars. The trick for success will be to produce both economical and durable fuel cells, and compact and economical storage devices. My point was that, with sufficient investment in research, we could likely achieve these objectives. Maybe by not flushing away trillions of dollars, and sacrificing the lives or health of hundreds of thousands of soldiers in stupid and futile wars, we could be there by now.

Author Michael Connelly was a crime reporter with LA Times for years. He was trusted by both the public--and the police.

His books usually include acknowledgement pages, and list those in police and the legal sector--and other sectors as well--who help in his research and vetting his manuscripts.  \n\nThat's why.

Jesus salvific act not quite up to snuff ?\nExperience teaches us that everybody is not yet confirmed in grace .  \nOur darkness , weakness and propensity to do wrong still exists .  In other words it can be phrased that the false self has not yet been wholly healed .  The true self is being healed but we are not living from our true self all the time .   Nor are we our true selves yet !  This has very little to do with catechesis , knowledge etc . \nWe struggle to dispose ourselves to opening to the work that only God can and wants to do :  make us whole .",

As I review our oil period, I remember those years and the rush to cement a deal at the time of the North Slope discovery. Those few years forever determined the outcome of this strange deal between producers and the state of Alaska. We can't undo that time period.\n\nThings are different now. The oil embargo of the 1970s and the accompanying price hike brought production to places where it had not been before: those places (like Alaska), now feed their populations with the profits from oil; they ca't stop producing. This is one of the main factors the market is realizing.\n\nEven if we get short run increases in income from restructuring taxes, in the long run, we will still run short. In my view we need to learn to live within our means. When people begin paying a tax, waste will become a visible issue. We are in for many changes in our old age, I\"m afraid.",

The real decision makers are not the reports that present the news, it's management and ownership(if active), that set the parameters of what get's printed.\n\nJonah makes the same mistake by the way.   I don't read all of his columns, but I don't ever remember seeing him write about the most watched cable news broadcast in the country, Fox.   Maybe not a good time to bring it up, but Ailes fall from grace has exposed a very seedy underbelly of Fox that no doubt affected who they hired, how they chose to 'sell/market' their news and what got broadcast.

As a result it was setup as a Ponzi scheme that was doomed to failure.\n\nIt wasn't until the mid 1990's that CPP was completely reformed, with much higher contribution rates, that people began not only paying for their own CPP, but also covering off the massive shortfall left for the first 30 years that CPP existed.  We still have another 15 to 20 years to go to pay off that deficit, after which the system will be more or less equitable.",

I have seen this numbers thing repeatedly expressed on this website.  It's why Trump can't get past his poll ratings and the number of people who attend his rallies. Montana is facing a disaster if we can't convince the GOP members of the legislature they need to convene a special session to deal with a monstrous budget shortfall because of the worst fire season the State has ever seen.

Quite unconscionably the Bank of Canada has no mandated core inflation measure we can look at following the dysfunctional renewal of its inflation control agreement .

Victor Doyle (see article last week), try to convince us that the Green Belt is not affecting prices, common sense and unbiased analysis proves otherwise.  I do not support scrapping the Green Belt, but only recognize that it does have an impact.\nLow interest rates were the instigator of soaring housing prices in Toronto.  In a well functioning market, new houses would have been build to satisfy this demand and there would have been a modest increase in real prices.\nBut, we don't have a well functioning market.  We have a highly regulated market where the time from development proposal to actual building of homes can take 10 years.  Hence, the modest increase in demand led to soaring prices as serious shortages of houses emerged.",
