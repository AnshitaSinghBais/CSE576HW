I arrived at this by comparing the theoretical total pension paid for two years (24 months) between ages 68 & 70 and the 16.8% (24 mos. x 0.7%) increase in payments if you wait until age 70 to collect. It will take you almost 12 years to recoup the 2 years of foregone CPP payments with the increase you'll get at age 70. I'd suggest that if you don't need the money, take the pension at age 68 then save and invest it in a TFSA which will supply you with a tax-free pool of capital that you can use for whatever you choose. \n\nAnother reason to begin collecting CPP earlier rather than later is taxation. If you anticipate other forms of income increasing as you age, delayed CPP payments will incur higher income taxes.

If there was no insurance, a lot of people would not get a mortgage and not own a home (not the home they bought anyway).\n\nI think the government recognizes that they have been subsidizing the bank's business.  Have a look at the Twitter post below, which shows the actual rates for insurance. The 'increase' may look small, but it is actually the lower leverage mortgages that experience the biggest increase in mortgage insurance rate.   Banks have been using CMHC insurance to reduce the cost of their own borrowing, even for mortgages below 20% leverage. It will cost them a lot more with this change to continue the practice.\n\nThe government has also mused about having a 'deductable' where the bank eats part of any loss. A less likely outcome after these increases.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/i/web/status/821349107268784129",

That's quite remarkable for the industry. Its Alaskan management , past and current, are concerned about assuring ethical operations and running a safe facility. GEO and CCA lobbied against the passage of PREA in Congress.",

I would suggest that this is due, in large part, to the very low level of bilingualism among non-francophones in ROC and that that low level is inevitable given lack of viable opportunity/need for these groups to use French.

There was a program of separate development which had the desire, at least initially, of being to the benefit of ALL groups.

I was taking about the Aristotelean soul from the De Anima, which is a precisely a rejection of the cartesian \"Ghost in the Machine.\" The soul is not the brain. It is the principle of activity and organization of the body, nothing more. The psyche is at a level bellow the intellect but above the organic. It would be analogous to what Aristotle calls the \"irrational soul.\" So its not entirely in the brain, but it emerges from the brain. Bernard Lonergan explain this all quite well in Insight. It does seem evident to me that transgenderism is a problem with the psyche that should be treated psychologically, opposed to fundamentally altering the body.",

Basically he describes 3 types of Alzheimer's:\n1) amyloid formed in response to inflammation or infection Lyme, spirochetes and molds are some.  Inflammation can be caused by high sugar diet and poor oral hygiene.\n2) withdrawal of \"neuro-trophic support\" (stuff that helps the brain repair itself) such as estrogen, testosterone, Vitamin D, nerve growth factor -- and more -- which support making new brain cells. \n3) the hardest to treat: heavy metal toxicity, often from eating farmed fish.  Stick to the SMASH fish: salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring.\nFor the reversal protocol see my website under the NEWS tab: www.DrEmilyKane.com",

When oil companies own the pipelines they will discourage competition in gas developement by high tariffs and restrictions. We want space available for everybody that wants to produce, which is an insurance policy to keep the line full and at a sustainable tariff. That is why I think the Governor wanted to increase the pipeline size not to just receive gas from the Big Three. Also, consider the stranded gas in the Mackenzie Delta, Canada, 200 miles from PT.Thompson or the gas in British Columbia that they can't get to market. I am betting on the Governor to make a Cash Cow out of owning the AKLNG. Makes sense to me.",

To give the letter a name, let alone one that references John Paul II's apostolic letter on clergy formation, is more than a little too much hubris.  When I worked for a bishop in the 1990s he would pass around letters that he received from people that where similar to this one: multiple pages with bolded and underlined phrases.  The people who sent them came across as unhinged.  (Now they just blog.)  Quite frankly, it shocks me someone in the archdiocese didn't see this and question whether this was the best format.  Dolan, who probably didn't write the letter (something else you learn when you work for a bishop), should have heavily edited it.  He really isn't that ignorant. \n\nFinally, Dolan is a student of history.  He knows that American Catholicism is congregational.  Not just the last 50 years, but from its inception.  This crazy letter won't help the effort to undo it.",

I am more concerned what he will do to the morale of the team by being back in the locker room.\n\nAt first, I was upset about Sloter situation but after thinking about it a few days I think Elway did him a favor. Sloter was never going to make it in Denver. Not because of his talent but because I think he has what it takes to be a good quarterback in this league, but because I think the Elway and company just saw him as bastard child and a extra arm in camp and had peg him as that no matter what. Next year he was not going to stand a chance with Lynch and Kelly in the mix. Now he has a fighting chance to make it with the Vikings.",

All he had to do was to give his wife a writ---and she was history.  If her father was still alive--she could ask to come home---but he didn't have to admit her.  And if he did, he could beat her for bringing shame to the family name.  Most women had to resort to prostitution to survive.  Jesus was very much aware of this.\nToday, women have much more to say about divorce---but that still doesn't eradicate the heart-ache, and mental distress many people endure.

It was their politicians who stole the money and left the country bankrupt in the false belief that they would always have growth, and now, many of the same people who have been gaming the system for years are back in control (i.e. Goldman Sachs etc).

The reform succeeded at much, but obviously, patriarchy and discrimination are still with us, as are gender roles. The Roman Catholic priesthood, which was unknown among the early Paulists, may be related to the celibate/castrating Galli priests of Rome and Turkey who dressed like women. The Paulists envisioned a holy community that was 'neither male nor female,' and a 'priesthood of all believers,' and a Christ whose members were both male and female, and 'one baptism.'

This state is getting smaller and smaller every year and a trapping ban may just start with Crevasse Moraine, but where does it end?  I have no doubt the good people of the trails association and the trappers association can come to an agreement if they sat down together.\n\nAdditionally, does anyone know where to get an electronic copy of the above mentioned master plan?

What is amazing is how many employees are staffed at our Honolulu Airport and they can't manage to renovate the airport in an efficient manner? Typical government solution. The airport staff is inefficient so let's make another department and hire more people. How about just getting them to do what they are suppose to do?",

It's actions like this that alienated the voters of America who were so sick and tired of politics as usual that when given the option of voting for a non-politician like Trump, even with a lot of warning flags, people voted for him.   The result was a message to the two main political parties that America is tired of politics as usual, elected officials representing lobby's and not the voters, and frustrated with being treated like dumb sheep. Traini's days, like Don Young's, are numbered while Dunbar is going to start reaping the votes.",

Reed was happy to see them sweep away Kerensky's democratic collection of Socialists and Cadets, which he felt was too disorganized to fight off a Right-Wing Counter Coup.  \nWhat Reed failed to see in time were the Bolsheviks' own bad features, their brutality and authoritarianism.  As Reed died prematurely in Russia in 1920 we'll never know if he'd have turned against Lenin.\nAnd WE need a passion and vision if we are to preserve democracy today.",

There would be a lot of merit in an internationally monitored referendum on Kosovo of the kind former Kenyan citizen Barack Obama delusionally claimed had been carried out. It might lead to northern Kosovo returning to Serbia and the rest of Kosovo uniting with Albania. Kosovo is not a logical country; it is more a US military base with a country attached to it. However worthy such an initiative will be, I doubt it will proceed on Trump's watch. It would be tangential to US interests, and he has more pressing things to worry about.",

Moreover, he is publicly labelled a felon for life with no chance for redemption to record-free status and relegated via \"background checks\" to menial jobs for life.  You don't hear the liberals complaining about this system or work to change it to one in which rehabilitation and redemption is the focus.

So why do so many women refuse to take the proper precautions before engaging in activities that can get them PG ? Are they that thoughtless or powerless to protect themselves given the obvious risk ?  I realize it takes two to tango , but men don't get PG . The burden of protecting they're bodies is on the women , since the result is put on their shoulders.  Liberals are screaming to cut military spending.

With isolated reserves of 2,000 or less scattered far from  small cities with decent healthcare, schooling, it makes more sense to relocate to these cities & beef up services here (ie. Wpg, Thunder Bay,Timmins). Better internet connection is a Trudeau prospect but I suspect the increase in youth suicides is due to youth awareness of opportunities in the south.

They've layered on the promises that they would do in on Day One, that they would do it simultaneously and seamlessly (no gap between repeal and replace), that they would insure every one, that they would do it for for less money and provide better care. \nThey lied. For seven years, they lied. They could have been working with President Obama and the Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act, but they did everything in their power to undermine it. Still, after a rocky start and despite the best efforts of the obstructionists, the ACA has extended health insurance to millions of people who didn't have it and improved the health and well-being of millions more. The roll-out of the farcical health care act yesterday, and the reaction to it, demonstrates the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of Trump and the GOP",

As a matter of fact fully automatic versions (i.e. machine guns), which are true military grade rifles, were readily available to the general public until 1986 and background checks on firearm transfers weren’t required until 1994 - yet nobody talks about mass shootings with any version (semi-automatic or automatic) of these guns during the 40’s, 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s so it’s a relatively new phenomenon and logic would indicate it’s being caused by something else",

This is added to the high cost of living in Alaska which means a high opportunity cost for young people/families when compared to other parts of the country and suddenly these rates of emigration seem almost surprisingly low.\n\nI have to disagree with your assumption that UAA has no identity.

The Chinese dominated Vietnam for over a century, as they now dominate Tibet. Arabs, Berbers, and Turks dominated much of southern Europe for centuries.

The accusation arose after a 12 month period when I made 17 trades and approx. $17,000. The letter simply demanded additional taxes as I was not making capital gains income but was deriving my bread and butter from trading and therefore a professional trader, income from investment to be taxed at the the regular income tax rate. They refused to provide any guideline for what day trading is by their definition, what the limits are in terms of market activity and where I crossed their invisible line. They also failed to supply any point of contact to allow appeal of or clarification of what they were doing - it simply felt like a tax grab to me, targeting the lowest common denominator on the tax roles, the wage earner.

Any tax, according to Article 9 Section 6 has to be for a \"public purpose\". Re-distributing income does not meet this test. The IRS taxes us on the Dividend because it is \"income\" and not a tax-exempt government benefit.\nIt is incredible to me that the Democratic (79% voted for Bernie Sanders) Party operatives want a big government, government giveaways for no legitimate public purpose, and a tax on hard working Alaskans to enable funding to do it.\nThis all reminds me of the Zobel case, where greed and mob mentality created the original dividend law which was struck down in both the State Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court.
