If they had an emergency at altitude, they should have had time to at least issue a mayday.

The ultimate \"gimme\" would be the engagement/wedding ring trade off.  Without it...no sex at all.  This behaviour can be seen to be encouraged--or aided and abetted--by a society that traditionally gave women no other real power except what they took for themselves in bedrooms.",

I also didn't get notices when Chugach via Carlos Tree Services would be cutting trees. We had 2 pit bulls in the backyard and my kids and I were home.

Unfortunately some of those children are committing a disproportionate amount of the violence and their community is so distrustful of law enforcement and \"the establishment\" in general that they stay silent and refuse to get involved. And with good reasons (in my opinion). So while you are screeching about racism because I pointed out the situation, THEIR CHILDREN ARE KILLING AND DYING! Imagine how the parents feel after going through so much to get their kids to a \"safer\" place. You think that you're defending them? You're not. You're perpetuating their pain. Well done. I have to wonder if your cries of racism are actually attempts to mask your own.",

In that order are the 3 largest recipients of our PFD deposits.\nI admit our family's PFD's went to foolhardy expenses such as college and orthodontics, but darn it, how do we replace the $8 billion/yr that used to gush out of the ground? No gold revenues, no fish fees, no lumber surcharges, no sales/income taxes, no Raid on the Permanent Fund will ever replace that. If we skim $8 billion/yr from the Perm Fund it'll be drained in 7 years. Skimming 3% saves the corpus, yet starves the poor IRS, CSED and Muni/Courts.",

The revisionists have developed a \"New Chronology\" which brings the biblical accounts forward by several hundred years. Proponents of the New Chronology maintain that this new timeline removes the basis for skepticism concerning the Hebrews in Egypt and their subsequent Exodus.  Naturally, the academic establishment has pushed back.  Until there is unequivocal proof that the Hebrews were not in Egypt, I choose to accept the Biblical account of Joseph, Moses and the flight from Egypt.",

And then there is the fact that government does not create jobs by robbing Peter to pay Paul, and if businesses do not prosper, neither do the citizens. The government role is to create conditions for economic growth, and high corporate taxes are a great idea for Liberals who know that budgets take care of themselves and any amount of borrowing to divide and conquer the electorate is a no lose proposition.

So Fancis is making a mistake in associating these theorists with the transgendered.\nWhat is needed is some way to define male and female that works for everyone. Good luck with that. Gender dysphoria is a good step, but inadequate because it does not define what it is about the ‘male’ that a “female” wants to be, or the ‘female’ that a “male” thinks she is.

The chance to view critters in their natural environment aligns the wildlife viewing (non-eaters) constituency with the hunting constituency in support of political and financial habitat preservation efforts.  Efforts like this saved the Mississippi flyway.\n\nFish are very different.  With the exception of spawning salmon, they are not easily observable, they don't have big brown eyes, and they don't bear adorable young.  In short, far fewer non-eaters are going to rally to support efforts to preserve their habitat.  The practical result would be more development in riparian areas and much looser regulations on water use and quality.  \n\nSo I hear what you're saying, but fear you'd be dooming the very fish you seek to protect.  There's a lot of good gravel in the Kenai River and Paxon Lake, and the DOT has a lot of projects . . . .",

I can't speak for provincial or municipal police forces, but the RCMP has a non-discretionary policy of requiring no-alcohol conditions in every case in which alcohol was involved.\n\nThis needs to change. In general, bail orders should not have no-alcohol conditions, and there should be clear directions from the appropriate cabinet ministers to all police and prosecutors not to ask for them. In those cases where alcohol is clearly an issue, courts will often impose a condition that \"you must not be found outside your residence under the influence of alcohol\".

Prisons to road maintenance, you name it. Most not attractive or glamorous. Many jobs go undone because of inability to hire enough staff. Why do people take these jobs? One of the big reasons is the retirement package. Historically it has been looked at as deferred compensation. Why? In the case of licensed electricians, the pay scale is at least ten dollars per hour below scale. Kill the retirement carrot and Colorado is headed for big, big problems. Qualified applicants will simply not apply. Then what you gonna do? Call ghost busters?",

I am an American of Irish descent, and I appreciate the de-anglicization of place names in Ireland and the regrowth of the Irish language there. But, let's recognize that the domination of one culture over another is not unique to the Americas and not unique to the time of European dominance in world affairs. The Chinese dominated Vietnam for over a century, as they now dominate Tibet. Arabs, Berbers, and Turks dominated much of southern Europe for centuries. There are many, many more examples of the same. In fact, the view that only Europeans and their descendants engage in cultural domination is itself a result of ethnocentrism and its dehumanizing \"noble savage\" fantasy.",

Also, his initiatives regarding taxes, infrastructure projects, monetary policy, overreaching regulations, immigration, military, diplomatic, informational, and all the other routine federal govt functions are moving forward.  Many are just not hearing about it.  Hmmm....does not reporting on it equate to it not happening?  The biggest (for me) issue that will occupy a LOT of our President's time over the next 2 years is to reprioritize govt spending; to include cutting back on, or elimination all together of those agencies that were grown during the last admin, which really was a power grab.  It, in effect, placed leftists in our governmental agencies that make our country run.  Laugh if you want, but you can see it every day if one chooses to see it.  DOS?!...FUHGETABOUTIT!

Using this test, one can can clearly establish that those who exceed the speed limit are more likely to cause accidents that could physically and demonstrably harm others.

The downhole pressure anywhere in the 500 sq mile basin will vary considerably due to incredible geologic forces. Generally, we can estimate reservoir pressure by dividing in half the length of a typical 8 5/8ths casing. So 10,000' well would have around 5,000 lbs of downhole pressure, and when that gets depleted, recovery starts to go down rapidly. The tar pits are a surface expression, just like when Col Hancock had a lake of oil in his lower 40 before mid Wilshire was developed. However, wells in Rosecrans go down easily to 10,000'. Remember, the LA Basin has over 27,000' of sandstone depositions that were sourced by nodular shale real deep. It is also considered to have more oil per square meter than any other basin on the planet. Back to your comment, while some fields have been pressure depleted, that does not mean there is no significant pressures still.",

It looks to me that if the price is currently being driven by the futures market as you indicate, than this means that we should eventually see the price of oil increase to reflect supply/demand balance.  The investment in production has been much lower the past 2 years as the price of oil has been declining.  Eventually this will have a large impact on world production and with demand on a steady but slow upward climb, inventories will drop.  I see US shale being able to fill some of this void with fairly quick turnaround, but it won't be able to make up all production that is being lost, especially in those long time frame and expensive deep water wells.\n\nThis seems to me like a good opportunity to pick up some solid low cost, well financed producers that have seen stock prices driven down due to concern about the recent drop in oil prices.",

It really bothers me when someone claims to know all the answers, and starts to tell you what you should be outraged about.",

Corporate tax rates were significantly reduced by previous conservatives, resulting in many individuals setting up CCPC's for \"businesses\" for tax benefits only.

MP's, university professors, some IT employees) set up corporations for  \"side\" businesses (ie speaking engagements, contract work on the side). Where is the business risk in this?  These income streams should be reported as other income/sole proprietorship income on the T1 return.

Sure, Trudeau takes selfies and attends the Pride parade while Harper didn’t.   Doesn’t affect me from day to day.  From what I can tell, their style may be different but the substance is the same.\n\nThis shouldn’t really come as a surprise either when you consider that the people who provide the most significant financial support to both parties are the same.  The $1000/plate fundraising dinner of either party is attended by the same people.  So clearly the policies of both parties must ensure that these donors remain pleased. \n\nI find it odd how Liberals and Conservatives supporters can seemingly dislike each other so much when the most important policies of the two parties are nearly identical.\n\nLiberals = Conservatives",

It is foolish to have four separate provinces in the east. Yes, loyalties to provinces run deep there, but it would make sense if leaders in those provinces would at least begin to consider some sharing of services, if not outright amalgamation.

As 67% of federal spending is on entitlement programs decreasing spending must consider these federal programs.\n.\nIf somehow both could be accomplished and (miracle!) an annual federal surplus of $500 billion was achieved, it would take more than 40 years to pay down the national debt.\n.\nFairness should be less of a priority than reality.",

Well, what little education you need to work in sweat shops and when we are done with grown up complaints we will reinstate child labor.

This culture pushes pilots to take unnecessary risks.\n\nI was on a Grant flight 3 weeks ago trying to reach our destination ahead of storm, even though we were only a couple miles out from our destination we turned back when the local AWOS started reporting winds over minimums.  When I got to my destination the next day I was talking to some folks who it turned out landed on a Hageland flight that flew into the storm shortly after we turned back.  They told me that the landing was hairy and then the pilot refused to taxi on to the apron for fear of turning his aircraft into a sustained high crosswind, he dumped passengers and gear at the runway exit and made a rapid departure .

Later on the Italians, Poles and others added to Catholic numbers and this is when the province paid Catholic School Boards roughly 50% of the cost with the other 50% being collected from Catholic residents and businesses as local taxes. At one time the thought of Catholics attending the established schools was much the same as in the American South  where segregation was looked upon as being the way God wanted it. \nOrganised religion is in decline and in the Public Schools the climate in the classrooms toward religion is quite frigid.

On another play the Cardinals had a runner break towards third and for some reason Wolters held the ball way too long and by the time he finally threw it the runner was safe.\n\nI agree the Rox need a another quality RH arm in the bullpen that can be trusted in high leverage situations, but they also need to seriously think about upgrading the catcher position (would be almost anyone other than Wolters) if the cost is reasonable.",

What they do not acknowledge is that, based on their own orthodox reasoning, such a state only applies under 3 conditions: 1) grave or serious matter (tick); 2) full knowledge of what they are doing (maybe tick); and 3) full consent of the will. The whole point of the AL footnote is to address those whose lives are in a murky mess: extricating themselves from their relationship and/or living a brother-sister relationship is very complicated if not infeasible. There is no full consent of the will. By traditional standards of reasoning, communion is valid in such cases.",

As for Specialist MD's, their incomes reflect years of additional study, additional risk, and a supply and demand problem compared to yours. Who caused that? The medical associations! Why single out Radiologists? Jealous? What about retina surgeons?

The Anchorage School District spends a whopping $16,000 per student per year and is never satisfied with how much money they get. And then there is REVENUE SHARING.

Tribes already have specific rights in CINA cases because of the ICWA law (Indian Child Welfare Act). In addition to that, two tribes recently applied for and received agreement for certain parcels of their land to be put into/under Federal Trust. That land will be under Federal/tribal jurisdiction.
