The Leftist filth have no problem morally equivocating and making excuses for Jihadis and Islam or any other Third World (read non-White European) revolutionaries, and are incessantly lecturing us on how we should \"better understand\" them. Yet there is no desire or attempt by the Leftist media, academia, or political elites to better understand the complicated history and personalities of slavery in America and the diverse viewpoints that led Southerners to rebel and secede.  Robert E. Lee is revered for the fact he was a man of honor and integrity who came to his decision to resign from the US Army and defend his state after long and hard moral deliberations. He was so respected by all of America, that he was offered command of the US/Union Army. Leftist attempt to portray him as some kind of Hollywood cliche \"slaveowner\" is repulsive to historical fact.",

Rule #3 if said bullying doesn't end than knock them on their ar*se! I might get some hate for the above but it really does work. \nThis article has.. unbelievable, so heartbreaking..",

The educated negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him.\"",

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

If he is not being honest about the situation, he will only be dishonest again.  Figure it out for yourself.\n\nMost people who have actually gotten away from a \"crazy\" ex do not encourage the crazies by keeping a facebook page or anything else showing a continuing relationship, especially if they have concerns.

The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA.

See sales tax, income tax, propert tax are all deductible from your federal taxes. Ie more of your federal dollars stay here in Alaska, instead of going to Washington. The pfd would basically offset the state taxes, and you'd get a deduction from your federal taxes. It would be like living anywhere else in the US except it's offset by the pfd. I'd be all for this, so long as a spending cap were created and the tax rates were adjusted to decrease / go away when the reserve is at a surplus. Ie 90 day reserve is maintained. Right now we have a 3 year reserve (significantly the highest in the US). Including state & muni taxes, we have the lowest tax burden in the US.",

My impression is that they've all been running too hot, which would indicate less actual sensitivity to CO2 than modeled.\n\nPatrick Frank wrote that paper in Skeptic a few years back about climate models where he seemed to show that the radiative effect due to the average annual cloud error in GCMs was about equal to the entire radiative effect of anthropogenic CO2 since the start of the Industrial Revolution, rendering model predictions worthless even a few years out.  Any thoughts on that?",

Count-up how many cats are in a 20-30 mile radius region, 40-60 miles in diameter from ground-zero, (though many cats can migrate far further than that in the 4 months it takes for a cat to become reproductive), then sterilize 85%-95% of them in under that 4 month time-frame.

You would be stuck with the preexisting population counts into eternity if you don't sterilize more than that even faster than that.

Finally, the entire system is so dysfunctional that, yes, the constitution needs to be amended to remove the electoral college. Four times in the history of this country someone has won the real election but lost the electoral vote. In each case, by the way, the popular vote went to a liberal but the electoral vote was for a conservative (again read the history of the electoral college).\n\nNo patriotic American (defenders of Truth, Justice and Democracy) should be in favor of an oligarchical system in which 304 people decide the outcome of the Presidential election.",

Gordon Campbell structured it to fail. The foreign buyers tax and other changes to  the laws around property probably will lead to a compromise that is somewhere between the Green and the Liberal position.

Women need to know that in Canada, women who attend screening mammography are 40% less likely to die of breast cancer than women who do not. Mammography is not perfect, and is particularly weak in women with dense breasts. These women can benefit by supplementary breast ultrasound: in addition to, NOT instead of mammography. In these women, ultrasound can double the cancer detection rate, and finds small, invasive, node negative cancers that are missed on mammograms and are still too small to feel.

The novice investor will likely not realize that those past returns are simply impossible to be duplicated in the future unless we go to negative interest rates. People are being given retirement income projections where the bond portion of their portfolio is projected to return 4% - 5%, virtually guaranteed and then their money is being invested in bonds that yield 2% or less.  This is their return before fees. Meanwhile, they are basing their retirement spending on that 4% - 5% rate of return to age 90. \nMaybe you disagree but I do not see that as being sound (or honest) investment advice.",

A recent, vile case involved the killing of many walrus with semi- automatic weapons, and the only thing harvested were the tusks. \n\nWhere do you think the Chinese are going to turn when they can no longer illegally import elephant and rhino ivory due to loss of these animals?\n\nAnd you do understand walrus are under significant threat due to the loss of sea ice?",

The lawsuit was filed just to extort money from these religiously based hospitals who spend much of the little money they collect from patients with insurance helping those who can't pay their hospital bills.  The underhanded, cynical lawyers who drew up the lawsuits know that these hospitals don't  have resources to hire slick, $500 an hour attorneys  to defend their interests since these hospitals spend all of their spare money to help the poor and thus they will lose in court and will not be able to pay the judgment. Then the cynical lawyers will get together with soul less venture capitalists to buy a bankrupt hospital out of bankruptcy.  Then they will set up a for-profit hosptial.  This is what these class-action lawsuits are all about.\n \nHow's that Nate.  Did I get it right, now?",

The cities with the greatest gun control also have the highest crime rates this shows at the very least that gun control is not effective and in the worst case it shows that it actually increases crime.  \nThe gun control crowd is lacking on facts and relies heavily on emotion when trying to justify why they want to curtail others rights.

As Hannah Arendt wrote in her classic essay, evil is banal, it's ordinary, and in the US it has been dominant from the first, far greater than any ideology. Your own response here is to assume that I make sweeping statements that are to be avoided, but the truth is the slavery and genocide were not a matter of individual wrongdoing. They were intrinsic to an exploitive, entitled culture that has never willingly changed on its own, and is still raging among a large portion of white Americans.",

Crosby had no part in the Preds hitting 4 posts last night, or in the puck (correctly) being blown dead before a goal was scored.  He had nothing to do with Subban's goal being called back for a razor-thin offside review in Game 1.  Seven games against Caps, and a 2 OT 7th game victory against the Sens.  At some point, any of those things could have gone against them, and there is no question they had some incredibly good fortune this year - not like last year when they simply outplayed everyone.  When so much is left to chance - as it is all the time in the NHL playoffs - it is difficult to say one player makes such a huge difference - as the commentators always seem so desperate to do with Crosby.  Take Malkin's contributions away, and there are no \"Crosby Cups.\"  And Malkin's contributions could not be replaced by someone else \"stepping up\"",

Hopefully this time we can laugh this family right out of politics once and for all, oh they can try and try and try,  and eventually,  the voters will show them  AGAIN that they are not wanted, needed, or valid. Thank God the City of Toronto voted NO on anything named for Ford. Toronto is still an international laughing stock around the world because of them.. ENOUGH is enough, we don't want anymore of this stupidity to reflect on us world wide, once was more than enough thank you.",

My parish, perhaps, the largest in  the archdiocese, Visitation, was in a state of high tension for years as I was growing up.  The fear of blacks breaking the boundaries to move into our neighborhood, which they eventually did, was ever present.  Never a word, a sermon, a lesson about the racial conflict which hung as a persistent cloud over us. A non-Catholic couple had a meeting in their home regarding union activities. Some black persons were invited to attend. Parishioners swelled to about a 1,000 a night for a period of time till the couple was forced to sell and the parish bought the property to keep the neighborhood white.  The RCC was proactive in maintaining segregation.  This is well documented. Check out: The Siege of South Peoria Street.",

Given that the US federal government has increased federal spending by trillions and trillions of dollars over the past 8 years I would I surmise the correct answer is ALL of them!! But let's start with Social Security and Medicare (but don't forget extended unemployment benefits). \n\nThe nation’s long-term spending trajectory remains on a fiscal collision course. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare are too large and growing rapidly. While the Budget Control Act of 2011 and sequestration are modestly restraining the discretionary budget, mandatory spending—including entitlements—continues to grow nearly unabated. Eighty-five percent of the projected growth in spending over the next decade is due to entitlement spending and interest on the debt. Obamacare is the largest driver of increasing federal health care spending, and it alone will add $1.8 trillion in federal spending by 2024.",

There is no way that a \"western\" mindset has almost 40% of the votes, be it the GC session delegates or in the annual council. This outcome was what surprised me most and it made me think. I now believe that all of this has more to do with a \"urban\" vs. \"rural\" mindset.

However, to compliment it,  the two left lanes from Kinau Street should have solid lines on that side to prevent lane changing.    \nTo help motorists who no longer can use the Piikoi Street onramp, the city should lengthen the traffic lights on Ward at King and Beretania.  There is now a host of cars on King making that left turn up Ward.  Of course the cycle track does not help.  The other onramp is by the Humane Society.  However, traffic on King Street is terrible especially by Kalakaua and Punahou Streets.  Those two traffic signals need to be lengthen.

It's true he doesn't ask for the audience's forgiveness in so many words, but I would agree with Romney the speech was part of an apology tour.",

And it works - 16% drop in fossil fuels in BC to 3% increase in ROC since implementation per the G&M in July 2014:\n\n\"B.C.’s tax, implemented in 2008, covers most types of fuel use and carbon emissions. It started out low ($10 per tonne of carbon dioxide), then rose gradually to the current $30 per tonne, which works out to about 7 cents per litre of gas. “Revenue-neutral” by law, the policy requires equivalent cuts to other taxes. In practice, the province has cut $760-million more in income and other taxes than needed to offset carbon tax revenue.\n\nThe result is that taxpayers are coming out ahead. B.C. now has the lowest personal income tax rate in Canada (with additional cuts benefiting low-income and rural residents) and one of the lowest corporate rates in North America. You shouldn’t need an economist and a mining entrepreneur to tell you that’s good for business and jobs.\"",

What will really transform downtown is being able to park, shop, eat, and walk without having to use your car. That's pretty difficult right now. Having a cohesive riverfront space connecting downtown with the University area is better for everyone. I believe that's the goal here, I'm willing to pay more to ensure that happens - vs the land going to the highest bidder and more cheap housing going in. The mixed-use space is perfect and we need the right developer to do it well.\n\nDisclaimer, because I get this a lot: I do not work for or with the city in any capacity.",

I always find it odd how people try to imbue countries with humanistic, moralizing, characteristics.  Yes, nations are largely a product of historic events that shape them, but countries aren't responsible for actions, positive or negative, people are.  So let's give credit where credit is due and hold the perpetrators responsible for their actions and not the anthropomorphized state through which the blame is then diffused among innocent, contemporary citizens.  I am responsible for the actions I take, and perhaps, the state or other institutional actions I promote and support, nothing more, nothing less.  Yes, the government must offer compensation to living individuals that have suffered at the hands of the state, naturally.

A new study on the Eocene epoch, which lasted from around 56 million to 34 million years ago, concludes that although the time period was known to be among the hottest in Earth's history, it may not have been quite as toasty as previously thought. Researchers for the study said that high levels of carbon dioxide were to blame for the global temperature spike, but the new study revised the average temperatures in subtropic regions -- the study focused on mollusk fossils from Alabama -- from the previously estimated 86 degrees to a new estimate of 80 degrees, still five degrees hotter than the modern day average of 75 degrees.",

It was a springboard for launching into a new era class warfare by claiming to be guardians of the shrinking 'middle class'. Clever, and MSM fell for it all goo-goo eyed. \n\nHere's some news for the silly MSM,  the real rich spend 10 grand cash on a Saturday afternoon on a new piece of furniture. They don't need TFSA's and no one, rich or poor, gets a tax break for the contribution.  It's just a simple and smart way to set aside some saving for a significant purchase or investment in your family's future.
