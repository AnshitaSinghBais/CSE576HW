At my last oncology appointment, my doctor said, \"You are a mess.\" Yes, I was in AGONY. He prescribed Prozac. Fuck him (I threw it on the floor and hobbled out).

Not because the Inuit peoples have hunted the whales for centuries to sustain themselves, but because YOUR past relatives hunted the whales to near extinction for whale oil, and nothing else.  I have been around and spent time with Native Alaskans, and whether it is Moose, Whale or any other animal, I have found them to be very respectful of the animal and the environment.  It is a part of their culture; a culture that has existed for centuries.

Free psych care for their schizophrenia, their bipolar, criminal behavior, anti personality disorders.\nObviously, When they got back home,  they told all their associates about the Canadian push overs and suckers as the 2016 numbers of claimants is climbing.\n\nThe American washed up actor Randy Quade and wife freak show was the best example. Canadians are so desperate for validation and crave US publicity so much that they allowed themselves to be conned.",

You believe yourself to be the best and you think that's all it takes, saying you're the best, but not proving it by actual work or credentials. So of course you believe no one can be smarter or more talented than you... until of course you go out into the real world and see how it truly is, and not what exists in your fantasized version of it.

Ed Rogers has a long history of involvement in anti-American operations including Iran/Contra and BCCI Middle East banking scandals.  George Bush even kicked him out of the White House staff.

Too bad their anger can't be directed towards solving problems that actual exist today - like climate change, the refugee problem, Russians hacking into our voting machines, a certified idiot leading our country!",

Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is very competent, and he will soon teach the others how to frame things so that, no matter how objectionable in spirit, they will be formally impeccable when it comes to judicial review.

We have no revolution to glorify, and we have never had conflict on our own soil except as a colony.  Illustrious tales are few, we slogged our way into nationhood, and the first seeds were sown not by us but by Britain in 1867.  WWI proved we could stand on our own.\n\nAs an aside, I am saddened by Wilson-Raybould 's remark that it is “hard to celebrate 150 years of colonialism.”  Aboriginals got a raw deal, true enough, but even though our history has its share of lamentable events, we have also done much to be proud of.

In fact, your accusation that Democrats \"offer gifts and boons\" (such as health care, food, and education for all Americans) that are \"unaffordable\" blames those defending human rights which certainly are affordable for our society, rather than Republicans who refuse to pay for it, keeping it for the wealthy.",

Here's something for a moron like you to think about:  Of the 50 least educated counties in the USA, Trump won 47 of 50.  And Trump could only manage to win 2 of the most educated counties.  The greatest correlation between a vote for trump and trump voter's attributes was lack of education.  Not income, not race, not gender, not age.  So, for stupid white guys like you who love the baby-in-chief, it's time to own your racism, homophobia, and misogyny that are all tied to your lack of education and your willful stupidity. But please keep posting so I continue to have a chance to point out your stupidity.",

IMO when you have a multi-billion dollar project where the vast majority of the costs are in external engineering and construction contracts; scrimping on internal staffing to save $2-3 million a year is literally the definition of being penny-wise, pound foolish.  If anything, the City should have overspent on HART staffing to make sure they always had more than enough staffing to stay on top of the workload to help prevent any unnecessary delays.",

How trendy. \n\nBut the bishop wants to do what all loving shepherds and compassionate pastors should do at a time like this--he wants to draw the line!

Some people have jobs or businesses (professions) that they love, and want to continue, or else want to start new careers.  That's great. Then there are others who want to retire in their late 50s or early 60s, if their financial situations allow them to do so, in order to play golf or otherwise pursue lives of leisure for the rest of their days. That's ok, too, because only a minority of people are in the latter category anyway. If too many people were to retire and pursue lives of leisure, society would certainly be in trouble. On the other hand, if most people  wanted to continue working into old age, that would present a big problem, because many younger workers would have to wait on the sidelines for good-paying jobs to come their way and thus create a lot of resentment on their part.

Being Anti-WO is not the same as being Anti-women, but they are those who present it in that light in order to make a case, in which the Word of God sets no precedent. So they stubbornly seek their own way and strongly believe they are doing God's service. That is why at least in one conference, it has led to the selection of a transgender person to lead a church. Indeed, rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.

True health care in Europe overall is more public than Canada due to the fact it is much more comprehensive in its coverage such as largely covering prescription drugs.",

They played an important part in Alaskan history not just American history.

Most builders sell the property off either to individuals or to another owner who rents it out thus  the theory, mostly of the left, is that builders don't care about \"life-cycle cost\" they only care about up front cost which would mean things like green roofs and solar panels don't get built.  I think that shows a nieve lack of understanding as any competent buyer would study the O&M (Operations and Maintenance) costs and take those life-cycle costs into account which would of course influence their offer price to purchase the property so that builders, in fact, do have an incentive to do things like green roofs.",

Too little chance of catching a King (it's called 'fishing' not catching' for a reason), only allowed 1 per year if I recall correctly, expensive for the tag, no boat, long distance + expensive gas = empty wallet, bumper to bumper traffic there and back, land yachts moving at 7 MPH the entire way blotting out the sun, road construction delays, combat fishing so bad people were shooting guns at each other.... could add more but I think the point is made. Seriously not even worth considering anymore. I do my part to help the Kings get to the spawning grounds by not even fishing for them. I want fish, I go bobber fishing for trout in local lakes or make a fishing trip to Carrs. Canned pinks work really well for tuna fish salad.",

This does not seem at all right to me.   There should be some sort of clear threat, before deadly force is used.  And tasering a man at the wheel of a car?   How on earth could one expect the person to be able to maintain control of the vehicle at that point??   Doing that was incredibly poor judgement.\n\nDrunk people are often confused, and very slow in responding.    You cannot bark orders at someone, and always expect fast compliance.\n\nYet, disobey an officer's orders these days, and you might be met with a hail of  bullets.\n\nI'm all for protecting officers, but we need to have a much more balanced approach than this.\n\n.",

It's the woman's problem!  No one should have the right to tell another what to believe!",

And yes, who instinctively reacted on many issues with assumptions that White, British subjects had the best civilization in the world.\n\nIt's kind of more interesting that way.\n\nI think Hector-Louis Langevin is getting a bit of a raw deal for having been a Cabinet minister who supported the direction of the government of the day in Parliament (and therefore is on the record as supporting residential schools).  And I think criticism of Edgerton Ryerson (where contemporary Aboriginal leaders did not) is presentism in the extreme.  But I like that we're discussing it.",

He was thinking more in terms of Jewish practices of a covenant, and Passover remembrance.\n Whether he was 'present' in two different forms that Thursday night – in his actual human form, and distributing his 'sacramental' presence, likely never occurred to him. Did He 'transubstantiate' himself? Certainly he had not died as yet, so that his death could be 'remembered'. He was giving them a model of something to do in the future.\n\nAnd when they finished the meal, they just got up and left. No 'tabernacles' or anything.

Currently, 171-36(b) specifically allows for extensions or modifications of the lease period, as long as it does “not exceed sixty-five years.” HB1469 CD1 proposes to eliminate that cap, as long as the board approves a development agreement. This empowers the board to give out leases FOREVER, for almost ANY lands, not just for resorts, that supposedly need more than 65 years. This would specifically allow the Board to extend the Mauna Kea lease for another 50, 60, 100 years, binding the hands of Native Hawaiians and the public for multiple generations.

I think the deferral results from the difference in the corporate tax paid annually by the corporation and what is paid when the capital is removed from the corporation.  Once the capital is removed from the corporation, it is taxed at the nominal rate. The benefit is that money left in the corporation can be invested and earn additional returns (thus paying additional taxes - capital gains).  Taxes are paid in full, there is just a delay between when the revenue is earned by the corporation  and when the individual pays the income tax on them, similar to an individual RRSP.",

From what I undertand, scizophrenia is the predictor, although in most case there is nothing demonic about it. Certainly the case that spawned the movie had nothing to do with anything but a vulerable child. I can see parents asking for exorcism for a gay child, but there is likely no demon involved and the exorcist is likely to be gay.",

For the rest of the NT the soul, when mentioned at all, is simply the life principle and dies with the death of the body, which is why Paul in 1 Cor 15 has to speak of the risen body as a penumatic body, given as a new creation. As I remember my scholastic philosophy, experience, insight etc. were faculties of the soul, which was adopted because philosophically it assured each person was already immortal and thus had to take care of living with faith and grace. Aquinas' theology of grace was all dependent on that grace moving and permeating the soul. Still, in the gospel and Paul soul (psyche) just means living life.",

The regime however has no interest in mind but its own survival and continued aggrandisement so in this sense the carrot must be allowing them to continue with their hermit ways, oppressing the the NK people but not threatening the world beyond their borders.

What nondaulity empahsizes is the notion of \"not two.... but not one.\"  It is a paradox which could generate understandings of a triune God, christology, but more importantly, ourselves, even physics in our universe.  It offers a creative tension between diversity (difference) and unity.

While partisan media definitely has pushed people apart, the \"traditional\" media has had a much lesser role in that. I also don't think the evidence supports the assertion that Trump's words have been taken out of context (by traditional media, not partisan media), or that the messengers (not the actual actors themselves) have stoked fears and racism. Significant issues were not addressed in this past campaign, such as environmental destruction, because the public didn't demand it. Media generally gives its audiences what they demand.",

It was mostly for rural parents & kids without local choices, because they lived in villages too small for high schools; or perhaps even for public elementary schools; or in homestead-type rural isolation.  In some cases it was for rural parents who didn't want their children to attend the local school that had been established & was run by religious or cult groups. And yes,I've seen excellent academic & socialization results from home schooling - and some very troubling academic and socialization results emanating from public education.

The time has come to strike down these unnecessary restrictions in Missouri.\"\n\nAs I understand it, SCOTUS' ruling is based on expert testimony from numerous OBGYN professionals.\nWere it not, and there were cases of women being hurt at non-inspected clinics, then I'd agree with those who are arguing for more government regulation.   \n\nBut I'm not seeing any such reports of women being hurt.

If prices drop due to excess supply, they are incented to reduce production.  However under stumpage, the Canadian producers have no incentive to reduce production, and their profit levels are assured, because if the lumber prices drop, the stumpage cost drops so they remain whole.  It is an insurance scheme for industry profits - they have transferred the risk to tax payers.  The gov collects less revenue from selling its wood, but what do they care so long as lumber companies and unions are happy?

When the French came to NS (Louisberg) they provided the local natives with guns. Since South Western NL (St Georges Bay) is the banana belt of NL with pre 1950's fantastic food resources, including Salmon rivers and caribou. One has to wonder who actually killed off the original Beothuck natives. The originals hunter/gatherer NL's and the NS invaders would have had to have fought over the same resources. Only one had guns. As I have I/16 invader DNA by way of a French Soldier and an abandoned native wife I could have applied. NL has some very old families and they had a lot of years to mingle. Many families have inside stories about having native blood.",

Country Z's having an election, and the front-runner is a candidate that wants to nationalize foreign businesses. MNC goes to the government of Country X and complains. Country X then uses spy-craft to get inside info on the nationalist political party. They bug its offices, pay informants and, of course, hack its computers. If they find information that can be politically exploited, they leak it to an opposing party or the press. They use an intermediary of course, so that Country X isn't seen directly interfering in the election. MNC and opposing parties didn't break any law, so they're clean. \n\nThere's many reasons why a foreign government would prefer one candidate over another. Hacking computers is just another way of getting what they've always sought- exploitable information.",

Not to mention the requirement of grad training to score funding.

Secrecy is of the essence of penance. The sinner will not confess, nor will the priest receive his confession, if the veil of secrecy is removed: To decide that the minister shall promulgate what he receives in confession, is to declare that there shall be no penance...\n\nFirst_and_Fifth_Amendment,_like_spoual_and_attorney_client._Secrecy_is_not_a_legal_term,_it_is_Canon_Law._Don't_confuse_the_two._Unless_a_confession_is_public,_the_penitent_is_protected_from_testimony_from_a_confessor.",

The extra administration that this measure cause is likely to offset the meager gains from imposing this measure.  This is not what the fight is about. Think $28 B in \"passive\" investment income. Corporations that have only passive investment income are deemed to be fairly treated by the tax system and will see no change. Reinvested passive income is also fairly treated using the same logic. The passive income proposals are effectively aimed at clawing back a portion of the small business tax deduction in situations where the business owner has retained earnings that are deemed excessive.

And it's true that the form of it in countries like Norway is vastly better--- but those countries that do a better job don't have our history of inclusion: we aren't a white only country--- as most of them were until very recently. \nIt's good to have ideals, but \"the perfect is the enemy of the good.\" \nYou sound very much like our President who would like to keep everything right here in the US.",

Let us do some medical logic that we have on hand and add the studies on gun violence for decades on top of that. The results with those who commit suicide with a gun, shows that if a gun is handy the event happens more often, but if a potential suicide victim has to go and use another \"method\" they have more time to think about what they are doing and that time is valuable in making the decision not to end their lives. Same as for murders, the gun is handy to settle disputes more often than having to search out other means when one is angry. There are more murders by guns than by knives or baseball bats.   Research shows that people kill with guns because there is little time between the thought and the event. Having even a small buffer zone can prevent someone from killing someone else or killing themselves.\nI have talked to many people who did not commit suicide and the reason they did not.",

If it interferes with your neighbour's reasonable enjoyment of his property, then yes he could sue you over it.\n\nMore practically, I think this is going to have to be handled by municipalities the way that other common nuisances are handled - through bylaws. As it stands many municipalities have already outlawed through bylaw open air burning. In Toronto, for instance, you can't have a fire pit in  your backyard, although cooking appliances are exempted.\n\nAs I see it, similar rules could come into force if marijuana use becomes a serious nuisance.",

You would think that begin pummeled with with a baseball bat and curb stomped or shot by your ex lover would be at least if not more traumatic than some examples of alleged rape. For example, where someone indicates that they wanted to have sex with someone that they know earlier in the night, but then when they are drunk, but conscious, and don't indicate that that they no longer want to have sex, only to regret it in the morning. Also, somehow it seems that if both participants are drunk it is the man who is more likely to be held responsible.  This is the only situation that I know of where if you make a bad decision while you are drunk you are not held responsible for it.

To detain persons at ICE request for 48hrs and 2.)Give ICE access to city facilities to interrogate any suspected non-citizen held there. These requirements seem very reasonable and I can think of no reason to object to these requirements other than to protect non-citizens that are in the country illegally. Yet they still want the $400,000 plus grant money. That is an oxymoron. I would rather have the Justice Department award more funding to other cities in Colorado that do comply with the new requirements in an effort to rid our country of illegal immigrants.

There are numerous examples available in the past and in recent decades from around the world where despots controlling an unarmed or weakly armed citizenry wreaked havoc on that citizenry. There are also examples of governments that were overthrown because their citizenry threatened significant violence to bring about change and had the means to do so. Do you get it CE?",

For another, prohibitions against ending a lease for any but the extremest of reasons makes them quake in their boots.  \n\nIf rent controls on ALL properties, both post- AND pre-1991, were abolished, the shortage of supply would vanish.",

But as Mac Donald writes in The Wall Street Journal, 2009 statistics from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reveal that blacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\"\n\nhttp://www.dailywire.com/news/7264/5-statistics-you-need-know-about-cops-killing-aaron-bandler",

That, due to government policy, enjoys capital gains exemptions nonetheless?

Should those who live and work in the GTA have their lives turned upside down by mega-debt and displacement so international money can run free?  What happens to a local  economy when the locals can't afford the housing?  The steep climb in RE prices isn't due to the genius of local homeowners who bought 7-30 years ago.
