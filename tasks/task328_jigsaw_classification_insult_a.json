Former Kenyan citizen Barack Obama arrogantly refused to produce his long-form birth certificate, which he should have done when he was running for president in 2008. Trump should be commended for publicizing the issue; he was the one who shamed Obama into finally producing it in April 2011, about three years after Obama should have done so. It is a fair criticism that Trump kept at this issue even after the release of the long form birth certificate when he should have dropped it. However, if Obama hadn’t joked in a banquet speech, in Trump’s presence, about how now that he had produced the long form certificate Trump could get on with questioning the moon landing, Trump probably never would have run for office. Why does Ibbitson fail to see that Obama behaved like an insufferable twit? We hit peak Ibbitson long ago, and the descent has been steep.",

Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks.

At least be a man and use your real name. Keyboard coward.",

So, get ready for once the greatest inversion of logic ever, you need more payers so the providers can bill ever more payers thus competing with each other to see who can increase billing the most! Competition would be increasing the number of providers, possibly through immigration or reduced stringency of licensure which restricts the availability of providers. And thus the increased supply would drive the price down at least for the same demand (ceteris paribus which in reality never happens anyway). The trouble with incoherent ideology is that it shoots itself in its own self-professed foot just to avoid the cognitive dissonance from its own fallacy. This example, however, is one the most extremely incoherent, Trumping most, so to speak.",

For example, the business license, the property taxes, and other \"government\"-related expenses for running a business.

(The business model of potentially unlimited sales and thus profit doesn't apply, and every hour spent at daycare competes for an hour of the parents' wages.)  People have to be careful about looking at the entire cost of daycare as a singular expense.  Part of that cost is just covering supplies for the daycare, which a parent would be buying anyway if they were at home.  What the daycare spends on food, for example, is what the parent would have spent to feed the kid themselves if they were home, and bulk pricing might actually make some of those things relatively cheaper in a daycare setting.  So really it's only the daycare staff salaries we should consider an economically tricky expense.",

The issue, of course, is \"just what is morality.\"  Certainly the Civil Rights Act represented a statement of morality.  ..a statement of what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong\" in terms of treating other people.  \n\nThe issue of abortion is far less clear. Some see it as an immoral act which should be outlawed.  On the \"flip side\", a majority of  Americans see it as a woman's decision..her Choice and a reflection of her own personal morality.  So the key issue really surrounds just how much freedom of personal morality does a society allow?  Just when is the society justified in saying \"sorry, no, that action (whatever it might be) is beyond the scope of personal moral choice is is now a \"legal\" issue?

If the present inquest system doesn’t allow for truth and justice then perhaps Dow can establish a separate, independent, citizen comprised parallel fact finding commission that is not hampered by the current highly bureaucratic and biased process. Take what comes out of the current legal inquest show and use that as a basis for further inquiry and analysis.

This kind of decision by young Canadians leads to another question - are universities REALLY delivering in terms of the investment we put into them.  Many of our kids are saying no, but the universities are grabbing the foreign money to keep business as usual going.  I'm not opposed to foreign students coming to learn here in Canada, but I'm worried that again, our government is asleep at the switch, not asking the questions it should, and looking at the return of value to the investment made.",

Several years ago I was working next to a veteran that had served in Viet Nam, and a vehicle backfired. He was face down on a concrete surface so quick that it scared myself and several other co-workers, we had no idea what happened. He got up after 30 seconds or so, embarrassed, humiliated and very apologetic, totally out of character for him. He cowered when people would get too close to him for some time after that. It wasn't an act, and I became a believer. Also consider people's pets, it terrifies our indoor pets, they hide for days. It's unnecessary, inconsiderate, immature and probably illegal.",

Watch what happens when markets go down. We have seen a couple of small examples where large ETF's have had horrible trading days. The market makers were not there. We'll see what happens when it gets real ugly. Also it has  not been difficult to outperform the TSX for the last 5 or 10 year time period. Many Canadian based mutual funds have outperformed their respective TSX index. However that wasn't the case during commodity bull run of 2001 -2008. Bond funds are another example of outperformance.

Indeed, the Republican House voted to repeal the Law of Gravity 63 times in the last year of Barack Obama’s presidency. The GOP plan is to privatize gravity and give tax credits to those who wish to fall, so they can afford the cost. Those plans are still up in the air. \nRepealing the Law of Gravity has been a goal of Republicans since the First Great Awakening in 1739. That era of spiritual revival was the genesis of the now-fashionable “belief” laws, where you don’t have to obey a law unless you believe its morally correct.

The base stuck with him while the identity-focused voters fled to the higher bidder for their affections, Trudeau's Libs. Now the Conservatives, sans Harper, appear to be tailoring their approach to appeal to a more mainstream Canadian audience, an audience Trudeau so detests that he denies its existence. So the Conservatives obviously learned something in 2015 while Trudeau thinks the identity game will keep him in power. If I were him I wouldn't count on it.",

The city used eminent domain confident that the agreed to price would be the same price a judge award.

Im writing to you with the hopes that maybe you might be able to assist me in directing me in the right direction for help. Myself, my boyfriend, our 13 yr old son and his two kitties have been homeless going on a year now. My boyfriend lost his job of 10 years and they are fighting him for unemployment. That leaves the three of us living on my disability which doesn't go far. \n\nWe desperately just want a place to call our own again and to have some stability and happiness. We have went through all places suggested and the only thing we seem to get is sent around in circles. If there is anything you know of we could try, I would be eternally grateful. We managed to get a night at the Executive Hotel on W. 6th but will have to be out by 11am then we are back to outside. Please, any help at all.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/278733372196382/",

Now that they've received fully half the Catholic vote last November they've turned their attention to dismantling all of President Obama's initiatives that were designed to help save the planet. American Catholics had the chance to vote for someone who would continue Obama's policies, but half of them chose someone who is doing his level best to destroy the planet so that rich oil executives can get even richer. Way to go, Trump Catholics - you've made the world such a welcome place for those precious fetuses about which you claim to care so much.

The 'printed' kind has a tendency to be more fact-filled, and in less need of having their viewers believe they are the sole-source for a story.  The visual people simplify, and are not capable of telling a story with too any moving parts (due to time constraints and advertising pressures?).  They do sound-bite journalism.  The consolidation of the media, visually speaking, has radically reduced news content and in turn made it easier, and almost 'justified' in 'borrowing' stories, and making no effort to acknowledge how they found them.  In this stew, its almost obligatory to omit a lot of data.  I lament the continued decline of critical, well thought-out journalism, and feel strongly that this lack of attribution only serves to enforce shoddy and inaccurate news reporting.",

If suspects were unarmed or did not return fire results were better, but they still missed far more than half the time.  Bear in mind these NYPD officers were all trying to immediately stop or immobilize a suspect; in other words, they were likely trying to put bullets into vital organs or the central nervous system - which means the torso or the head.  Yet, most of their bullets went astray to endanger innocent bystanders.\n\nA little vignette:  two SIG Sauer P226 armed cops, each with 16 9mm rounds on tap, both fired upon the same suspect.

After the inauguration, the person said, Mr. Flynn and his lawyer each raised it again with a White House lawyer, only to be told once more it was up to him. Mr. Flynn had no comment on Friday. His lawyer wrote the Justice Department that Mr. Flynn decided to register retroactively “to eliminate any potential doubt.”",

Do you think people in Berlin can be rationally afraid of Muslims after an event like the Christmas Market attack? and if so when can we be rationally afraid that something will happen to us by some other extremist? \n\nWhile I do recognize that many people are over reacting, and in the case of Quebec or Trump, making the our country/world more dangerous and giving more power to the likes of ISIS.

They have created a culture of fear combined with the ability to enforce their will through the power of government and institutional intimidation as opposed to actually changing hearts. The only way to disrupt that dysfunction is by pointing out what they are doing, and that if the grievance industry and leftists really were serious about improving race relations they would use forgiveness instead, as MLK admonished them to. Yet it is hard for them to make that shift for fear of being attacked as racist themselves. When a person is threatened with loss of livelihood and reputation, it is a powerful negative incentive which has the effect of reinforcing the mob mentality. Whether you are liberal or conservative, this whole mentality must be rejected.\n\nhttp://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/love-and-forgiveness",

Silvert made a big stink in court about the mistrial -- he thought he was winning -- and he laid out for the Judge the issues with the reports, and the evidence that he said the PD falsified.

However, Rolovich did not have that luxury of knowing Brown's pass would tipped at the line of scrimmage and then intercepted when they got into the red zone in OT. As the clock was winding down late in the fourth quarter in regulation, I must admit that I agreed with the coaches decision to let the clock expire and try to beat them in overtime as they had only 38 seconds to move the ball 50 yards to get into field goal range, which translates to running two plays, most likely a pair of rushed long passes which could have resulted in a turnover, even a pick-six. The risk, was too great, for even if the Warriors did miraculously march the ball downfield 50 yards in less than 40 seconds, their field goal unit is far from automatic--kicker Ryan Meskell is 0-for-2 from beyond 30 yards this season. Thus I refuse to second guess Rolovich's decision to run out the clock. Go Warriors!",

The thing is, to take some one from \"not qualified\" to \"fully qualified\" would be 5 or 6 years. Foreign trained individuals can, in many cases, jump right in - i.e., they do not need the 5 or 6 years of training because they have had it elsewhere. The Canadian worker, however, has never had that \"training\" and so simply cannot compete. If the available jobs could be filled by \"existing Canadians\" they would be.

We will never overcome primal racism because it is part of our basic nature.  So in this increasingly crowded planet, if we are going to live together and not die together, we need to learn to live with people who may have different cultural attributes, and who may say or believe things that we do not like.  The best way to accomplish that would be to preserve sufficient space for people of different groups, and not force them to live on top of each other.  Diversity is not strength, it is a potential source of social tension.  People seem to know that instinctively and tend to live in their own communities.  We have seen that pattern in Canada's experiment in multiculturalism, that we have created many disparate ethnic/social groupings of people in mini-monocultures.

You won't find those values at Roosevelt, just adherence to the rigid progressive, neo-liberal philosophy with which the teaching staff openly proselytize.",

Thus, it is alleged, the only way out of perpetual poverty is foreign aid.  And with foreign aid, what we created is a dependency continent.

About 65% of all sexual assault victims are children or youths under the age of 17.\n\n2. The vast majority of sexual assaults- 80%- occur in the victim's home.\n\n3. The vast majority- 80%-  of the perpetrators are known to the victims.\n\n4. Only a small percentage of sexual assault cases are reported to the police.\n\nThe perpetrator of a sexual assault is most likely to be a family member of the victim, and the overall prevalence of such assaults could exceed 20% of all households.

The increase of inflation when it comes is insignificant and just allows them to keep pace, it doesn't create jobs or productivity. I don't know whether you are working or not, but any increase in wages tied to inflation never amounted to a significant amount of money to change your lifestyle since everything else had gone up.

It was an academic question about the limits of academic freedom: Peled was debating about freedom of speech and what restrictions we might place upon it. It may not have been a well timed or helpful comment at this point, but to characterise it as 'Holocaust denial' is wholly false.

He has never questioned the Holocaust. This article is a disgrace.",

These are the \"big claims,\" the unexpected and catastrophic, which would be the only claims \"insured\" with a major medical policy that has a $10,000 deductible.  You can pay the low premiums for it out of your HSA.\n\nThe other 50% of the claims incurred by 95% of the people amount to much less than $3,000 per year, so the HSA account balances for most people putting $250/mo into their HSA will grow.\n\nWe would still have to subsidize the HSAs for the poor, but it would be nice if we were only having to subsidize 40% to 50% lower costs, which HSAs would provide.

I agree that if one wants to do a full-scale analysis of the economies of various states and correlate that to tax laws, there are many more facts to consider. You bring up the collapse in oil prices in N.D. as a reason for the job loss. I agree. I would also venture that the economy of N.D. has almost nothing to do with how much the N.D. state legislature made its tax laws attractive to businesses. The tax laws of N.D. did not attract shale oil :-) after all which is all there is there.\n\nAnyway, I've made no claims here in support of this tax law. In general, I think income inequality has arisen due to the wealthy controlling the lawmakers and laws to make things in their favor, and some mechanism is needed to correct this, but I think there are better ways.",

States can vary greatly in this regard. For instance, most states exempt groceries from the sales tax, others tax groceries at a limited rate, and still others tax groceries at the same rate as all other products.[11] Some states exempt clothing or tax it at a reduced rate.  Tax experts generally recommend that sales taxes apply to all final retail sales of goods and services but not intermediate business-to-business transactions in the production chain. These recommendations would result in a tax system that is not only broad-based but also “right-sized,” applying once and only once to each product the market produces. \"  Having problems copy/pasting yet what follows seems to confirm your statement.",

It is an offence against the inviolability of life and the dignity of the human person, which contradicts God's plan for man and society, and His merciful justice, and impedes the penalty from fulfilling any just objective.

One of the definitions of 'rape' in the Oxford dictionary is 'the wanton destruction or spoiling of a place' as in ‘the rape of the countryside’.

This pope rails a lot.  But I notice that in general (a) 'clericalism' has become a bad thing, and (b) 'clericalism' seems to mean 'anything I don't like'.  To a 'progressive', cassocks and birettas are clericalism; to a traditionalist, it was clericalism when the priest pulled down the altar rail,or ad-libs his way through the Novus Ordo, or refuses to allow a Tridentine mass in his parish.\n2. Of course, time was when ‘anti-clericalism’ was the bad thing—recall the French and Spanish Revolutions.\n3. (cont’d….)",

The legislative branch (Congress) is responsible for making and changing laws; the executive (the President) is responsible for faithfully executing the laws and the judiciary (the courts) for interpreting laws.  If Congress does not pass a law requested by the President, so be it.  He cannot then “just do it” with an Executive Order as you seem to think.

How much did this cost the fishing fleet?  $3,000,000 dollars in Upper Cook Inlet alone!  Sockeye were a pound less across the state so lets see 40,000,000 sockeye each with a pound less weight?  $40,000,000 dollars? It is well known on big pink years our sockeye are smaller or less of them.  Plus on top of us losing to the hatchery fishermans welfare fish we have to pay 2% on our skinny sockeye to raise these pinks in hatcheries known to cause trouble with wild salmon! Cook Inlet Aquaculture not only cost recovers all the fish in Tutka with their preferred ranching fisherman, damages the sockeye and  takes 100% for cost recovery of the fish in resurrection bay.

Coding is a language and the reason we teach it is to give students the flexibility of getting inside the language, the framework of thought. It is NOT about programming as an end goal. BTW, all the educational  performance data supports coding. Nevertheless, life in any science (social and technical) is about creating/observing predictable patterns and testing them out. You will notice that young children do this instinctively anyway. They are constantly assessing, testing, repeating, modifying, retesting.

And it was Clinton who wanted to stop illegal immigration, hire more border patrol and deport more illegal aliens.  Finally the Democrats are the biggest hypocrites around.  No one has a right to enter the United States except those born here.  But the Dems with their \"abortion on demand\" are suppressing those rights.",

Now you call this an \"irrational fear\" of Islam?  You do understand the concepts of advertising don't you.  You know get the message out \"Drink Coke\" \"Have a Coke and smile\".  hey before you know it that thought is ingrained in our heads. When you are at the store  you say \"hey I think I'll have a coke and a smile\".  This is human nature.  This is part of how advertisers get to us and it is a science.\n\nSo tell me everyday that there is a terrorist attack in the name of Islam and then tell me I'm having \"irrational fears\" about it.

It started in the 1990’s and by proving it’s effectiveness was accepted by the public and shelters. This didn’t happen until the last 10 years or so, partly due to either “bird people”, outside cat haters and supporters of Shelter killing working to spread myths about it and try to influence others to not support it. However the public overwhelmingly supports TNR vs. killing cats and animal shelters are now supporting TNR because it works, it’s humane, it’s less stressful for their employees, it saves money, and the public supports shelters with low euthanasia rates. Killing is not the answer for cats just like it is never is the answer for anything.",
