    "Definition": "In this task, you will receive a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to divide the comment into two classes: insult and non-insult. Insulting is any language or action that is disrespectful or contemptuous.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Comment: No wonder Hillary got beat by a circus clown.",
            "output": "Insult",

Still, forensics should sort some issues out, and then local law enforcement out there can get back to the hard work of trying to kill protestors with water cannons, freezing weather, and hypothermia.  Folks worried about pending fascism from the Trump regime should probably give this situation under Obama a little thought to see how sick and sold out to the oligarchic donor class our nation already is.",

While it is easy, and correct, to designate Trump as the Liar-in-Chief, I think he is better understood as the Bullsh*****-in-Chief.\" Several years ago, Harry G. Frankfurt published a book-length essay, \"On Bullsh*t\", in which he distinguishes between a liar and a bullsh*****, A liar knows the truth and is deliberately trying to communicate a falsehood. A bullsh***** neither knows nor cares what the truth is; he says only what he thinks serves his purpose in the moment. Trump knows, believes and cares about very little, other than about Donald J. Trump; he just conjures up bull in the moment. Consider the nonsense he is sending his team of liars out to try to diffuse the despicable lie about Obama wiretapping him. Imagine: Trump called Obama a \"bad (or sick) guy\"! Trump is a filthy, reckless, dangerous man. Not normal!",

However, I made a go of it for 10 years. I actually made less than I did in my old job, but because my wife and I worked together, we took dividends from the business, which minimized our taxes, and avoided all the usual payroll deductions. That was the only way we survived.\n\nWhile doing that, I met hundreds of other people in similar situations. They were leading a way of life that no one in a government or unionized job will understand. So when Trudeau/Morneau talk about \"equalizing\" them with salaried people by taxing them more, they are really assaulting a whole way of life, which millions of Canadians lead.

A low income tax in conjunction with the end of the Dividend (for the foreseeable future) is the grand bargain in sight. It will be impossible to get one without the other. Maintaining a Dividend would be an unconstitutional use of income derived from a broad based tax from both a political and constitutional perspective. A lawsuit would be filed before the ink is dry if the Legislature tries it. Maintaining a Dividend without an income tax (as the R's seem to be proposing) is fiscally irresponsible. Seaton's Dividend/Tax Credit proposal is even more unconstitutional. The only responsible solution is to end the Dividend and keep that $0.7-1.4 billion/year in the PF earning income into the future.",

Rangers, LURPs, Loch pilots, medics, grunts and officers; they smoked on patrol or when flying helicopters and they lived to tell their tales. Many believed it enhanced their perception in the jungle which is a positive thing. It was not always recreational. The Army must have known how widespread this was.

The part of the Tununuk case that was relevant to this story is the fact that the family did not have standing to be considered. Whether they would have been successful in that pursuit if they had had standing is altogether another matter. My point in responding is to acknowledge that yes, Tununuk was far more than that sole point alone. However, as regards easing the way for more, safe Native homes to come into the process and voice their desire to help and to have that desire recognized and addressed -- that, in my opinion, is significant and important.",

Ethridge is a real scientist. Singer is a pompous, self-aggrandizing \"philosopher\".

The results speak for themselves but Saunders is simply twisting the results to support a narrative aligned with his personal bias. Wilders was never going to win and even if he did win the most seats, every party has refused to cooperate with him, meaning he had no chance of forming government. Turkey's recent experience with an Islamist government highlights the regressive nature of political Islam - it is fundamentally incompatible with modern secular liberalism. Until European leaders reconcile the cultural regression within their societies, the political discussion will only polarize further. Europe needs to have an honest debate about immigration, integration, and cultural segregation because the issues facing Europe aren't a secret and pretending they don't exist will only make the situation worse.",

Add to that another 46.4 unconfined, UNSTERILIZED \"owned\" cats and you have 130.9 MILLION of these invasive, disease-ridden vermin spreading disease and destroying wildlife--a cat-hoarders dream!  No one else's.  And that population increases by 43.2 million new kittens annually.  With me so far?  There are only 128 million households in the US, and only one-third of them--42.7 million--own even ONE cat.  Please believe me this is not because there's a cat SHORTAGE.\n\nSo, should you by herculean effort manage to find homes for ONE year-class of feral kittens in just ONE kitten season--that's about 234,782 kittens A DAY for about six months, you'd have 43.2 million MORE kittens to find homes for the very NEXT kitten season.

The people never got to accrue a 1st and last month's rent before the benefits stopped. That put them right back in the same situation with no job because they still didn't have an address.

In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at -all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.\n-Fifth Law: A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.\n-Corollary to the 5th Law: A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.\n\nPaul",

I took pans from the cabinet and there were mouse droppings in them. The knife and fork drawer had mice running all over in it. Mice ran across our feet and our faces at night. The floor was crunchy when we walked. I put poison all over and they carried it and hid it in our bed. Then squirrels moved in. They ate our clothes, our furniture and chewed into the cannisters of food. Big poop everywhere! I took sheets out of the washer and a dead squirrel fell out. Then some stray cats moved in under the store across the street. Within a week all the mice and squirrels had moved on. The entire town treasured those cats. We didn't live in shacks, that is a $300,000 7 bedroom house. It can happen to you. I will never harm an outdoor cat.",

Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is very competent, and he will soon teach the others how to frame things so that, no matter how objectionable in spirit, they will be formally impeccable when it comes to judicial review.

The 2004 study he cites attributing 85% of Whidbey Island’s economy to the military was probably wrong in 2004, but it’s certainly wrong today.  The Navy is responsible for 20% of the jobs on the Island, not 85%.\n* I also give these studies their due in my report.  What’s odd about these studies, however, is that they focused 100% on benefits of the NASWI and did no analysis whatsoever of the costs.  A cost-benefit analysis without the “cost” side of the picture misinforms public policy—and that was what my study sought to remedy.\n-MORE-",

We have a Supreme court that would not allow a recount in Florida, one that by all recounts afterward showed that Gore won Florida, So our unelected Supreme Court decided that electioneer Bush. We have lost the concept of one person one vote in this country.  We now have corporations lobbying for tax payer financed private militia's to defend themselves in other nations.

Believe me when I say - there is no money in cable TV anymore. Prices are not actually set by the cable company - they are set by the parent networks like Viacom -  who then sell their channel bundles to the cable companies. You are right in that the cable industry will collapse eventually.  You are also right about the shift in content consumption.

The trade-offs for not having a pension plan is the lower corporate tax rates, so you can try and save a similar level that a public employee gets from the government.\n\nTo create a pension that pays $40K per year, you need roughly $1Million making 4%. Most public employees can not save that much themselves, yet there are plenty that get more than that in pension money. When you receive the pension, it is counted as income, and marginal tax rates apply, so you might be in the 30% tax bracket.\n\nThis is the issue business owners have. If they save that money in their corp as a pension plan, they've paid corp tax first, then a dividend tax later which will equal ~ 34%. Under the new rules, it can total over 60%.

This subtle shift was necessary because the warming as evidenced by satellite measurements has stopped since 1998, even while CO2 concentrations have continued to increase.  It has become increasingly obvious CO2 is not driving the warming, the climate, or anything else.\n\nFor the last 600,000,000 years temperatures have hovered around 12C about 14% of the time, around 22C about 50% of the time, and somewhere in between 36% of the time.  Right now we are at 14.5C, about 25% above the bottom of the historical range.  (Ref: Dr. Christopher R. Scotese‘s PALEOMAP Project at http://www.scotese.com/climate.htm).

From start to finish the discernment process is a journey at the parish and diocesan level with the candidate and both lay and ordained people who consult the bishop.  When the candidate is admitted to postulancy they begin formal theological which ends in their ordination.  The Bishop cannot ordain on his/her own whim, it must be with the consent of the ordained and lay members of the Diocese.  The same as to Episcopal Elections. Both lay and ordained must elect the Bishop and then the each Bishop and Diocesan Standing Committee must consent before the person in ordained a bishop. The Presiding Bishop is elected from the House of Bishops.  As with all systems sometimes it works well and other times, not so...but it is a system that trust the Spirit to speak through everyone involved.",

By letting these supposed non-violent offenders out of custondy, there is a high likelihood that we will have even more people committing low level crimes.

Sufferers of TURDS are identified by a persistent cognitive dissonance, sudden bouts of rage, rioting, and uncontrollable crying. TURDS is caused by the election of Trummpy. People with TURDS are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to accept that Donald Trump is president. Research is ongoing, but TURDS appears to correlate closely with some of the following environmental and behavior factors: membership in the Democratic Party, currently enrolled in a college and/or possession of a Liberal Arts Degree, and living in densely populated metropolitan areas.

The lifestyle is not for everyone and you will not get rich doing it, but if money is the concern these people can stay home and work for the same wages or better.  The trick is not to overextend your budget,  planning helps.  As far as the retirement, a government pension will have raises but a private pension is usually a set amount as the years pass that set amount has less buying power.  You have to save (and the interest rate has to increase so your money earns without risk as in the stock market), you have to been reasonable with your lifestyle. An interesting thing about workamping is the number of younger people doing it now, people in their 30's and 40's and families.  People do it to travel and maybe to find a place to relocate to.",

And as you may know, there is quite a good correlation between a nation's per-capita income level and the overall crude death rate.  (You can Google it.)  Drop the overall standard of living by 10 % or so in the USA, and that would add tens of thousands of 'extra' deaths per year to the CDR - far more than anyone suggests will occur solely to the climate-change bogeyman.

Education has a long history of pendulum swings and this is just one of them. Bottom line, PARCC is a flawed test and I suspect that in time Common Core will follow on the heals of the Whole Language Approach back in the late 80's and early 90's that turned out to be a fiasco.",

He went on that “no one ought to be deprived… of life .... no matter how serious the crime that has been committed, the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and the dignity of the person,” and that traditional arguments in defense of capital punishment “now appear clearly contrary to the new understanding of Christian truth.” He wants “a more adequate and coherent treatment” of the death penalty with a more negative attitude toward it than the Catechism issued by John Paul II.  The Catechism already includes a prudential judgment to the effect that under contemporary circumstances capital punishment should be “very rare, if not practically nonexistent.”\n\nHow is this not a new teaching in contradiction to John Paul's?",

The projected revenues to government from the proposed carbon tax are well below that figure - i.e. we are reducing, not eliminating, the subsidy. It's estimated that if the worldwide subsidy on petroleum was cut, global pollution would be reduced by 13%. And if all, or even most nations agreed to follow suit, no nation would suffer an undue competitive disadvantage. \n\nSure it means some adaptation but a carbon tax will not only curb greenhouse gases but enhance the feasibility of green energy initiatives. Canada is as well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as any other country. An added bonus is that it will increase the competitiveness of local producers and encourage consumers to buy local.",
