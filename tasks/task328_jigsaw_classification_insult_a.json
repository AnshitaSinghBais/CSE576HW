The evidence says otherwise.  The girl who turned them in didn't know him.  The Grunwalds didn't know Eric. David's friends didn't know Erick.  David had a curfew and obeyed it and even asked permission for an extension for just an hour.  No kid like David plans to go drink for an hour and drive home drunk to waiting parents.  Military parents at that.  The fact that you are so inarticulate and illogical indicates you're cut from the same cloth of the Almandingers -- if not Rod himself.  You are jealous of good people like the Grunwalds.  Erick had to make David pay for having a better life than he did.  You're as sick as Erick is.",

Look you imbecile, the round for the AR-15 is pretty close to the .22 caliber round commonly found in walmart, and any other sporting goods place. It's notable because it's a cheap, small caliber round that is useful if you want to plink cans, bottles, coyotes, rabbits, etc.  Used against a person, it could injure or kill, but not as badly as all the other caliber rounds, less the .17 cal.  There's nothing particularly powerful about the weapons he used. My 700 ADL uses a  .30-06 round and is much more powerful, and expensive to buy. A .30-06 incidentally is about the average size rifle round one would use for deer or elk. Your statement alone shows just what kind of an ignoramus and a tool you really are. He used a small caliber repeating rifle, the kind you would likely take with you to shoot squirrels or rabbits. That's all it is. What makes it massively powerful in your eyes?",

Then there's the whole Putin ordering hacks & cyberattacks in order to interfere with & influence the presidential election in favor of Putrumpski - with whom Putrumpski colluded - And that included lots & lots of fake \"news\" about Hillary Clinton being a fraud and liar, among other despicable lies. Then there was ole' pathological liar Putrumpski himself and his merry band of liars and traitors spreading their made up garbage around.",

China has a new middle class they did not have three decades ago.  Our leadership has allowed the folks who benefited the most from this increase of wealth of China's middle class to affect our middle class.  We have cut taxes on the top, we have eliminated required retraining of workers put out of jobs, etc. due to the policies of the GOP.  Less taxes, less government.  Leave the market to the private sector.  The market has done well, the rich have done well with trade, it's just the fools who do not understand \"trickle down economics\" that have been hurt.

Technically, those VATS apply to all goods, but then both Mexico and CHina simply give tax breaks on the internally made stuff. \n\nIn fact, I would like to see us put the SAME tariffs on good from China that they put on our goods. When Clinton cut the deal with China, china had 98 tariffs, they are now over 500 and directed at western nations. \n\nMexico also has their fair share of taxes on our goods. BUT, unlike CHina, I think that NAFTA is worth saving and it is in our best interest to IMPROVE the deal, not simply wipe it out the way that the idiot/follower speak of. Canada and UK are 2 of our closets allies and we really should move Mexico up closer to us.

Alaska has long been the dumping ground of pedophile priests and scumbags from all points south to \"Start Fresh\" , and some of them just started fresh at their scumbag actions.   We have a long and successful history of Banishment to draw from.   Blue ticket these violent offenders and thieves out of Alaska and even things up a little.   Screw up....go away.   Take Alaska back from criminals.",

Is it actionable as such? Possibly. If it interferes with your neighbour's reasonable enjoyment of his property, then yes he could sue you over it.\n\nMore practically, I think this is going to have to be handled by municipalities the way that other common nuisances are handled - through bylaws. As it stands many municipalities have already outlawed through bylaw open air burning. In Toronto, for instance, you can't have a fire pit in  your backyard, although cooking appliances are exempted.\n\nAs I see it, similar rules could come into force if marijuana use becomes a serious nuisance.",

Your sources prove me correct -- ACORN was the victim of registration fraud by some of the workers it hired, who were paid by the card. Some took advantage in order to cheat ACORN out of more pay; ACORN however is legally obligated to turn all cards in (it's illegal to destroy any of them), ACORN self-reported the auspicious ones so they'd be checked out by the county clerks. That's how the system is supposed to work. The same registration fraud you blame on ACORN also was committee by Republican led registration drives. It happens, and it's caught.\n\nGilbert's case didn't implicate ACORN either. He wasn't registered twice by ACORN, rather he changed his address and the counties messed up.",

I just bought a new truck yet there were no government incentives to buy a fuel saving V6 yet lots of manufacturer incentives if I chose the V8. Why is that? Why not incentives to facilitate positive changes in behavior? \nWhy does the left always think another tax is a solution to every problem. Again, I think it is because they rely on government to think for them. Your child is overweight so the solution is a tax on soft drinks. What ever happened to sending your children outside to play? A tax on empty houses, why not offer incentives to ensure people want to rent out their spaces. \nThere.",

Christ's Church will not be on trial as a corporate entity.\nThe process will see individuals arraigned for what they have done and first and foremost the abusers will have to answer for their sins. Those who covered for them will be judged according to the levels of their culpability. \nRemember, this is the Last Judgement after which souls enter heaven, are consigned to purgatory or condemned to hell for all eternity.\nSinners, criminals and malefactors may escape punishment here on earth but cannot escape Divine Justice.

The assumption seems to be that the employer simply cannot terminate someone who is pregnant.  The laws around maternity/child care leaves are not designed to hold an employer hostage.  If there is another LEGITIMATE reason for ending employment, then the employer can act accordingly.  If the employee believes that the only possible reason for termination is her pregnancy, then by all means she should access the legal system including the Human Rights legislation applicable in her jurisdiction.  Also, she should not sign any release until this is resolved satisfactorily.  She may well have signed the release to access the severance payment, which other than for statutory amounts could be delayed significantly while each side is involved in the legal process.  The moral here  - don't sign off and expect a complaint to be heard later.",

Since when are 15 year olds, classified as child soldiers in this case, imprisoned in Guantanamo and subjected to torture for 10 years while their Canadian government wilfully chooses to ignore their plight?

That is, I presume his business affairs place him in an intractable conflict of interest, and that foreign powers will in fact patronize his businesses and favour his new business endeavors as a matter of course, placing Trump in objective violation of the American constitution.\n\nBut \"impeachable conditions\" and actual impeachment are very different animals. Given GOP control of congress, Trump will have to frustrate Republican legislators beyond their threshold of political endurance before impeachment is considered. And if/when that happens, the grounds of his impeachment will probably be unrelated to his actual \"crimes\" in frustrating legislators.",

Where does the government get the money?  It prints it.  They are inflating the money supply.  Inflated money supply means inflation.  Inflation with zero interest robs every Americans savings of many percentage points every year.  Inflation also reduces the value of the federal debt.

They don't think the debt. side of things and carry-on with high living expenses, smart phones and data plans, internet, eating out, nice vacations, etc. I feel for the ones that have made poor decisions relative to the size and style of house they decide to buy. Or the number of vehicles they feel they need to have. They'll learn like the rest of us that there is a tipping point where the debt becomes a burden. And hopefully they can avoid bankruptcy.",

This erodes savings and investment and it encourages borrowing and spending. The $20000 object which you borrowed to buy today (at 20% interest p.a over 5 years) was likely to cost you $100 000 cash in 5 years time, so it made sense to borrow now. Besides, you'd probably get double-digit pay-increases every year anyway, so the principal you'd borrowed was shrinking as a percentage of your income.\nToday OECD nations have reined in inflation so well (sitting around 1% p.a.) that they are now in danger of slipping into an even more destructive force: deflation. SA's inflation (near 7%) is still way too high to worry about deflation, so it needs to be hauled down lower.",

Was there hazing or stuff done to excess? Um, absolutely. Albeit nothing that could compare to the first month of parenthood or having to deal with a ridiculous coworker or living through a loved one fighting a terminal illness. In other words, life is messy. As an adult you have to make decisions about how to get through the messiness as well as who you want to be and how you want to live and be remembered. If you surround yourself with people who show empathy, compassion and concern—regardless of whether there's a label on it—you'll do OK. If you want to be a victim then you'll be a victim.

We as Canadians are just as greedy and blinded by illusion of being a real estate millionaire. When this bubble bursts and homes sell for 1 years wages then the real Einsteins will step into the market and buy them up like they did in the US, rent them out for reasonable rent for a typical return of 20% on their money and sell them 5 to 8 years later when the market recovers to 3 times earnings, just like the states.  We just came back from Florida, talked to numerous real estate agents and they are worried sick that they are getting over inflated at 3 times earnings. We can't change the direction of the wind, but we are going to change the way we put our sails!\nMy theory is that it is the domestic speculators that are causing the problem, look into it, you might be surprised!!!

The other measure of Arctic ice, using all three dimensions, is volume, the measure of how much ice there really is.\n\nAll data shows an obvious trend over the space of a decade or more, showing a decrease of about 5% of average sea-ice cover per decade.  It is clear from the various data sets, terrestrial and satellite, that both the sea ice extent and multi-year ice volume are reducing. Sea ice extent recovered slightly during the Arctic winters of 2008-09, but the full extent of annual ice reduction or gain is seen in September of each year, at the end of the Arctic summer. The volume of multi-year ice has not recovered at all, and is showing a steeply negative trend.",

Such high tax rates force those desiring to gain and keep great wealth to make smarter long term business decisions.

I’d say that’s an extraordinary commitment with lots of room for new found efficiencies, yet Gara proposes even more education spending with a “modest school tax!”. He proposes increasing the PFD by 25% while the state is running a $4 billion deficit. Brilliant, let’s go deeper in debt for political expediency.

Western countries are getting screwed by not controlling who comes in. I'm no fan of Trump, but he's right on this one. The DACA was NEVER supposed to be permanent, and CONGRESS needs to get laws in place to deal with this.  If the country (ie congress) decides they want to keep them because the country needs them, then that is what they will decide. At the same time, ALL illegal immigration should be stopped. If one wants to come legally, and has what the US wants out of that person, they'll be permitted to enter.  EVERY country has that right.  Enough with the sob stories.

The player was sad from losing, but he can laugh while going to the bank to deposit his very large check.\n\nWhat you should do is try for at least one contextual connection to make the idiom work.\n\nDid you just get paid for your paper route and you want to do some bragging? \nInvestigate context and learn how to use idioms correctly.",

Only 1 of the top 8 highest Muslim pop countries in the world even made the list and that was Obama's friends in Iran. The order leaves out 2/3 of the Muslim world but is a \"Muslim Ban\"?",

It's all a matter of who was dragging their feet on making the needed improvements to MP.\n\nAlso, let's not forget that it will be difficult to sell/buy in a building like MP that has active lawsuits.

My wife and her colleagues are close to burning out (my wife has had a total of 4 days off this year because of shortages) and these tax reforms are another slap in the face .  Many MDs will cut back their practices and spend time with their families, some are accepting jobs in the states (in Niagara we have lost 3 doctors this month to hospitals in NY state) and many will retire. In order to fix the problem caused by Trudeau/Morneau the provinces will end up spending billions more.

The insurance industry is unlikely to continue to provide risk protection for annually recurrent high cost drugs as incidence and expense increase with new medications.

It's fascinating to watch how she navigates it all.\n\nTwo outstanding acting jobs to look for. One is John Lithgow (yes, a yank!) as Winston Churchill. He's a little over the top at times, but ultimately he brings a touching vulnerability to his portrayal of the aging PM. \n\nThe other is Alex Jennings as the Duke of Windsor, the former Edward VIII. His scenes with Claire Foy’s Elizabeth are touching. Jennings plays him as a man who understands that the tragedy of his life is that he chose desire over duty, and that hers is that she’s done the opposite.\n\nSeason 2 coming in November.",

Na'i Aupuni's racist document he wrote is an attack on every island resident, not just me. It is an insult to everyone. Period.\n\nWhat do I think is right? Vote out the corporate prostitutes that control the State legislature and City Council and get people in there who actually malama ka aina a na kanaka would be a good start. Beyond that I don't really know. Less than half of voting age people in Hawaii are even registered, and less than half of them even bother to vote.",

Personally, it seems the number of mopeds that should have been addressed by this law has not diminished.  I continue to “hear”  them up and down Waialae (fill in the blank of your street) and observe many that do not have a moped license.  Few mopeds have a license and they're rather noticeable so HPD cannot use \"not visible enough\" as an excuse.  I guess HPD opts to determine what is law and what is not.  Sad.",

Put your partisan blinders up (and I'm sure this idea has flaws all its own), but I think it's a good starting point: Single-payer for all with something like a $50K deductible (no one knows what the real number should be, so for right now $50K is a placeholder). The government covers you for all expenses above $50K. Below that, you are on your own. Pay out of pocket or find an insurance to cover you below $50K. Totally free market and unregulated, with premiums no worse than car insurance. If you don't get that insurance, you can't bankrupt out of your medical bills.

On March 17, 2004, I arrived at LSA Anaconda/Balad Air Base nicknamed Mortaritaville.That was my base of operations and in that 11 months, I almost lost my life 3 times and numerous other occasions, where I witnessed rockets, remote IEDS vehicle borne IEDs, and mortars. \nIn 2005, I came back to America, my mother and my late wife said I was ANGRY! Those who have faced horror will never forget and will not entirely get over it. \n Like the Robert deNiro Character in the movie ,The Mission,  I am in constant internal debate about violence. Personally, I would use violence as the last resort.\nStill, we do need the military and police forces.

Mary's ultimate act of service in making her entire bodily existence available for the Incarnation is only possible through her uniqueness as a female. Her ultimate fidelity shown by standing at the foot of the Cross is a precisely maternal/feminine act as acknowledged by Christ's recognition of her as mother to John. \n\nIn a nutshell, women are of course capable of fulfilling the roles of those in Holy Orders. It goes deeper than that though in acknowledging the specific roles of men and women as male and female in salvation history. \n\nFinally, how exactly do you know God has other plans in view?
