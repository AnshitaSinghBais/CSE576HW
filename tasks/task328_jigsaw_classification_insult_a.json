Far be it from me to judge a person whoes life has been so affected by events like that. And far be it from Prevo to judge others for the same reason.  His own son has a failed marriage. Many religions consider divorce to be a sin.   And then there's the whole issue of \"Gay lifestyles\".  Seriously people, if you are a heterosexual, can you imagine any \"trend\" that would make you want to have sex with another member of your sex? It is a ridiculous and utterly stupid concept to call homosexuality a \"lifestyle\".  For those who think and read, there is a body of information from about 200 years of research that concludes there always has been a certain percentage of hmans who are born gay. It's just a biological fact.  It is NOT a choice.  So, with that being said, why do these paid interpreters of a story book keep trying to denigrate people for how they were born?",

LOL\nAccording to the (D)onkey tax accountant...\n\"A spokeswoman for the tax department said the new law raises the individual income tax rates for single filers making over $150,000 and joint filers making over $300,000, which is the top 1.2 percent of resident tax filers in Hawaii.\"\nHere's the breakdown...\nPopulation of Hawaii 1.432 million (2015) x 1.2% of the top earners = 17,184 residents earning $150k+ which means each of the 17,184 would have to pay an EXTRA average of $2,967 in STATE income taxes every year! Thanks for taking an extra $247 out of my pocket every single month. I'm sure the 300lb fat a$$ whale will desperately need my money to stuff Cheetos down his/her throat! The Banana Republic of Hawaii will realize the 17,184 will not be enough and then they'll lower the income threshold to $40k where 90% of the population will be deemed high income earners.",

After the convention approved the Great Compromise, Madison wrote: \"It seems now to be pretty well understood that the real difference of interests lies not between the large and small but between the northern and southern states. The institution of slavery and its consequences form the line of discrimination.\"\n\nTo imply nearly 100-years later(Civil War) what had been a monumental issue(slavery) in the creation of the USA was \nnow reduced to the North telling the South what do as the motivating factor for fighting by the southern soldiers is absurd.",

Just trying to shut the fossil fuel industry down (through their aboriginal group pawns) is a stupid, ignorant, simplistic approach that provides no solutions and no real avenue for improvement.

He is petty that way. His voters won't mind at all. Trump does not care enough to be a full blown racist. That takes work and focus. However, his minions are another matter.",

Check the article in The Guardian today on the criticism the Australian government is coming under from military and security leaders, for their abject lack of leadership on climate change.  Same could likely be said about Canadian leadership, Mr Wall being the loudest voice in support of continued wilful and selfish ignorance.  Time for climate change illiterates to get out of government.

Remember Reefer madness?   Just because the government says something, does not make it right.  The federal government should be resisted strongly when it does something wrong.  When did you become a big government fan?  Citizens really don't need the government telling them what they can and cannot do.  Tired of the Nanny state.",

As for social responsibility all governments impose this, its a matter of degree.  In communism governments confiscates everything while on the other extreme in libertarianism it lets people keep everything, but no such society exists.  Bernier would bring the top marginal rate down to 25% which if you add provincial rates would place the rich giving 39.7% to 46.7% to all levels of governments which is still quite significant.

Hence the clamor for change and hope which was either not understood or simply ignored by the political leaders.  Therefore the voters who opted for change no matter what put Donald Trump in the driver seat.   Second, we the people individually or communally have not been seriously involved with our government.  We just let things go. So there we are.  Good or bad, we deserve the kind of leaders and government we have.  If we have to blame someone or something, blame ourselves.

We recognize him as first -- but only as first among equals. He is the elder brother, not supreme ruler. We do not consider that, in the first ten centuries of the Church, the Pope possessed direct and immediate power of jurisdiction in the Christian east, and so we find it impossible to grant such power to him today.\" They wish to see the Pope's ministry and honorary seniority spelled out in pastoral terms, not juridical terms.",

The word being used in this discussion is doctrine. Do you differentiate between dogma and doctrine? \nThe Ten Commandments are so basic that nearly every society has owned them with perhaps some difference re the god to worship and when and how. But the do not steal, kill etc are pretty universal. Of course they are OT not new. As a child we were taught them but I confess as an adult I reflect more on the NT and particularly Jesus' sayings like the sheep and goats and the sermon on the mount/plain. I also frequently think of God's continual request of the people of Israel to worry less about their sacrifices etc and more about caring for the poor: the widows and orphans and the aliens in their midst. These were the people without status in their society: widows and orphans because they had no man to stand up for them and aliens who were not citizens.",

Dix brought that all together masterfully.\n\nSince then, Roman liturgists appear to know much less about other rites, especially the Byzantine. Since all liturgical renovations moved from East to West--from Jerusalem to Byzantium to Rome--for Roman scholars to not know about Byzantine developments is to not understand oneself.\n\nHere is a perfect example.\n\nThe present Easter Vigil is a very long service, consisting of three major parts: (1) a Liturgy of the Word with uniquely seven readings, (2) an extended Baptism and Confirmation Service, and (3) the Eucharist.\n\nThis liturgy was adopted from the Byzantine Easter Vigil in the 8th century, with one fundamental misunderstanding.",

And during the initial start up for the testing, some material debris (common to new construction) caused several key traps to fail, which caused condensation to build in the steam main which caused the main to start hammering. And thanks to the hammering, they determined faulty components of the system, corrected those problems and reinstalled the relief valve prior to regular operation of the system.

This would help people with entry level positions, and help business owners that are having difficulty getting by.  Then offset the cuts to lower earners by increasing  taxes on higher earners.  Lets be serious, someone earning $200,000 a year isn't going to notice another $5000...I know they are taxed heavily as it is, but I think they will be okay.  Plus this should help pull some dollars from the business owners who effectively abuse the system by paying only minimum wage and take millions in profits for themselves...it happens, I know a few.

I don't think anyone, married or celibate, should be ordained before 40 without special circumstances. Men with families should be ordained only after the children are grown. The pressure on clergy families is immense, and the children deserve a normal childhood. The word \"presbyter\" from which \"priest\" comes has Greek roots associated with \"old man\", suggesting that the earliest \"priests\" were elders, not 20-somethings. But for this change to work, the role of priest as the primary leader of the church must change, too, so he can work outside the parish and let laity control more community services and functions. This would equalize power and make the parish a true body where many gifts are recognized and used. Married clergy without an older ordination age and  change in lay roles would solve only part of the problem.  Celibate or married makes no difference.",

He is pragmatic, thoughtful, and sincere. He is honest and open with all Canadians, and not afraid in the least to discuss his failings with disappointed Canadians from anywhere, about anything, and regardless of ideology.\n\nHe's not perfect, and I hope in time he gets some elocution coaching (Sophie?) to get him over the habit of vocalizing his pauses, but his heart is in the right place. He loves Canada and does his best for all Canadians. There is necessarily an ideological side to his Liberal politics, but really, it is remarkably subtle and understated.

One researcher is quoted as not agreeing with that assessment but she also admits the kids are throwing out fruits and vegetables but as long as they're eating some of them, that's better than nothing...which I kinda find funny.

The so-called 'salafi' movement, including \"ISIS\", which was largely armed and financed by the US, are a hateful bunch of murderous ignoramuses--we called their like \"Kharijites\" in the old days--who take the position that anyone who disagrees with them should be killed.

The exception were those who were fleeing from felony offences. Second, it's churlish. Average wages throughout Latin America are low. And none of the other countries offer universal health care, free education and subsidized living expenses.\n\nYou could paint a bleak picture of Canada too if all you did was focus on negative things. But what counts is the overall package in comparison to other states. The primary reason Canada does so well economically is because we are the USA's biggest trading partner.

There's nothing remotely slum-like about her home with a loft.\n\nWe probably agree that our building codes need to be upgraded and enforced. However, allowing people to use ladders to access sleeping quarters is where we may have to agree to disagree.",

The rifle is carried loaded and cocked, with the safety engaged.  The hunter takes his stance, disengages the safety, takes final aim, and fires.  This should be done in three seconds, and if the hunter is competent, the first shot will result in the animal's death within another ten seconds.\n\nAfter the kill, the firearm should have been unloaded.

The idea was to allow rents to be raised to market value; the reality was landlords finding any excuse to evict tenants in order to rent to a new tenant at a higher rent. The newly created rent tribunal assisted landlords greatly in this endeavour. Result was a massive increase in homelessness, documented in the Golden Report on Homelessness and Poverty.  Harris' other action was to stop the Ontario government from building new rental housing, which also coincided with Ottawa getting out of building affordable housing. TCHC then decided that salaries and head office renovations took precedence over repairs and thus we have the current crisis. .",

Also, it seems quite reasonable that people who feel threatened by a Trump administration would become more sensitive to behaviors and so confirmation bias would lead them to perceive an increase in \"targeting\".  At the same time, people who seem to feel threatened by these people groups would tend to feel that they could rely upon the new administration to \"deal with those people\" and so would be less likely to take actions into their own hands.   Certainly there have been a great many \"false flag\" activities in the last few weeks, where tagging, bullying and vandalism have been found to have been performed by members of the groups that are feeling \"unsafe\".

For the bishops, I cannot imagine such a malaise could be good for the church.  Yet, they (the church's leadership) do not give the laity a voice, nor any power here.  I cannot imagine most Catholics being \"happy\" with the church's response.  That it draws anger could even be seen as good, because it means the church's members still care, and feel \"vested\" in it.  As that sense fades towards apathy, anything the bishops do or do NOT do will no longer matter.  We're disconnecting.  We may/may not still attend, but that real sense of being part of something good will fade...  THAT should scare these guys...",

Add to that the impact of non-strategic tax deductions and the lowering of taxes on corporations and you see where the blame for deficits lies.  That \"balanced\" budget claim?  Totally artificial created by short changing programs and delaying spending that was mandated by law until after the election in 2015.

About $3.2 billion per year. (ConocoPhillips' quarterly reports) BP, and Exxon are producing for OPEC countries at $1 per barrel plus costs. If the Legislature cut their $17 to $3.76 per barrel their Alaska profits would exceed their international average, and Alaska would receive an additional $2.5 billion. Ten years ago I helped the FBI bust 6 legislators for taking bribes to give our oil away. For 6 years the big 3 lost control and Alaska saved up $16 Billion; the savings this Legislature is reaching into to cover the deficit; savings now depleted because we're once again giving oil away. Why would Alaska's legislators agree to pay four and one half times more than a fair market payment for production services? bribery is only one logical answer.",

If the State Legislature succumbs to pressure from the city and SA and approves an extension of the rail surcharge, watch next year’s cost estimate blow past $10 billion on its way to $12 billion. Conversion to maglev will enable completion of the project with available funding. If the state and city will not conduct a comprehensive rail review, the only hope for a fiscally responsible solution will be federal intervention.

Mexican-Canadian relations is somewhat of a mystery since the US is a lynch pin for both, and without America where it leaves Mex-Can is up in the air. Enter Jagmeet Singh into the mix. Perfect opportunity for the new NDP leader to present his grand strategy for the party. I believe the biggest real problem for NAFTA is the low wages of Mexican workers. Its in this area the NDP has an opening. Unions in Canada have for decades offered opinions of how to increase worker wages in Mexico.

However sometimes the camps will refuse to compromise and will not allow for any flexibility thus disrupting the cooperative humanistic process inside Trudeau's mind. That is when Mr. Trudeau gets confused and in that moment, if he is at a press conference or at a town-hall meeting he makes mistakes and says things that don't make sense.

Batter the forest ... or if job opportunities are down... your spouse and kids. Sheesh, that was one of the most frightening studies I had ever heard this professor discuss.\n\nPerhaps it should be required that loggers study and apprentice in sustainable forestry before learning how to use a chainsaw or greenchain.
