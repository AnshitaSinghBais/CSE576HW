For example, under the new rules if a farmer wants to pass their farm down to a child, it will incur either a 56% or 71% tax on that transfer, but they could sell the farm to a foreign owner and only pay 26%. How is that fair? \n\nYet a bank CEO can still sell their millions in stock options at 26%. If they are truly trying to target \"the rich\", then the rules should apply across the board. \n\nMost smart business owners have money kept in their businesses in case of a downturn to be able to pay the wages of their employees, taxes, benefits, and utilities. If that money is invested, it is already taxed at the top marginal rate of 53%. The new rules would now equal 65%+ tax on that money.\n\nWhen a business earns income they pay a small tax rate on that initial income. When it is paid out as salary or a dividend, more tax is paid at that person's marginal tax rate, and it falls in line with the current tax guidelines.",

SAP has been clear from the outset that it will not tolerate misconduct or wrongdoing.â\nWhat were the rules before the Board decided to eliminate sales commissions?

Aside from oil, there is little Alberta has other than tourism and real estate that could be the foundation of balanced trade with Asia. The NDP may think it can make viable export businesses happen but the record on such efforts is little short of dismal. Inviting what Chinese capital is available to establish operations in Alberta may create a few jobs but the accompanying concessions will make them very expensive for taxpayers. In the meantime, trainloads of Chinese manufactured cheap consumer goods will keep rolling in.

Whidbey Environmental Action Network has watched as time-after-time developers have gotten variances and waivers and exceptions allowing butchering or outright removal of Oaks. A classic example: a development design by a Seattle architect that never even visited the site and the presence of Oaks was a \"surprise\" for which the developer got a variance. The dawn massacre of the post office Oak was not an exception.  \n\nThank you Garry Oak Society. May I suggest that you partner with the high school Ecology Club and map the remaining Oaks in the City? Send a copy to the City and developers will no longer be able to claim \"ignorance\" of the presence of Oaks. As for this particular situation, reasonable use may not be granted if the situation was caused by the person trying to make the claim. See OHMC 20.12.060(4)(d).",

A recent septic-tank hole in a major stream bottom showed thick charcoal layers from major fires in about every two feet of sediment, as deep as the backhoe dug. Some naturalists are saying that most wildfires shouldn't be fought, but allowed to burn through the fuels.

I bet 90% of the time, that's what happens.\nThis 19-year-old got drunk, got separated from her friends or got dumped by them, walked into the walk-in freezer and, sheer speculation, either collapsed from being drunk or, if the freezer closed after her, was too foggy to figure out a way to release the latch.\nI've been in a walk-in refrigerator once. It was in a church kitchen with someone else, and they kept the refrigerator door open so I could fetch something. Do walk-in refrigerators or freezers have safety latches like fire doors do?",

Juneau gets a million cruise tourists a year, so sales tax revenue is likely higher there than it would be elsewhere.  In reality the state sales tax would need to be 6% or more.\n2.  Many out-of-state owned businesses skip town without remitting their taxes.  Difficult to enforce when the business is operating in the Virgin Islands or whatever winter cruise port.  It's a perennial problem there.\n3.  A state sales tax would be piled on top of existing municipal sales taxes in the communities that have them (i.e. Juneau would have a 10% sales tax).  So they would have to switch to higher property taxes which the sales tax supporters would probably consider even less fair.\n\nIf you just gotta have a sales tax, make it a big one only in the summer season.",

It's for political expediency and highlights once again that Liberals are corrupt at heart and cannot be trusted. Canadians have lost an opportunity for democratic modernization that they clearly voted for at election time.  Flanagan is right one this one. It will not be forgiven by progrsseive voters.  It's handing the Conservatives a big wedge. Big mistake.",

When you have a child who dies because they were not able to get any health care, perhaps you would temper your criticism a little. Do you have a job, insurance, vacation and sick pay? Congress was exempt because federal employees do have employer sponsored health insurance, same as any other employer offered plans, not because they specifically exempted themselves.

Thus if we knew that information, we would become nothing more than whatever God would have us be rather than individuals of free will who choose to love God, which is in fact what He wants us to be, therefore causing a worse paradox. God made us perfectly, knowing the outcomes, but gave us the choice. If we choose hell instead of God, the only criticism we have left is to ask why He bothered creating us at all?

Because they have to compete in the employee market for acceptable licensed practitioners like everyone else in their industries.   Their employees are not all Catholic--nowhere near it and they want normal commercial insurance benefits.  These institutions are hospitals & universities, public corporations much like any others.  They'll charge you every bit as much for that procedure as they will your atheist buddy at work.

I took care of her as long as I could, but getting up there in years myself, she is now gone through all most all of her money for care in the last two years. So, do we just put our old people in the street once their hard earned money is gone? Is this who we are? There is nothing \"generous\" in Medicaid.  I was stranded in Anchorage with a foster child who just had surgery on her knee some years back. Medicaid provided a voucher that wouldn't pay even half of a hotel room in the summer.

Government policies (not just regulations and laws, i.e. ESA) have lead to the virtual cessation of logging on these forests.  It is indeed a testament to the \"industry\" that innovation and modernization  in both production and products has been able to  maintain as many jobs as there are given that the raw material supplies have been reduced to a fraction of what it used to be and what the potential is.

Governors do zero.  Shipping companies are in a bankrupting shipping slump which is a result of  US and world recession.  Industry consolidates,  and continues to do so today,  and the result is doubling the size of container ships to depress fuel and labor costs to half of current on a per 20' container basis.  Columbia River,  port,  cannot handle the super container ships. \n\nSo where was/is the long term planning?  Was there any?  Or is the Port all about the airport?

Whoever is left becomes the BU and when their contract ends in 3yrs, then we see who wants to stay as BU and who wants to try to start elsewhere.

It is ironic that within a year prior to the 2016 renewal of the inflation-control agreement deposed CPIX measure as the operational guide, the CPIX inflation rate had been as high as 2.2%, much higher than any of the three new measures. Now in April it is at 1.1%, lower than any of them! Oddly, one of the reasons for that is its greatest strength: it is the only core measure that excludes mortgage interest cost. Its annual inflation rate was -1.5% in April 2016 but in April 2017 it finally rose to 0.0%. No other central bank in the entire world has a preferred core inflation measure that is sensitive to mortgage interest rates; Morneau and Poloz should be ashamed of themselves that the Bank of Canada now does so.",

Either remove the double taxation from all or make the REITâs pay. This is especially troubling for the state of Hawaii where so much money is derived from real estate. The council on revenues has come up short on projections of late and bewildered why. Well, when Alexander and Baldwin no longer files state income taxes for 2017 and beyond, at least they will know why... In addition, this gives REITâs additional buying power since they can also re-allocate a portion of income towards additional purchases of property and defer what would otherwise be taxable profits into more assets.

If the defense didnât badger Mr. Campbell about his credentials (are you sure about that?) it was likely a strategic move, as his resume was impressive & it would have appeared that they were grasping at straws. There were many other data points during the seven 35-hour weeks of the trial of that were just as significant (some more so) than the testimony of Dr. Babrauskas and Mr. Campbell.

Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

I ask you, do you realize the counterproductive arrogance of such an approach to communication? I'd be most happy to sit down face-to-face w/you to civilly discuss this issue.   I'm in the book.

Instead they Pick, Click, Give away their dividends for a much needed tax deduction and they won't miss the money either way.

Yea - that seems like a better solution.\n\nAlso, the mandate to purchase insurance goes hand in hand with making it so insurers are unable to deny someone coverage due to a preexisting condition.  \n\nMaybe you can explain to me why the US Healthcare system has been ranked one of the lowest compared to all other prosperous countries around the world (#53 currently), and has been for decades?  \nhttps://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2016-legatum-prosperity-index-pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=2",

Good luck getting your groceries shipped in if the Coast Guard wasn't out there installing and maintaining aids to navigation.

So all that's happening is, instead of people paying their premiums to the insurance company then the insurance pays the provider, people will pay the government and the government will pay the provider. It's if Anchorage started providing internet to residents. It would cost more in taxes, but probably less than we are currently paying GCI or whoever.

For his part, Trump steadfastly refuses to say a single critical thing about Putin, despite the growing evidence of Russian involvement in swaying the election and the growing mound of dead Russian bodies that could point fingers. California is becoming ground zero for resisting Trump's environment destroying executive orders, the courts are stymieing Trump's Muslim bans and Republicans have outed him as in ineffectual negotiator and called his bluff on empty threats to hold a vote on Trumpcare. Trump golfs more than Obama did, after criticizing Obama for it. He still refuses to release his taxes, after mocking Romney for delaying release of his during the 2012 race. He is wildly behind in staffing many critical administration positions and his existing skeleton staff largely lack experience. This so called administration is a joke.",

(both factions have expressed racist views, so that's another commonality between the two factions.) also, we see a new monkey survey showing 49% of americans believe charlottesville violence was a result of either both sides (40%) or counter protestors (9%)...compared to 46% placing the blame solely on \"far right\" groups.  seems to me like the premise might be a little slanted and not reflective of actual observation.",

Having no moral restraints, they quickly decide they have found a sufficient paying/low effort vocation. I'll be happy to pay a few dollars more to significantly lower the rate at which this happens.

As an oil & gas man, it's not surprising that you support oil pipelines, gas pipelines, LNG plants, etc. and I've seen you trash any cause that matters to First Nations. Your're quick to condemn 'Southern BC' and Gregor Robinson. 'Elites' are they?\n\nWhy do you assume that Gregor Robinson is a supporter of the Site C project? That seems uncharacteristic of his politics. Any proof? Are you unaware of his background as an organic farmer and supporter of food security issues? He is fully aware of the importance of the Peace River agricultural land . \n\nGregor Robinson, like most of the opponents of Site C, happens to be from the Lower Mainland. We didn't sacrifice the Peace and many of us actively oppose the dam project. The Site C proponents are a small group of BC Liberals in Victoria. Perhaps you should be a little better informed before  you lash out.",

You are correct that this article reflects Japanese values, which has become synonymous with local culture, and how our state operates.  In a not too distant past, state workers were predominantly Japanese.  There also was a glass ceiling for non-Japanese (if you managed to get in), and an expectation of \"enryo\" or restraint as it relates to diverse opinions.\n\nAs it relates to Chelsea Kent she (and others) brought diverse and a progressive agenda to our local Democratic Party.

Both systems are setup so that you can't have the most populous regions of the country completely dominate elections by giving a bit more say to rural areas.  Hillary lost because she could not win enough states with a plurality of electors.  If she ran up the totals in New York and California but still lost then the system is working as designed.  She needs to win more than just the big states and she didn't win enough of those.  Questions about the electoral collage are foolish.

Level two where the parent taking the child is known to have a history of unfit behavior and has been forbidden to see the kid, or not without supervised visits. Level one is very serious where, for instance,  the child is abducted by a stranger.\n\nActually, for level three it would be very annoying to get an alert.",

We also believe God's grace can be lost through persistent sin. \n\nIt's good you are acknowledging that LGBT people are \"hurting, afraid ... often alone\" and \"broken\". All of us are sinners and everyone in search of support from a parish community and grace through the proper reception of the sacraments, are very welcome. As I understand 12 step fellowships, people who attend acknowledge their weaknesses and are seeking to amend their lives. Can this be said for all LGBT persons?

In violation of Army regulations, Michael Flynn was on RT's payroll and concealed his Russian income while he was being vetted to become Trump's national security advisor. A national security advisor who worked for a Russian propaganda network that collaborated with a hostile intelligence service was no problem for Trump. After being briefed by Sally Yates (whom he quickly fired) about Flynn's lies to Pence, Trump withheld that knowledge from Pence for 17 days, revealing his collusion with Flynn only when Pence learned about the lies in the Washington Post.",

If CAPP's first prediction of 4.83 Mb/d is reached, there will be a 2.67 Mb/d or more of excess capacity. With the recently approved Kinder Morgan and Line 3, the capacity will reach around 4,982 Mb/d, which would be more than sufficient to carry all the crude produced in Western Canada until at least 2030.

From what I can gather from recent media coverage of the drought, the weather patterns have also had an adverse effect on rainfall. These two factors, coupled with the unavoidable amount of time needed to plan and build new dams and reservoirs has created the 'perfect storm'. However, there is room for improvement and I'm sure Patricia is aware of the challenges and is formulating emergency measures to prevent a disaster. The ANC has no room to talk - 21 years after they took over we were still having rolling blackouts.",

The drug is also used to treat Dementia, Post-concussion syndrome, brain injury and tumors, complex partial seizure, to name a few.\n\nIt is now also known that Clinton also had her senior advisor Philippe Reines contact the NFL Commissioner in 2012 to inquire about her \"severe head injuries.\"\n\nClinton continually refuses to show her medical records and has yet to call any press briefings on her Foundation or her ailing health.",

A solution that appears to work better, as measured by the abortion rate, is to give that woman Hope, by providing free kindergarten, buttressing the Earned Income Tax Credit, and showing that woman that by our country's investing in innovation, there will be a job out there for her kid. Not to make this a political argument, but it is under Democratic presidents (Obama) that the abortion rate fell to its lowest level ever.

I'm being generous here, and basing this on the number of homes actually sold, which is considerably less than that each month. Now compare that with the number of home-owners in the GTA, who are happily watching the value of their biggest investment going up, and who will not be happy to see the party stop. Those homeowners number in the hundreds of thousands, at the very least, but likely in the millions. Now which group do you suppose the Liberals would rather keep happy, if they are rational?\nI don't know the situation in Vancouver.

AND pass the required exams and boards.  If they didn't finish or didn't measure up when the time came, they would be on the hook for the full costs of their education.  This would appeal to those truly wanting to teach, with a reward for actually taking advantage of a great opportunity, and being willing to work for it:  The reward being a free education.",

He's in the process of forming the most blatantly corrupt administration in the history of the United States. His ignorance of and contempt for the Constitution are obvious.  He will be impeachable from Day 1 -- but I doubt that he'll be impeached.  The process requires integrity in the Congress, especially in the members of the president's own party. It was the integrity of the Republicans in Congress that brought Nixon down.  I don't see anything remotely close to that courage or integrity in this Republican Congress.\nHowever, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump quits at about the halfway mark. He's massively unqualified for the job and he's going to be bored. He'll suck what he can from it and walk away. Pence would finish Trump's term and be eligible to run for two of his own.",

This means their contribution has already been taken from their overtime pay. It is up to management to correct the pension spiking.

Supervisor would get pressure from their unions if they attempted to scale back the overtime.  This is one reason FDR was right when he said public employees should be non-union. The sickleave/overtime game can be corrected if management was willing to stand up to the unions.
