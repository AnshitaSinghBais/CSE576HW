I suppose to you, that when a woman accepts donations for her time, while having sex with you, she technically isn't a prostitute.\n\nNo matter what epiphany she had (proof I read the entire speech) later on, the fact that she referred to him as a separate kind, is clearly a sign of latent racism in the lefty playbook.  However, she didn't need to be fired, you can blame that on Obama not Breitbart.",

These are your 'sunnis' that you are protecting. Hillary has already admitted that we know KSA and Qatar fund ISIS in the region.  You support these sunnis, but in Syira, and Iran anyone is free to practice their religion.  How many churches are in KSA? Thats right, 0\n4) Most importantly, the overwhemingly majority of Syria supports Assad.  Most of Assads army is made of sunnis.  So the rebels are jihadis",

Hey, Dana Altman, you recruited a player who was under investigation for sexual assault at his previous school and then you either lied about knowing this or were incompetent for not knowing.

Now you want to play it off as people just didn't believe in you? Go to hell, you selfish bastard! 1 in 4 women will be raped in their lifetimes. 1 in 10 women at the U of O will be raped in their time at university--this is a true horror.

And as for patrolling the Seward Highway, it's a state owned road. Let them patrol it. If they have a problem with that, they can turn over the Glenn and Seward highways to the Muni and we will put a damn toll booth at either end of the Muni to fund patrols and maintenance.

And rather supports my fundamental belief - that socialism was, in fact, a fantastic idea. It shouldn't be taken dogmatically - some things are better done by a market and should be. However, dictatorship is a terrible idea and will be terrible no matter what kind of economy it has. Do you really think any of the tens of thousands of people Pinochet killed went to to their deaths thinking \"At least the brutal dictator who killed me is an almost libertarian capitalist and not one of those evil communists ones like Stalin\" ?\n\nDemocracy, when functional, actually naturally leads to socialism because government by the people will, inevitably, put the needs of the majority of people above the needs of a wealthy elite. America is a prime example of democratic theater with no actual democracy anymore. Democracy is what makes socialism work.",

Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him. If this were Lynch's first season with the team, I'd agree with your logic but I believe his leash will be shorter - especially since it is also tethering the new coaches and possibly higher.",

The Washington Post called 13 of those families at random - and 7 confirmed having received some kind of communication from the white house (in 3 cases - just a letter, no call). So - he flagrantly lied yet again. Based on the WaPo's sample - he's barely done 50% of what he claims to have done.\nIn an even more bizarre twist he personally promised the father of another fallen soldier 25-thousand dollars (by his own account: it was to come from his personal funds). A weird response to a request to reform the bereavement fund. But then on top of it, Trump BROKE that promise. The father called him \"a damn liar !\". \nSarah Huckabee Sanders responded by saying: \"the cheque is in the mail\". WTF ?",

Rather than seek to negotiate as favorable a transition as possible, likely including compensation for emancipated slaves, the South chose to secede.  It's no surprise that most the young men in the South chose to support secession. They were raised in the South and slavery was part of the values system of their lives.  ....and, yes, those damn Yankees were going to end slavery.  Gary Crum",

In fact , they too often roll the dice with flying in bad weather, they overload their planes , they often don't fill out flight plans , or check to make sure they have enough fuel .  The concern they have for their innocent passengers lives seems too low.   Nearly every time after one of these crashes we hear the same story---pilot error .  I wish Alaska pilots cared more for those they take with them and the families left behind due to poor choices they made. It breaks my heart to see so many innocent passengers lose their lives.",

Exit/join it does not matter. It will be so messy the result is worse. So prepare for collapse. \n\n2) Scotland don't want Brexit. Indeed it is ready to exit if Brexit happen. Well, Scotland can do a referendum and simply exit the UK. If Crimea, an autonomous state of Ukraine, has the guts to do it surely the brave Scots can. Don't worry about American propaganda - such a referendum is legal. \n\n3) Now that Scotland exited, what's next? Join EU? Ain't going going to happen. Spain and others will veto. I do suggest Scotland join Russia, just like Crimea. Russia will protect it well. And yes, don't worry about the nonsense hoopla about being 'annexed' by Russia.

This is doable if the provinces and feds cooperate to make all RE transactions contingent on a thorough review of income tax filings of the purchaser. That's the only way to know if Canadian income tax has been fully paid on all the money being used for the purchase. Money from outside Canada would only be suitable if it was duly taxed in a country that has a fair tax agreement with Canada. \"Gift\" money would only be suitable if one could show the source, and that source's income tax filings revealed tax duly paid in Canada or in a country with a fair tax agreement with Canada.  No sale if taxes paid aren't commensurate with the RE purchase price.",

Also, one can see the roots of the current situation in decisions made at that time. Trump is a natural culmination of many Republican racial policies; he is different because he said openly what the Republicans had been saying with dog whistles since Nixon introduced the Southern strategy. The Trump situation also seems to be a very deliberate effort to roll back many of the gains made by minorities over the past 40 years. One way in which Trump is absolutely unique is that he has put forward a foreign policy that undermines most of the post-WWII consensus in US politics. Whether or not he will act on this remains to be seen,  but his anti-free trade, leadership by extortion message is a marked departure and has many American allies reconsidering their reliance on the US.",

Funny thing was, I went to the security office close by, and they don't give change.  Their suggestion was to go into the building where they have a convenience store, purchase something (after waiting in line for ID check, then waiting in line again to exit), then get change....assuming that no one will come by to ticket my car for an expired meter in the mean time.

Because black lives mattered.Not because they had to bare the burden of redeeming every racist white person involved with hate based crimes. They instead acknowledged the color of their skin afforded them a level of privilege and treatment not afforded to the black communities. They utilized their privledge and worked together with Black leaders to establish the NAACP and their message of equal rights.

Go to the Alaska Department of Revenue website and find the Revenue Sources Book, which will show income from land sales.  Look at the RSBs for, say, the past five years to get an average of revenue from land sales.  Even if you could double the sales--which you couldn't--the revenue from land sales would still be woefully insufficient to close the budget gap.  Nobody wants to buy land that isn't surveyed, so the state would have to pay for that, and the state has other staff to manage sales so they're fair and legal.

Someone like Rob Portman embodies some of this. I still say Trump has killed Ryanism & the deep entitlement cuts Ryan has championed. And while I largely agree w/ Gerson & others like David Frum, don't forget that they  shoulder some blame as the architects & voices of a failed Iraq War that totally discredited \"Compassionate Conservatism\" & created a void for Trump.

This whole tragic fiasco makes one wonder what year London is living in -- 1905?\n\nIf anything good comes out of this it will be a grave reminder of just how important strong fire and building codes are, along with strong enforcement of those codes.   The U.S. had its very own Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston in 1942 in which 492 people lost their lives due to terrible fire safety in the nightclub.   That was a wake up call for us.  Unfortunately, people tend to forget these tragedies and safety can be replaced by cost-saving measures and cutting corners...",

They were talking about how to present this to the public and get it sold.  Kennedy told him never to talk about projected costs over future years, because the public would see that the programs were a drain and they'd never fund it.  So, they limited the talk to the first couple years where the problems didn't show.\n\nWelcome to the world of government.",

At that point I emailed the urls for IBM reference manual discussion to the brightest bulb in the bunch and went to bed. The next morning the highly visible service outage had been resolved. Niche skills or simply having read and remembered the manual? At the last local CIPS dinner my wife and I attended we had to bite our tongues when a contractor objected to not being paid for the time spent taking a tech course paid for by a client. So it goes in contractor land.",

Since Rep. Luke has rejected the settlement to which the State agreed, she has forced the court to decide the issue, and the cost (including the attorneys fees that the State will be obligated to pay in full if it loses at trial, which is likely) will very likely be substantially higher than the figure set forth in the settlement.

Our society tends  to blame people with addictions, saying things like, they need to take responsibility for there actions. Alcoholism is a disease and requires treatment, and it isn't the persons fault.\nThat's not to say a person is pewerless, or unable to change their behaviour. It means society can't just say \"stop drinking\" for the same reason you can't tell someone with depression \"stop being sad\" and expect it to work.\nSometimes, addiction is a symptom and treating the underlying (depression, anxiety, other) mental health issue removes the addiction with very high success. It's like, removing the hurt that makes someone want to be numb, instead of saying that the numbing (drinking) itself is the problem.\nOne may find that positive psychiatry helpfull, it folcuses on what makes you well using your own values, instead of another's.",

Al Queda, with the support of the Taliban in Afghanistan, fell directly in the Pres. line of fire.  The polls that were run at that time had 94% of this Great Nation favoring the Presidents policy.  Reading some of the comments here I wonder if we still have the intestinal fortitude to stay the course in our war against terrorism.  That would be so very sad if it has come about.  We not only MUST stay the course, but we also MUST support our troops in any conceivable way possible as they fight to make our Country safer as well as our planet.

We try to limit our membership to about 40 people because at a certain point, you wind up creating structures and duplicating the very problems we're trying to resolve. So when we get to 40 or so members, we break off a group and start again with a core of ten or fifteen.\n\nThat means we're always getting inquiries from potential new members, who often come to us with questions about their churches. As you can imagine, one of the questions we hear frequently is about the church's position on divorce and remarriage. We make every effort to not exploit the church's situation in order to get new members, but therein lies the problem: we don't know what to say is the church's position at the moment, and AL is not as helpful as we'd like. Since we don't want to exploit folks, we have to send them back to clergy we know will help them, but what happens after that?",

This, apparently, is true, as Mr Trump's denials are now mute. Two, there is no way that Mr Trump or anyone else can say that this interference was, or was not, effective. Three, by saying that 'hacking did not affect the election outcome' Mr Trump is communicating that he believes (with ample good reason) that the people he expects to be listening are fools.\n\nI get the impression that Mr Trump was under the assumption that 'hacking' was some sort of technical wizardry akin to black magic, and as such could never be 'proven'.

Other pitchers get called for it, which awards a base to the batter and all runners. White, having been an elite pitcher, can spot pitchers who leave the ground and often asks the umps to call it. Opposing coaches probably hate him for it. The fact is, the rule exists for a reason, but it is enforced rarely and unevenly, which is bad for the game. White makes a good point.",

Another reason is when you have a kid from a poor family that had the opportunity to go to a private school like Kamehameha, Punahou, or Iolani, it's a big thing because there are more college opportunities to folks that go to these schools versus some public schools and if they work hard, some of them can actually pull their families out of poverty into the middle class or better if they end up with a good job.",

My husband has not been able to hold onto a job, steadily, for a few years now.. Not for lack of trying and not for lack of ability, just due to bad luck. When my mom died, her best friend moved in and we had made a deal about rent vs taxes. I thought she had been being paid and they hadn't been. When she fell behind on rent for 3 months we evicted her (by this time my brother that absolutely *needed* care, was living elsewhere) and we walked into a situation where the house was in foreclosure. Between all of those things, the depression, lack of employment, property taxes, etc, the yard has kind of taken a back burner. Someone mentioned being neighborly, that doesn't seem to be a thing in this neighborhood. People are quick to judge. I don't even know any of my neighbors, They sure didn't hesitate to comment for the paper though, which btw, happy father's day!",

Francis is starting with trying to get bishops to really to be courageous in speaking what their experience tells them and seeing what the Church needs for today, for the state of the faith in the world as it is.  He is also encouraging them to reach out to the people, the laity, who live in the reality of today and to listen to them.  I don't believe the institutional Church can survive without the input of laity.  The bishops simply do not live in the reality that Catholics experience in their day-to-day lives.  \n\nSooner or later, they will have to open up all the doors that are closed and let the laity in.",

The OIA's apparent reasoning is that if it basically locks the gate and doesn't permit some kids on the field or court, the kids and their famiies will do what they want (stay in public schools).  That isn't going to happen.  The perception of public schools in Hawaii is bad. That's why the preference, for those given the opportunity, is to take the shot at private school.  Whether it is to go to Div. 1 St. Louis, Punahou or Kamehameha, or admittedly Division 2  Iolani or Damien.  Locking the gate and not letting the good players in doesn't enhance the game, or make the players let in better.  It just diminishes the game.  The important game is not on the field or court.   That's the tragedy in all of this.  OIA parents should be crazy made with the DOE and OIA over doing this and not addressing the underlying problem(s).",

The laws Denver has passed that limit voluntary cooperation with ICE are aimed at making Denver safer, because when local police work hand in hand with immigration, people in the immigrant community, and their friends who are citizens, refuse to cooperate with police in fighting crime. That's bad for people whose cars are stolen, homes broken into, etc., because people who have information to solve those cases stay silent so their friends won't be deported. Every city in America knows this. Immigration problems are caused by Congress' failure, not cities where immigrants live. Denver and others get stuck with the problems and cooperating with ICE makes it worse.",

Electric motors usually generate much more torque at 0 speed than an ICE which requires high rpms to produce sufficient power to overcome its own piston compression requirements (remember each piston is only producing power about 25% of the time, and that power stroke needs to power the remaining compression, injection and exhaust strokes) ergo an ICE engine tends to hit its peak torque towards its mid level revs and then needs a gearbox to convert those ~3000rpms into  1 rpm at the wheel. (Diesels tend to have a torque curve that continues to rise with rpms)  Whereas an electric motor generates instant torque at starting thus no need to reduce rpms to wheels, and the rotating magnetic field eventually brakes the amount of current into the stator magnets thus reducing the torque once the rotor is turning. But ultimately the stall torque load of most electric motors is still higher than peak torque in an ICE.",

Why would I not just close my business and lay of all my employees after I get to the point that I'm paying 39.6% on my income and then giving 45 % to the Feds after I die. Why libs think we should penalize people for being successful is beyond me, who else is going to pay your way?   And fair corporate taxes will help the middle class workers get raises, under the democrats wages have not went up much for 8 years. Also where were you the last 8 years when our nations debt doubled? Now you worried about it? 45% of the country doesn't pay federal income taxes and 70 % of the taxes are paid by the top 10% of course the top earners are the ones that will get more savings .",

Zocor and Lipitor (statins) caused a lot of grief (lots of unpleasant side effects) and the patient eventually got the cardiologist to agree to drop the statin.   Based on tests done later, it was clear the statin had likely been of negligible, if any, value, and the ACE inhibitor plus very low dose blood thinner had been doing the heavy lifting.   In the end, what started as a five drug regime was reduce to two.
