If Oahu can not care for the outer islands, it is long overdue for the outer islands to be granted the right, and share of state funds, to care for themselves.\n\nWe have seen this inequity played out time and time again.

Evergreens often germinate best on bare soil, after a fire, grazing or probably ash fall, spruce are naturally spreading at Dutch Harbor from trees the soldiers planted in WWII.\nWhat about Sugar Maples, great color for tourists and start a little industry for food independence, on formally bare rivers in SE Alaska sweet clover has taken over, another nitrogen fixer and honey producer.\nIf very careful about bringing honey bees to have a varroa free population they might be able to get involved in Queen production.

If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him.

Of course Putin was not for her.  \nWhat this is really all about is that the democrats knew for months that Trump was going to win, and that she was losing.  They knew the polls were rigged, it was all in the method section in each poll....over sampling democrats by up to 50%, etc.  More women than men.  Hardly any republicans, etc.  Even then, Trump would lead in many polls in certain areas.  So, the dems concocted this ridiculous story about the Russians to do two things:\n1.  cover their tracks for Hillary and Uranium 1\n2.  use this story to hurt Trump after the election.  They wanted to blame the Russians for her loss.  Only a fool would believe in this crap.",

Our Legislative Majority has treated medical Marijuana like that since it was voted on and approved many years ago. Oregon passed their medical bill at the same time as Alaska.

They also made it near impossible to get an MM card, and if you did, you were subject to a courtesy check to make sure you were in compliance with the law, which is vague at best. Very few Doctors were willing to stick their neck out to give you a MM card. It is still that way today. They are treating recreational about the same.

While in some countries a common slur might be \"hijo de puta\" or \"son of a whore\", in Peru it more commonly would be \"hijo de cura\" or \"son of a priest\", because that is the equivalent of \"bastard\" being that the biological father is forbidden from marrying his defacto common-law wife. But an honorable priest would be expected to adequately care for his \"wife\" and children, and this reality is tolerated because it is the people or community (sensus fiedelium) who not only support but at times require that a priest have an attachment.

Those holidays happen early enough in the school year that there is no way I wouldn't be able to make up the work, but since the teacher had scheduled a test for that day, with no way to make it up, I was out of luck as far as he was concerned.  Thankfully, my parents are both incredibly pushy and managed to make most of the problems go away without resorting to suing.\n\nAs for the Christmas songs, I would have been fine if they had been the secular Rudolph and Santa type songs, but not full on religious ones.",

At least be a man and use your real name. Keyboard coward.",

Lots of us have read Gramsci, and the writings of the Frankfort School, and, yes, Saul Alinsky; we understand the communist march through the institutions.   Into the 50s progressive was a synonym for communist, and a \"progressive person\" was a trusted fellow traveler but in a position where s/he couldn't be an open, card-carrying member of the Party.  Liberal became the substitute for use in polite company during the Cold War years until failed liberal policies made liberal a pejorative as well.   The government schools had done a good enough job of revising and air-brushing history that by the 90s it was felt safe to go back to the term progressive.   Some of us do know history and know that you've exposed yourself as either ignorant or a liar, but I'm confident you just think of yourself as \"educated.\"",

If this is a frequent event, maybe putting up a reward might help find the shooters, if that hasn't been tried. Putting signs along the major roads asking for information as well as mentioning this is a felony. It's damn sad that the family farmers really shouldn't have to put up with this crap. I can't do nothing to help but I sure feel a lot of concern and compassion for these people having another tough problem to face.",

Do not forget the US's role in the killing of Allende of Chile,  Mosaddaq of Iran and the millions who have died courtesy of US interventions in Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq and Indonesia to name a few. Mr. Rogan get your facts right. Nobody trusts the US. Sadly an empire in decline always has its former allies turn against it. Pakistan is merely following Machiavelli's principals of doing just enough to get the hegemon/ bully off its back. Don't expect Pakistan or any of your allies to do much more. Oh and don't bore us with stories of billions given to Pakistan. That is utter bullshit. They have paid of dictators and politicians with no benefit to the host country.",

I suppose to you, that when a woman accepts donations for her time, while having sex with you, she technically isn't a prostitute.\n\nNo matter what epiphany she had (proof I read the entire speech) later on, the fact that she referred to him as a separate kind, is clearly a sign of latent racism in the lefty playbook.

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola. My guess is that STASI contacted the Cubans and the Cubans conspired with Noriega to seize the freight. I wouldn't be surprised if Noriega then sold the cargo to the CIA.

It argues for allowing opinion, even on a hot topic.   (Especially on a hot topic, I'd say.)  \"Cultural appropriation: Why can't we debate it?\" she asks.  Well, the 253 comments before this one have been doing exactly that, so I guess that's her question answered.  But is anybody in this thread going to lose their job because of the views expressed here?  Not if their name is Retrofit, apparently.  So, why are people losing their jobs over this?  Because a smallish group of angry people disagree with their opinion?  Were Niedzvieki, Kay and Ladurantaye guilty of hate speech?  Is that why they lost their jobs?  No?  Then why did they lose their jobs over being part of a debate?  I support Renzetti's take on this.\n\nPart Two: The Thorny Question\n\nWhat do you think of Shakespeare's Richard III,  Orwell's 1984, and Twain's Huckleberry Finn?

Since 2000, the final salary  replacement ratio has on average been cut just about in half--and it is still falling. \n\nPast PERS recipients--especially those who retired circa 2000--got what everyone agrees was an outrageous deal. Current public employees have no chance of anything near that, yet people still use them as a target. The current anti-retirement measures and amendments in Ways and Means will damage some groups of public employees--and is causing panic among many nearing retirement--but they will yield almost nothing in savings. \n\nIt's time for the legislature to stop aiming at yieldless and diversionary targets and get serious about savings and revenue reform.",

There was a priest who ran an Institute for abuser outside Santa Fe and he bought himself an island, where he wanted to found a monastic center for abusers in the middle of the sea.

If the capital had not been needed for five years some might consider putting, as just one example,  $100k into guaranteed investments and $50k into relatively low risk dividend payers like your model portfolio and as they get closer to that house purchase date, shift more dollars into fixed income out of stocks. The amount in each is a personal decision. Whatever one does, they need to be comfortable with and fully aware of all possible outcomes.     \nAlso maximizing the use of a TFSA is ideal for type of situation. \nLastly, another investment possibility is a cashable GIC where the rate is guaranteed for one year but the GIC can be cashed either after 30 or 90 days depending on the institution.  \nSFI",

The Distributor also purchases a product produced in Ontario at a price of 100 and has to pay 13% HST on that product as well. The distributor sells both products for 150 and charges 13%HST. The distributor files monthly HST return where they remit the HST on the Sales and claim a rebate on the HST paid on the purchases.

As it turns out, the .50 AE is probably no better at penetrating flesh and bone than the now 61-year-old .44 Magnum.  It has everything to do with sectional density, the relationship of a bullet's diameter to its length.  Three hundred and even 350-grain .500-inch diameter bullets are relatively short and stubby especially compared to the projectiles used in rifle cartridges of the same approximate bullet diameter.  When you realize that 300-grain bullets are widely available in .44 Magnum loadings these days, it's no surprise that speaking of deer-size game, the .50 AE may benefit by punching a larger diameter entrance hole, but probably provides little, if any, greater penetration than the .44.\n\nBut returning to poor Ruiz, paper pages of small-book thickness can indeed stop some bullets.

A) the Author is a lawyer, not an economist, b) the Author worked for Reagan and is a Director of a couple GOP right wing policy Institutes, therefore expected to be a tad slanted in his opinion piece, C) this is an Opinion piece, D) he wrote his first critic of Obama economic policies in Feb of 2009, the month after Obama took office.  He quotes in the May 2011 Opinion extensively from his 2009 opinion piece. E) the article you have forwarded is from 2 years into the Obama administration, a period in time where we were very worried about a second Great Depression.  A Second Great depression caused by GOP policies of the Bush Jr. Administration.  I will repeat myself.  You cannot have guns and butter and tax breaks for the rich and famous, these are the failed policies of \"trickle down economics\" championed by the GOP since Reagan.  The GOP used to be a serious party, but not anymore.",

I also agree that whoever the writers of the Gospels were they were sincere in their conviction.  However, I should have said was false or incorrect news.  We have no original copies of the Gospels.  What we have were embellished, added to, with many copying mistakes.  13 encyclicals of Paul, 6 are considered as forgeries...forgeries are fake news.  We also know with certainty, and so does the church, that there was no historical Fall, thus no Original Sin.  Yet priests today giving a homily constantly refer to Adam and the fall from grace...that is fake news.  Another, and there are many, Jesus went to pray alone in the garden.  Yet we have His prayer that if possible the cup be passed from Him, that the Father's will be done, not Jesus.  The apostles were illiterate, no recordings, no witnesses wrote anything...this also has to be fake news. Worst; Gospels are Word of God...God wrote no book, nor did Jesus.",

This is no doubt a result of our strict adherence to the water restrictions. Furthermore the \"savings\" to us (and the cost to the city) has increased as restrictions have been become more severe during the year. This probably goes some way to explaining why the city has been so lax in enforcing the water restrictions imposed on households. They are trying to keep the city solvent. \n\nI would like to hear from Mayor de Lille & Ms Limberg just how far under budget they are in terms of revenue collections in respect of water and sewerage and what their plans are for dealing with this shortfall in the face of the rising costs of boreholes, desalination, flow meters",

It is not necessary for the population of Canada to grow. We have enough , and more than enough, people. We should be aiming for a policy that will stabilize the population immediately. I think that a slow (perhaps 0.1% per year) decline in the population would be optimum in the longer term.\n\nAs far as employment policy is concerned, the government should be trying to cause a labour shortage as a means to put upward pressure on wages. \n\nIn short, while I am entirely indifferent to the ethnic, racial or religious makeup of the immigrant population, I think there should be a LOT less of them.

While Saudi Arabia remains mired in a witch's  brew of pre-medieval  backwardness, the brave Iranian People have just strongly  reelected the moderate Rouhani, a victory for democracy which is the fruit of Obama's efforts.\nTHE question is, \"will the US reciprocate this positive sign with peaceful efforts of our own to help the Persian People free themselves from their own theocratic oligarchy?",

The reason all non-Canadians who enter Canada, whether legally or not, have these rights is because of a Supreme Court decision which found that the Canadian Bill of Rights applies to non-Canadians once they are in Canada (see link below).  A simple way to change this would be for Parliament to use the notwithstanding clause to temporarily suspend that Court decision.  If that were to happen, all those that cross illegally into Canada from the U.S. could be sent back to the U.S, pursuant to the Safe Third Country Agreement. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singh_v_Canada_(Minister_of_Employment_and_Immigration",

Thank you Robin for explaining in coherent detail why our current severance structure is fatally flawed and unconstitutional.\n\nFood for thought.  Big Oil is not run by fools.  It has figured out it is much, much, much more profitable to drill in Juneau than to explore and develop oil up North.  For several million dollars worth of lobbyists, PR and indirect methods for funding crooks, it transfers billions of dollars of oil wealth owned by Alaskans to London, and Houston. \n\nIf Alaskans can take our legislature back by continuing to fire Republican traitors- next on the list are Giessel and Coghill- we can reform our oil tax structure and avoid destroying the Alaska economy.\n\nFailing this- it is time to file a lawsuit and have the courts overturn the flagrantly unconstitutional theft of our oil.\n\nI hope Robin Brena can lead that effort- if needed.",

This team is long past its best by.  Accept what's staring you in the face, manage the fan base and do what you gotta do, don't leave me this way.....",

When the military develops something it almost always ends up a problem for citizens. They are responsible for our fascination with guns too. Thank God nobody that we know of is making nuclear weapons in their basement with instructions from the military.

Some zero population growth Greens actually take that position, but it is individual, not a requireed party plank. The right to abortion is part of a larger right to engage in conduct that the legislature has no business regulating in a free society. Not wanting a theocracy, even a Catholic one, is not a requirement of the faith. Sadly, Pelosi and Biden have done nothing to educate the hierarchy on why Roe says what it says.

The Knight Campus and a $50 million dollar unrestricted gift are historic achievements. Schill's response to the controversy over the naming of campus buildings was steady, thoughtful, fair, and inclusive--and it transformed a controversy into a public educational experience. He has the ability to see issues clearly, understand what is at stake, and design processes that will move matters forward.

And I don't mean his dollar contributions.  He didn't buy having a building named after him.  And the honor was given to him by those who had done the same. Deady Hall was built by a combination of tax money and voluntary donations from a whole bunch of (mostly) farmers who wanted to give their children and grandchildren a better education than they had themselves.  Many of those contributions were made in-kind, in the form of livestock or other products, sold for cash.\n\n Of course, Deady's views don't all jibe with ours today.  But the did comport with the views of his time.  When we dishonor him, we dishonor an entire generation.  It is the simple-minded hubris of the current day that demands we reject our own history. \n\nWe are not teenagers - who know far more than their parents.  Let's not act like we are.",

Economics is a particularly problematic case, partly because of the idea - propagated by neoclassical economists themselves since about 1900 - that it is like the sciences, when in many important ways it is not. That compounds all the concerns that would apply to scientific disciplines and creates many others.\n\nIn brief: peer review has its merits, but it is so crude as a basis for discerning the value of economic policy advice as to be almost useless except for the narrowest of questions.\n\nRegards,\nSean",

It is a naive vision which does not understand that repealing Roe means that the Court decisions on birth control, sodomy, gay marriage, Latino rights, and Catholic rights also become controlled by states, which cannot really be trusted with such matters to go beyond religiously led mob rule.",

They fluctuate year-to-year of course.  Looking only at January, those rates peaked in 2014 at 19.5 cents /kWh.\nRates aside, you need to compare apples with apples to see the big picture.  Look at the bottom line.  I care not what my rates are, I only care about the total monthly bill.\nFor example, we bought our home in 2009.  Our average monthly bill was $110 for the first 12 months.  Our highest in the period was $141 in the cold of February.  Today, our average monthly bill is $260, peaking at $295.

Singapore and Hong Kong were favorites then ( Japan was regarded as expensive), and China wan't even on the horizon. We were dropping like a rock in terms of median incomes by then, and government seems to have felt that trade agreements would help. They didn't, and it is a mystery as to why Canadians don't see that now, after all these years of declines. The problem isn't trade agreements - it is international trade itself. The faster that we lock the door and ban foreign items, the faster businesses will tool up here to supply them.

Canada is the second largest exporter of Natural Gas in the world and we get the lowest price possible, because the price is made up in the US. The US will object but they will pay the price because they have been rapping us for Natural Gas for ever and they will take years to redo their infrastructure. In the mean time the Canada Pension Plan together with Infrastructure Bank can kick off their first project, the construction of the LNG trains in BC, so all our gas can be sold on the international market at the international price.

The author presents the lunatic fringe on 4chan and voat as if they are Peterson's primary supporters, which he disavows. His supporters are mostly mainstream centrists including left-leaning liberals (like me), libertarians, and centrist conservatives. Even mainstream media has much support for him. Peterson supports transgenders and has support from them. The issue is compelled speech and fabricated pronouns like ze and zir, not transgendered he/she.\n\nThe article ignores his critics behaving badly, including calling his concerns as hate speech and shouting him down at McMaster, not to mention threats. Peterson is for liberal democracy and individual rights free from discrimination; his critics are largely radicals, treating people by traits, violating human rights",

Best practices will attract lower premiums, higher risk methods will incur higher premiums.\n\nIndividual sports will follow the same regime.  Lower ranked players will risk injury more. As rank rises, insurance penalties and health/injury penalties will become more compelling disincentives.    Lastly, promoters will likely share liability for injuries to their tournament entrants.

HART eventually acknowledged that this lawsuit increased rail costs by less than one-tenth of one percent ($6,321,002). The other lawsuit was brought in state court by Paulette Kaleikini because the City had started construction without first conducting an archaeological study, as is required by law.  A unanimous state Supreme Court ordered construction stopped until the City completed the study.  That took 13 months and, according to HART, cost $495,331 in litigation costs and another $39,039,250 in other “impacts.”  How can a unanimous Supreme Court victory be termed “frivolous?” .....",

Incidentally, religious rights do protect non-believers too or did you forget that non-belief was also once a heresy punishable by death.  Protection of religion is also protection from religion. It means, the state will not interfere in matters of faith. You seem to oppose this as you want the state to interfere in matters of faith so long as they interfere in ways that support your ideological point of view. What about when the state one day interferes in ways that conflict with your point of view? What then?",

Sadly, there is no evidence of that dynamic ever working in the long run. In fact, as an economist, Krugman should know that it is contrary to basic economic principles. When people are getting something for below market price or for free because others are paying the difference, they will tend to use more of it. As that happens, and since there are always limits to tax dollars and the political costs of deficit spending, rationing happens by various means. For Medicaid, it is doctors dropping out of that market, leaving those reliant on it with longer waits and lower quality doctors and care, even as our overall expenditures on Medicare go up. Even a Nobel prize winner can be wrong.",
