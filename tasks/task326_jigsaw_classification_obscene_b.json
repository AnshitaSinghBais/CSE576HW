However, dictatorship is a terrible idea and will be terrible no matter what kind of economy it has. Do you really think any of the tens of thousands of people Pinochet killed went to to their deaths thinking \"At least the brutal dictator who killed me is an almost libertarian capitalist and not one of those evil communists ones like Stalin\" ?\n\nDemocracy, when functional, actually naturally leads to socialism because government by the people will, inevitably, put the needs of the majority of people above the needs of a wealthy elite. America is a prime example of democratic theater with no actual democracy anymore. Democracy is what makes socialism work.",

I do know however, that your restriction doesn't have to do with other users choosing to flag your comments--even if a large number of your comments are flagged (for good reason or not), it is still up to a moderator in the end to decide what to do with them. In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you.

Suddenly he had a roster full of superstars and not enough money to pay them all with the new cap. The team slowly fell apart and conveniently Lacroix retires so that his \"genius\" reputation as a GM stayed in tact.  Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.  Remember that time when coach Q parted ways with the Avs and he went on to win several Stanley Cups with another team full of young talent? The front office sucks and Sakic is part of the problem.",

IMO, those \"grow some skin\" comments are a rather anemic attempt to avoid addressing the issues raised.  \n\nWhen it comes to passively accepting comments like Mr. Trump's nasty attacks on others w/o expressing my contempt for them, I will never \"grow some skin.\"",

I would suggest the natives start pulling their own damned boots on for a change, quit relying on the government and get resourceful. The reservations I have been around all offered a great deal of resources.  I'm not talking mining or drilling although those were generally present as well.  I would suggest hunting, fishing, hiking, tourism, even cultural history.  Nearly every reservation in the country is loaded with these resources and lets face it many of us would love to learn more about your culture and you.  Think about it!

Manuel Noriega on the other hand was also involved with the Cubans at that time (that was one of the reasons for his rift with the US-Americans, since he was also on the CIA payroll, but played a double-game). Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola. My guess is that STASI contacted the Cubans and the Cubans conspired with Noriega to seize the freight. I wouldn't be surprised if Noriega then sold the cargo to the CIA.

How are you to say what he should and shouldn't do? He could've shot once, I don't know his caliber of gun, but he did shoot way too much. who's to say what a humans reaction should and shouldn't be at that moment of fearing death or serious injury. \nI do understand it hurts to lose a dog, especially like this.",

The use of electrochemical storage in the form of batteries like the li-ion will likely be a component of the structure because they can rapidly store and release energy in an efficient manner.\nFuture grids will likely have large DC component because most storage works best with DC and even long distance high voltage transmission is more efficient with HVCD. There will likely be individual or microgrids, linked to minigrids that will link to the larger grid that at a national level will be able to deliver renewable power very efficiently. Large grid storage can efficiently use hydrogen and it will be the an important choice for long term storage although things like pumped water will always be cost effective as they have been. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_energy_storage_projects",

There was a $1.9B surplus in 2015-16, and the PBO said there would have been a $2.9B surplus in 2016-17 if Justin “the budget will balance itself” Trudeau hadn’t turned it into a $1B deficit.

HOWEVER on Oahu and most commuters on the neighbor islands, the 100 mile Leaf range for most Hawaii commuters is more than satisfactory for their daily commute & then change their Leaf at the end of the day.  This would not be true for most US mainland commuters who live in 'big' cities. Which is another reason why the Oahu heavy rail project is completely inappropriate (for another thread). In order for Nissan to stay in the EV car business they have to put out a 2nd gen Leaf with an over 200 mile rangle like the Bolt or Teslas soon.  Nissan engineers must be working overtime to release it by 2018 when the new Tesla come out.  Conclusion:  For Hawaii commuters saving an extra  $10K on a 100 mile range Leaf is a GOOD DEAL.",

There are supports available for immigrants and sometimes it takes them awhile to become productive contributors to the economy, but immigrants, overall, are a source of economic growth. More people working and buying things from each other makes for a more vibrant economy. I live in Toronto so I see all kinds of immigrants contributing to the economy. In Parkdale where a lot of them start out, there are all kinds of small businesses owned by recent immigrants. I bet they pay plenty of tax not to mention the sales tax they collect. \n\nIf people are calling you racist it's probably because you are.",

It's one thing to 'let it ride' in a retirement account hoping for modest retirement support.

As a farmer and engineer who has felt the loss of life in the tragedy of the runaway fire I think two things.

My thoughts: one, the fires were only indirectly related to the \"drought\", more to the ambient conditions at the time. There is also much more human interaction with flammable material in the area than ever before.  Humans flick out cigarette butts, light fires, live almost in the forest (some by choice, others seeking opportunity), need warmth, are careless (uneducated) and so on.\n\nSecond is that not too much seems to be being done about fire prevention and control. Aside from education, fire breaks are very limited and resources sparse. Commercial agriculture I am familiar with burns or cuts firebreaks every year and has (had) massive resources on standby during fire season.",

Can't do that with a train which by the way if there's ever an accident and it comes off the track, the train will be out of commission for days.

Sure you can make phone calls, work on your computer, and watch a movie on Rail, but unless you live 200 yards from the Rail station and your destination is within 200 yards, you will have to make a transfer to a bus possibly before and after being in the Rail car which adds to commute times.

Often the person He calls and empowers to do things is the last person we think should do the job. Number Two is that He absolutely loves doing things that are outside the limits we try to place around Him. I've seen Him do some pretty amazing things. A third is that He has a host of higher-priority things for us to do than argue endlessly in the defense of spiritual topics.

We should call on our government to radically reduce these numbers, especially in a time of soft economic outlook, soaring housing prices, and the strain on the social and physical infrastructures of our cities.

You are under the impression I was the one with the weak case who would have had difficulty winning an appeal.

I taught that course in an extremely even-handed manner and my other  Jewish students in that class were   were very supportive of me, which is why the head of Hillel on campus had requested Pipes drop his claims and apologize; it was only when Pipes refused this and similar  requests that I was forced to sue to clear my name.",

It would be regulated by the government, limiting their margins since they would not be taking risk and would require them to negotiate pricing with all providers so no matter who you choose as your provider your insurance will work. Since this would be done by a smaller number of companies they would have great bargaining power, but not monopolistic like the government behaves.

The dental fees for our family of 5 were at least 50% higher than what we paid in Ontario (after we moved to Alberta in the early 90's).\n2. If the author is implying that expenses are higher in Alberta and offsets the higher dental fees, then show it.  Expenses in a dental practice are simple, there is rent, hygienists, equipment, supplies, office support, and associates' fees.  You are a dental expert, so why are the costs so much higher in Alberta  It doesn't make sense especially when total dental expenses (excluding dentist salaries) should be no more than 60% of revenue.\n3. Profit reported to CRA is not credible once you factor in hygiene corps, management corps, trusts, and who knows what other tax vehicles.\nI can confirm Alberta dental fees are still out of hand today, quoted $1400/tooth for a gum work, got it done for $900 in TO.",

He hid it, showing it in rather humble ways, healing the blind, feeding multitudes, etc.  He just as easily could have shown His complete power and forced everyone to literally prostrate themselves before Him, but that would have been against His humble nature. \n\nNot sure which last paragraph you are referring to, but I stand by what I wrote.",

To say women's healthcare will suffer if PP federal funding in ended is false and fear mongering. At worst PP will reduce the # of clinics. CHCs are increasing every year.

The practice was further encouraged by the subsequent peoples who held the jews in slavery (more pregnancy = more slaves). Homosexuality was in the same banned catagory as masterbation and any other practices that did not result in a future child.

Sloter's showing great arm strength.  His stature is right there where many great QB's are.  Lynch is a bit too tall, and for whatever reason, tall QB's in the NFL don't do that great.  Sloter moves well and even has a weak side rollout where he can still huck the ball.  Lynch is very limited to the right side of the field.  Even if you wanted to run the options style, Lynch likely wouldn't last...he's already dinged up.  \n\nFrom the eye test, I just don't see what the draw to Lynch is, even when he played against the 2's.  So, what I see it as is more of a draft position thing.  I also think that the staff and Elway were so busy trying to get that #1 round draft pick up and running, and trying to start him, that they largely ignored Sloter and back-burnered him, expecting to at most put him on the practice squad.

Allowing equities to be taxed because of the dividend tax credit and 50% capital gains inclusion makes no sense at all. If you crunch the numbers, you'll pay more tax sheltering your interest bearing investments and allowing equities to be taxed. Why? Because interest bearing investments have very low returns. You should subject your lowest return investments to tax and shelter your highest return investments. That means bonds, GICs, etc in taxable accounts and 100% equities in your TFSA.\n\nAs far as the RRSP, it is untrue to say that withdrawals are subject to 100% taxation. A withdrawal could lead to no tax paid if the amount where small and there was no other income. It completely comes down to amounts and timing",

So I surmise that many heard that call as from God. If one was aware of gay desires, priesthood would be even more attractive because it embedded one on a community of committed men. I doubt if any gay person ever entered seminary with the prospect of abusing boys somewhere down the road. Which is why the percentages far outstripped the low percentage of gays in the population: one could just avoid temptation and count on supernatural grace. During seminary days that worked for the most part. But when stuck in lonely parishes with perhaps less congenial pastors and curates, priests began to look elsewhere. Gays to boys or men, straights to women. Nevertheless, the church does itself a disservice to pretend gays are few and identifiable, doubling down on its refusal to acknowledge sexuality as quite human for everybody. Pax.",

There have always been thoughtful people who questioned the bishops' position, but because the level of education in the general population has been so low until relatively recently,  the bishops could get away with it.  However, in areas where general educational levels have increased, there has been more rejection of that authoritarianism.  \nPeople can be very blind if they choose to be, and I believe that the hierarchy simply chooses not to see what is in front of their noses.  I think that the more that they hear that the flock disagrees and takes a different road, the more they dig in.  Some may give on superficial matters, but I think that over-all, they have chosen to define the \"faithful\" as those who agree with them and are willing to cast off the rest of us.  For an organization that claims that its goal is to lead all people to God, this is, for me, a rather odd stance.",

There is always a breaking point beyond which house prices are high enough that it makes more financial sense to rent.  $2500 on rent might be a waste if it costs $2500 a month to buy the same place and one plans on staying there in the long term, but it's rare in today's market that the rental cost would be anywhere close to the total costs of ownership of an equivalent property.

Suicide, physician assisted suicide, and a rejection of all pain are now growing in favor and acceptance. \n\nNatural death and illness are “realities” allowed by God, and so they ought to be sanctified, that is, made holy, with God’s grace and our trusting cooperation.  God gives us ways to do this (e.g., strength from the Sacraments, prayer, good spiritual direction).\n\nWhat is the purpose of our life and death: God's glory, through our union & deep intimacy with Him.  Death approached correctly can serve God’s will.\n\nHis will is: closer union with each of us, on His own terms, and our union with each of our loved ones.  He wills to use our life and death to help us grow in holiness until our last breath.",

Total AM rail commute: 95 minutes.  The deviation range is probably around -10 minutes to + 40 minutes.\n\nNearly all westside express buses take less than 1 hr to town.  Check OTA site.

I am deeply sorry to hear about your situation regarding your sister-in-law's visa.\nSadly, there are many families like yours who are unable to bring family members from other countries into the United States. Please know that personal stories like the one you shared with me is why I have been and continue to be a strong advocate for comprehensive immigration reform. I hope that during the upcoming session, Congress can work to find real solutions that would significantly reduce our current family visa backlog and make it easier to reunite families.\nThe backlog in family visas creates significant hardships for families. Although these cases cannot be solved legislatively one at a time, I am committed to working with my colleagues in the Senate so we can find a way to resolve this issue. I appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts with me.\nSincerely,\nBRIAN SCHATZ\nU.S. Senator",

In the case of the pills I have been given the standard script of about 24 pills and always had most of them to return to the pharmacy.  There wasn't a big discussion of pain relief with Surgery just a standard script which I think might be part of our problem.\n\nI understand everyone has a different tolerance for pain but why provide a weeks worth of pills when I am back to see the doctor in 2 days for a followup.  Also why is a narcotic the first line instead of a discussion about pain with the patient.",

Many of them are fighters. I am certain there are plenty of Russian intelligence officers there. Also, on 2 or 3 occasions Russian military did cross the border en mass, bailed out the separatists and promptly crossed back into Russia.

In recent code cycles, most earthquake structural design approaches have been unchanged.  Code changes continually tinker around the edges, but major changes are quite rare.\n\nMore importantly, our building department does a more thorough review of structural design than most places in the country, including California, Oregon, and Washington.

Of the Syrian refugees admitted to the U.S., half are children and only 2% are single men of combat age. This year the Obama administration wants to increase refugees to 10000. For a sense of proportion, there are 4.3 million U.N. registered Syrian refugees. \n\nSome politicians/pundits claim Obama wants to bring in 250,000 Syrian refugees. That number has no basis in fact. 85000 is the TOTAL number of REFUGEES from ALL parts of the world the U.S. will bring in this year, NOT THE NUMBER OF SYRIAN REFUGEES.  \n\nRefusing refugees from a religion comprising 1.5 billion is shear madness & also Un-American & plays into the hand of ISIS hate.

In order to be successful on trade the message must be \"things are good, but we can make them better and we will all be wealthier\".

I don't agree with the book 'Zealot' which has Jesus as an ordinary rebel in the civil strife of the times, with oppressed Jews fighting against Romans and their wealthy Jewish collaborators. Jesus seems more special than that. But it is important to know something of the mythology and the politics of the times to understand what may be factual in the New Testament.

Based on that, it seems likely there was public access up the South Fork in 1972. A park management plan published in 1980, but based on work beginning in 1977, also referred to numerous public access points in Eagle River Valley, including the one at the end of Hiland Road. Many of these trailheads needed parking areas or other amenities, but clearly they were being used in the late 1970s.\n\nMy point is that perhaps you misunderstood what the park officials were telling you.
