Well, let me address that by first rewriting your sentence so that it’s more precise…\n\n“There is a shortage of housing in Vancouver due to FOREIGN demand.”\n\nThe answer is simple: Shut. The. Damn.

I know you've been around long enough to have heard it before, it was the battle cry for starting Tebow when Studesville  took over as the interim coach following McDope's firing. Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him. If this were Lynch's first season with the team, I'd agree with your logic but I believe his leash will be shorter - especially since it is also tethering the new coaches and possibly higher.",

Suddenly he had a roster full of superstars and not enough money to pay them all with the new cap. The team slowly fell apart and conveniently Lacroix retires so that his \"genius\" reputation as a GM stayed in tact.  Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.  Remember that time when coach Q parted ways with the Avs and he went on to win several Stanley Cups with another team full of young talent? The front office sucks and Sakic is part of the problem.",

Looking at  grocery expenses only, that helps support the grocer, his employees, his landlord and the food processors or growers++ all of whom pay taxes to the governments, and their own living expenses, (generating more tax revenue).

I've had a look at your account, and to be quite honest I'm not sure of the reason for your restriction! I do know however, that your restriction doesn't have to do with other users choosing to flag your comments--even if a large number of your comments are flagged (for good reason or not), it is still up to a moderator in the end to decide what to do with them. In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you. However, the restriction should be lifted tomorrow, Jan. 14th!\nThanks,\nEmily",

Like management has the right to direct the workforce. Unions specifically don't have comanagement rights. Like how to clean toilets. What stands out in the article above is how the Hawaii public worker collective bargaining law rules out any negotiations on working conditions. A standard feature of pretty much all collective bargaining agreements. An example, AC in the schools. When you get to the heat levels in some of Hawaii classrooms it becomes a health and safety issue. Yet teachers could niether file a grievance, nor even negotiate it.

So white (particularly male) people have now to be apologetic of their \"privileged\" position in life?\nWith this type of reporting one should not be surprised that the \"white man\" feels threatened and that populist movements in Europe and USA will be further \non the rise. \n\nFirst of all there are numerous non-white role models in our society, like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, president Obama, or Malala Yousafzai. The fact that 12 year old children don't list these people has more to do with what they watch and read today. Don't forget \"Bollywood\" which is a bigger film industry then Hollywood and generates (non-white) role models for billions of people. \n\nCanada has provided non-white people opportunities which they would not always have had in their home countries. Canada is a great country because we welcome these people and allow them to pursue their dreams. However, we should not start creating divide between white and non-white people.",

He appeared in video in what looked like a football shirt which hardly identified him as a Catholic priest let alone a Dominican, I understand he no longer lives in the fraternal community.\nHe has turned an awful episode in the post-Conciliar Church into a media circus. Disapproval and condemnation of the abuse is one thing and is quite legitimate but he has not stopped there, he has gone public. He has blamed the institution itself for the scandal, the institution of the Church by Jesus Christ, Himself.\nWithout a doubt Satan has his fifth column in our midst.

I like Trevor and I like Paxton. I appreciate that you can understand Lynch still can develop. I just have to defend Paxton from all of these idiots who don't understand what development takes. He certainly hasn't exceeded expectation. But these people who think Trevor is head and shoulders above Paxton are delusional.  Where Lynch might throw an incompletion on a 3rd and 9, Siemian throws a check-down for three yards. And no, it doesn't \"give the receiver\" a chance.  We saw that last year.",

Fatalities involving an intoxicated driver are ten times greater (31%).  These data do not differentiate between hand-texting and hand-held or hands-free talking.

And if not, do you want to be part of an event where people mostly trying to do the right thing, and not even getting rich doing it, are treated this way. At the same time though, any sporting event involving money/animals/people will have cheaters. This does not, in my view, reflect negatively on the sponsors.

How hard is it to understand that victims of rape are severely traumatised and that going public with what happened, magnifies the trauma tenfold? One very good reason why rape victims don't go public is because of those who question their innocence and honesty and in doing so make their trauma worse!

According to HUD guidelines (people shouldn’t spend more than 30% of their income on housing) the average individual renter in Hawaii earns enough to afford about $700 a month on rent.  That’s enough to cover the cost to build a $300,000 unit.  The problem is that the average rental unit in Hawaii costs about $400,000 to build (averaged-out over all unit sizes).  So there’s a $100,000 per unit gap – which is why private developers have largely steered clear of building affordable rentals for the last 25 years.  So to meet the state goal we will need subsidies totaling $2.25 billion.  Sounds like a huge number.  But if we were to finance the investment through general obligation bonds at today’s rates and amortize the cost over 40 years -we assume the housing would last that long, right?- the cost would be about $100 million a year.",

I think we should send China a notice before we do anything: if you are not able to rein in your thug; we will do it for you. One thing I am sure is China will not start a war with us. Militarily, they are still way behind us and they know it. Another reason is that more than 50% of their top leaders' 2nd generation is living in the U.S. with their wealth.

The unitive aspect of sexuality in marriage is seen as equal to the procreative aspect only in the last hundred years. And yes, we are still learning scientifically. Some advocate that learned truth can change old guidelines; others insist the old guidelines are by definition perfect. Our history shows that our perfection is overblown, and that we learn and grow as described above.\n\nTo answer your last question: I have read the passage and I believe its message, but your interpretation of its message doesn't reflect the love that Jesus offered and offers.",

So we gave an offer for the 920k (not going to mention what offer we gave but definitely close to 1 mill) where we realized their expectations were to 1.2k. Then why the heck did they list it for 929k and invite in people for showing and play mind games? Wasting the buyers’ times and the relators’! Now he has changed the price to 1.3k again and relisted it - the fourth time. And I so agree that this article is for sellers as such! I am not saying that one should under value their property. But they should stop playing mind games or to try encouraging the bidding wars between the buyers by lowering the price. Lets put some fairness in perspective please.",

Kaepernick pledged last year to donate through his foundation, $10,000 a month to causes which help poor and oppressed people; the amount has now reached $900,000.   The $25,000 was donated to 'Assata's Daughters' named for Shakur.

If all of the cars on the road were autonomous, traffic would move along quite nicely because cars would be able to automatically merge onto and off of the freeway with very little slowdowns since it would be done in an orderly and efficient manner and at close to speed limit depending on volume.  Any stalled cars would automatically have cars behind them automatically merge into other lanes with very minor slowdowns to get around the stalled cars.  This will all happen in the next 10-20 years and due to mass production efficiencies, these innovations will appear on all car types (not just luxury cars).",

He was met with the GOP stated goals of (a) making him a one-term President, and (b) the GOP plan to never vote for any legislation Obama proposed without tearing it apart.  That is what they did with his ACA - what we got was not what he proposed.  While I agree that the handling of the bankers and Wall Street exec's was more than lacking, remember that those very people who caused the Great Recession were protected by powerful Republicans (and a few Democrats) in Congress.  So, this essay deserves to be placed in the waste can as lacking truth or depth.  When will MSW learn?

Canadian banks typically return 12-15% annually so that would be 7-9% after tax.  Both of these would double the appreciation on a primary residence, meaning that over 25-30 years of compounding, the home owner loses big time.

Same revenue, less cost, there is a surplus. \n\nSo clearly the country is better off with a reduced work force. \n\nIt has taken about 60 years to get to our current perception that if you are not in the work force, you are nobody. And that is with business pushing and the media publishing articles like this. \n \nWe need  low income inequality. The country gains. But that is another story (by Wilkinson and Pickett)",

You were wrong to argue for the raid on the Fund the last time it was tried with Gov. Murkowski.  That raid was not necessary, it would have hurt working Alaskans and our economy.\n\nTaking thousands of dollars away from working families and poor Alaskans means they will have less money to spend in the Alaska economy.   This will lead to a decline in the Alaska population as some people will no longer be able to afford to live here.  Things are already bad for Alaskans having to pay for the most expensive health insurance in the USA.\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE LOW OIL PRICES.  $9.3 billion dollars of oil is taken from Alaska, tax free, per year.

If you think Indian status is complicated on mainland Canada, it is more so on the Island of Newfoundland. When NL joined Canada it was supposed Island Mi'kmaq would fall under the Indian Act. Turns out the feds were already planning to wean Canada's aboriginals off government subsidies and so St. Laurent denied federal responsibility. NL had neither the wherewithal nor inclination to fill in for the feds and so NL's innu languished in no-man's land for decades. The province was also convinced its Mi'kmaq were not aboriginal, at least not to NL - that their arrival post-dated the European presence there (and hence with no stronger land claim than any other settler). The criteria for Qalipu status is more narrow than the national model; they must have a current and substantial connection to native communities on the Island. And that, it turns out, accounts for the vast majority of the rejections. \n\nClear as mud?",

With globalization now, there are no \"natives\" but instead the less rich (locals) vs. the very rich (migrants).  Hawaii (ironically proudly) led the U.S. in expanding govt welfare and entitlements to fill its widening classes gap due to the disappearing middle class (the locals).  Viola, Hawaii's political answer has been to increase State GDP via untethered tourism and construction (as distinguished from military spending).

But what will change is our potential response to the inevitable.\n\nThe Accords REQUIRE every person of a member country submit to provisions of the document, which for the US meant an economy-killing rollback of the use of fossil fuels with no VIABLE replacement energy. How does a country crippled by its own stupidity respond to a natural cycle that requires adaption because control is impossible? Had we stayed with the Accords, developing nations would have used US funding to adapt while we would have been starving in the dark and cold.
