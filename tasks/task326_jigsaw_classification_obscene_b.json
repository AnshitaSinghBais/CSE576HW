He posits this as though it occurred in an historical vacuum, which it did not. Reaction against the consistent ethic of life occurred against the backdrop of attempts by the Catholic left to respond to Roe, & resulted in an attempt to co-opt elements of Catholic social teaching for alignment with another political party. I have no disagreement with what you, Cupich or Francis, says about the primacy of abortion, the need for respect, etc. Instead, I am only trying to assert a one-sided narrative that I think Winters engages in here.

At the same time, we must consider that the culture of that place and time was far different than today.

They should not get full benefit after 35 years to the CPP portion of their pension, while others have to contribute 40 years for the same benefit.

This kind of feigning that one doesn't know one's own language never ends.  The demands never end.  A slight will be found someplace else.

Then the RTD shut the bus down in preparation for forcing us all onto the \"A\" train. To use the \"A\" train I need to get myself three miles to a light rail station. There is a bus a few blocks away I can catch if I lug my bags over there. Hopefully not in the rain or snow. Then I take the light rail downtown, where I get to drag my bags half a mile to the \"A\" train. Which may or may not be running, depending on what breaks down that day. To be sure I get to the airport on time I need to leave my house at least four hours before flight time. Thanks, but no thanks. Bring back the SkyRide buses!",

Under current law, if your parent dies and leaves you the long time family home  and you sell it, your basis in the home is the value of it on the day they died, rather than what they bought it for.  This means that you will not show a gain from the sale and will have no taxable income from it. If Trump sticks to his plan to get rid of the ability to step up the basis, then when you sell the home that your parents bought a couple decades ago, you will likely show a significant taxable gain. Of course, Trump has also talked about getting rid of the capital gains tax at every income level, so in that case no one pays anything... This is something to watch as they reshape the tax code, as for many the only real asset they have is their home and it could be a downward shift in taxes.",

Unfortunately the link to the RMIT university page (which did work) indicated that \"the page could not be found\". I will follow up on Google.\n Many key points triggered reactions with me. The \"learning curve\" being one. As you are probably well aware from the reports of the various Judicial Reviews here in Ireland; the repeated phrase of many bishops & superiors; was that they had no awareness; it was all new to them; they had no training; they were never prepared for such scandal; nobody told them etc. These were the men with PhDs in various disciplines. The best and the brightest, that got the tap on the shoulder. They were the \"good shepherds\", who would look after \"their flocks\". Good shepherds would not leave their flocks vulnerable to predators.\n \"Lies; lies and damn lies\" . \nYour synopsis is very revealing and opens up another path to understanding this critical failure by the institutional church.

Trudeau's only accomplishments to date, like sort of getting along with Trump and a relatively robust but still fragile economy, have been achieved by default. But big minefields exist for the Libs on immigration, NAFTA and aboriginal affairs. On the latter issue, I suspect most Canadians have little interest in the models of aboriginal sovereignty proposed by many First Nations advocates. It will be almost impossible for Trudeau to achieve his vaunted new relationship with First Nations and keep the remaining 96% of Canadians mollified. And his broader predilection for identity pandering increasingly irritates many Canadians. The risks ahead are all Trudeau's to face.",

Pence who said the magic word for the evangelical voter: \"sanctity of life\" and \"pro-life.\"  Frankly, I don't care about an elected official's moral dilemma as what matters is how they govern.  How and where they worship (or not) is of little importance in this matter.  My general conclusions about the VP debate is that it matters none, no one changed their vote as a result, the undecided will remain undecided until they are in the voting booth, and the divisions were set long ago.  Barring any catastrophic events, and I am not certain there won't be one of some  sort, what will happen in a month from now is pretty well established.

Clearly, the doctors were going to be on the losing end of this bargain as insurance companies were required to cover more people for more things for less money, and we all know how willing insurance companies are to operate at a loss. The result has been insurance companies dropping out of the ACA market, leaving some areas with as few as one provider (i.e. a monopoly), and doctors dropping out of the market because of low reimbursement rates.\n\nDo we get it now?\n\nIt is time to repeal and replace this mess caused by Obama and the Democrats.

It follows that the north does not participate in the reported economic growth of BC.\n\n2. The north is languishing and this highlights for residents there the hollowness of the BC Liberal promise of LNG development induced prosperity.\n\n3. The political question will be therefore whether northerners turn to the NDP because of BC Liberal failures or, conversely, they turn to the Liberals because the NDP is viewed as putting job growth at risk because of their emphasis on environment protection.\n\nPolling currently suggests that the Liberals are the preferred if reluctant choice of northerners but this could change.",

Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.

I have a subsistence halibut permit - a permit type which is actually overly-generous and prone to abuse, I fear - but I can't pass it on, sell it, or even give it away. It doesn't cost anything and expires every two years. Fine.\n\nWhy don't we give perpetual, salable guiding rights to big game guides in wildlife refuges? Or perpetual, salable national forest cutting rights to timber companies? Or perpetual, salable vending rights to companies in national parks?

I'd not ask it to reject Jesus, should society ever go through such a phase.  But at the same time, so many of the church's positions have rather clearly been categorically rejected by the laity, that the church's ongoing formal position becomes a matter of obstinacy.  Such a situation needs to be met head on: a dialog of sorts between church leaders and the people they serve.  If such a dialog cannot lead to an agreement, then I think the laity should prevail.\n\nAs to the definition of abuse/evil, I think you're missing a bit one (inferred, but not stated).\n\nWhen the organization finds itself selling out individuals (ESPECIALLY the weak/vulnerable) so as to protect others, alarm bells should ring.\n\nThanks for the post: well done.",

To be \"progressive\" means that one thinks the state should have authority over every aspect of a society's culture and over every aspect of the individual's life.  Also, Progressivism is de facto socialist. Progressives also promote the so-called pro-choice position respecting abortion. These same support gay marriage,  and take other positions of morality inimical to the Catholic Faith. \n\nBut for lack of space in which to write, I could mention other ways that Progressivism is contrary to the faith.

Nope.  \n\nWe can't find growers because they make more $$ selling to the shops.  \n\nWe have no idea if pesticides were used.  For the same amount of meds for $90. is now costing around $250=300.

Something will bite Trump in the ass and result in something hurting the US on an international level, and result in fallout on the international level. Take your pick what this is? NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3. Something that trump does in the US will cause a cascade effect at home. I can't claim to know what that would be, because its far too early in his presidency.

St Paul's are based on something much higher ... we humans, after all, are something much more than mere biological machines. We are in the Imago Dei ... whether biologically male or female or intersex, whether straight or gay or any shade in between.\n\nAnd the higher good is the flourishing both of individual humans and of the collective.

What a sorry debacle this was and what a huge embarrassment for United Airlines whose motto is 'Fly the friendly skies'. But not so friendly on the ground. Initially the president, Oscar Munoz did not seem to see anything wrong with the way it was handled.  He has now apoloogized for the incident. Too little too late Oscar.  The right thing for you to do now is to resign and let somebody take over who knows how to manage an airline. I wonder if you have the intestinal fortitude to do the right thing?

Replacing some of the environmental assessments axed by Harper had to occur too - the federal government was simply doing what it is supposed to do and let the NEB do its work. This project was killed by financials as there simply isn't enough benefit to outway risks with current oil prices.

Keystone XL might be dead too if prices stay low - is that the Liberals' fault too?!",

But with increasing workplace penetration, machine learning and algorithms will start improving exponentially, and eventually supplant more and more people.  I could see very significant impacts on employment and society within the next 15-20 years.  Is it reasonable to think that new jobs and professions will sprout to replace the old ones?  Maybe, but many (most) will remain under or unemployed. What will people do without meaningful work?  How will they pay for food and rent?

But they kept Weinandy around for a long time when it suited them to look like JPII/BXVI henchmen.  Now, they need to change tactics and look more like Francis.  Have they really changed who they are?  Is there any depth to them?\n\nWhat is ironic, too, is Weinandy complaining about the Pope refusing to dialogue with him and talk to him when that is exactly what he did in his \"judging\" other theologians, like Eliz. Johnson.  Why does he complain when he is treated as he treated others?",

It's a egregious constitutional violation which, essentially, deprives citizens of the initiative right.  The initiative process was designed and placed in the US and Oregon Constitutions specifically to provide citizens a direct \"recourse for grievances\" vis a vis an over-reaching and controlling legislative body.  The Board's assumption of a preemptive veto power to keep initiatives off the ballot negates that constitutionally protected citizens' power.  IMO, a Board truly dedicated to democracy would not even want such power, let alone try to grant it to themselves.  regards, Gary",

Almost 100 people are employed.  5 employees might actually be eligible for a PFD.  The rest are from out of state. Again the state is paying 65%.  If the oil rig hits oil, the state will get back 12.5% royalty and zero production tax after paying full cost to lift and transport.   Pay 65% up front, get back 12.5% on the back end.  If the rig hits gas, the state will get 17 cents per mbu.  Enstar just signed a five year contract to pay $7.52 per mbu.  On the North Slope, the state taxes on the net profit and rebates those taxes as a percentage of the gross price.  This virtually ensures that the remaining 3.5 billion barrels of easy lift oil will be sold for next to nothing in production taxes.  \"Asinine\"!",

Whatever justification for it there may have been before obviously no longer exists given the reckless behaviour of Ukraineâs ruling kleptocrat. Defence Minister Sajjanâs sabre-rattling against Russia was grossly irresponsible when a tough love approach to the Ukrainian government was surely what was called for.

The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks.

The need then is to examine whether the supply being built meets shelter demand (would require legislation/ incentives to drive building of units with more bedrooms), as well as to assess whether this \"demand\" is being driven by demand for something other than demand for shelter (which has a lot less to do with population growth than it does with speculation [either foreign or domestic]).\n\nIt's worth noting that the population growth rate in the Lower Mainland was larger 10-20 years ago, when prices were relatively flat. And that rents here, even with recent increases, are less than the carrying costs for owning (very true for detached houses). This does not suggest demand for shelter.",

I also remember the City officials intentionally awarding contracts to start the project before receiving Federal government approval and when they got caught and had to stop the work, they claimed the contracts were awarded prematurely to convince the public that the rail project was progressing as planned. Look where we are now â a 20-mile route, half completed for $8 billion and several billion more needed to get it to Ala Moana Center.  Despite this, no one has been held accountable.  Instead of more money to complete the rail project, we need a Federal investigation under RICO statutes for the rampant corruption called HART.   Lock them up.",

Please, please, please -- in the upcoming three years, write at least a yearly follow-up article. Anyone with sufficient will-power can hang in for six months -- that's not the test.

The nearest âlargeâ town is Island Pond, 16 miles south.  Its population was 821 in 2010, but it does have a few shops that serves people living in the surrounding wilderness.  It is a beautiful area, hilly and wooded with many streams and lakes.   Great place for hunting and fishing.  Summers are short and cool summers; winters are long, cold and miserable.   My wife and I wondered why anyone would want to work there except perhaps hard-core locals.  Customs and Border Protection apparently is wondering the same thing.",

Or if I could make more in the summer then I could buy boilers and other high dollar high stress failure items and store them for a rainy day.\n\nI mean do you want your land lord in your place tearing up the kitchen to put in new floor etc etc?\n\nThe reason land lords charge so much is the purchase price of the units.

We can be reasonably certain of that based upon history and science alone, barring some cataclysmic event such as a Yellowstone eruption or nuclear war or asteroid impact.\n\nWhat is often ignored in the climate change debate are the costs of government policies, particularly opportunity costs, and only a vague declaration of the possible benefits (without evidence).

That was proven when, after a few day, Comey closed the investigation again.

He could have done so quietly, and then revealed any pertinent evidence if it were discovered. Instead, he very publicly re-opened the investigation... and then closed it again when nothing turned up.

It was a tough life, but people came for religious and civil freedom and a new start, to get away from religious persecution and the aristocratic levels of society that restricted them from higher occupations.\n\nThis is not the case at all today. Many people from poorer countries would love to come to the more developed nations, not necessarily for religious and civil freedom, but for money and prosperity. And since there are welfare and medical systems in place, the cost of an immigrant to the nation is much higher than in the days of the Revolution.

MyCiti is based on cities like Curitiba, except those examples could not easily be applied to SA's apartheid-era spatially inefficient, decentralised urban planning, which added to MyCiti's cost (long distances). \nThe selling point for these systems is they're 'rapid' - buses in dedicated lanes are not going to get stuck in traffic like other motorists, so people would want to use them, and it's cheaper than private car (fuel, wear & tear, long travelling times on congested roads).  Note other cities w/ functioning, efficient mass bus systems like London and Rome don't use dedicated lanes except here and there. So there's your billions, not overpriced tenders.\nBTW Cape Town has increased street 2017 parking rates by almost 60% to about R17/hr, above private rates!",

This (to me) is the most obvious error which religious devotees make - they already have \"god is the answer\" ... no matter what the question is. \n\nDiscoveries about the human brain (and don't forget all the other critters too) are coming fast and often. We will learn so much more about what really goes on during meditation as future years unfold. And we will learn (I believe) that animals have much greater capacities than we currently realize. \n\nFurther, I believe that the direction of humankind will greatly improve once more humans learn how their \"obvious answers\" are not really that clear.

The PERS unfunded mandate is a creation of public employERS taking the \"short, easy way out\" and not funding the \"PERS-pick-up\" as it was due.  Instead they delayed payment of those funds until retirement.  Consequently, that \"unfunded mandate\" grew each year for each employee.  Had those public employers paid the PERS pick-up each month along with the \"employer contribution\", there would be virtually NO unfunded mandate.  Folks shouldn't blame the public employees.  It was the legislature, school boards, city and county governments, et al who chose to NOT pay the contribution as it was \"credited\" to employee retirement accounts.... This, as we're seeing today, was a MASSIVE mistake. Gary Crum",

Cause, you know, he was being a dick.\n\nOutraged by this, Columbus consulted his shipboard almanac to ask if there was anything he could use to trick the natives. As it happens, there was a lunar eclipse coming up. On the 29th feb, the day of the eclipse, he gathered the natives and told them that god was angry for their disrespect and would take away the sun. Disappearing inside his ship during the eclipse, he waited as the good people begged for their women and children.

His father died 3 months short of liberation. No one has depicted the Holocaust as well as Eli in his many books and in his \"Dialogues\". His own sufferings and his thoughts on forgiveness have helped many a survivor deal with their own. At risk of being repetitive, from his Dialogues, I cite the following...\"No one should place the burden of forgiveness on the victims\".  When the above sermon comes up year after year along with its self righteous comments, it does just that. Still, for Eli, being forgotten added to his constant misery of dealing with forgiveness. Already, new generations of American Catholics are clueless about the Holocaust and are encouraged to not be too curious about the pedophilia crisis. Christ said \"Remember Me\".

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: \"With Grave Concern\" (respectful thanks to Pius XI).",

The FBI, CIA, NSA and several Congressional committees were not able to find a shred of evidence of collusion, so the mission was assigned to Mueller to find it.  He has been at it since March and has not found or produced any evidence.  He has instead turned his focus on other things people connected to the Trump campaign might have done wrong and that is what we now are see.   Manafort and Gates were indicted for alleged crimes unrelated to the Trump Campaign.  Papadopoulos got nailed for lying about something that was not illegal.  Stupid.   If more indictments come against former Trump Campaign people, they will be similar to Papadopoulos - lying or misleading investigators about something that was not illegal, like meeting with Russians.

We shouldn't be in the position of \"submitting,\" but it happens all the time.   I know there are perfectly sweet-hearted people who have no idea that their well-meant gesture might be an imposition --- or, who knows? the gesture could be completely welcomed --- but it seems the safer thing is not to extend a hand unless you have good reason to think it will be accepted.  Where I went to Mass this morning --- we chant the Agnus Dei, the Credo and the Gloria --- no one held hands.  If I'd missed that Mass and had to go to another parish later this evening, I'd have to expect someone reaching for me.  They'd have a reason to assume it was OK with me.  But thus illustrates a good point.  We used to be one; now we're splintered.  Whether to hold hands is a rather minor thing, but it exemplifies deeper divisions.  That's not good.",

If they are, it's hard to imagine their agreeing to sit on such a \"team\" and to engage in the implicit intimidation and threat involved. This kind of intimidation often wears an informal bureaucratic face. That's part of what makes it so unsettling.

In Windward and all up the coast to Turtle Bay, the Homeless population has been growing exponentially- but Serves & Social Workers are sorely lacking. \nIn peaceful Kaneohe you now regularly see new mentally ill homeless. In rural Kahalu'u & Ko'olau Loa there are many more new homeless living in the wooded areas, parks, in their vehicles. Spending our tax money to push people from one area to another is Not a solution !   In addition,  up our Windward-North Shore coast we have a growing population of  Local Working Homeless. Illegal Vacation Rentals are booming in coastal areas, forcing rents up ! We now have local security guards, janitors, home aids, food prep workers and their families living in tents, in cars & on couches.     We need Serves, Social Workers, Drug Treatment, Real Enforcement of Illegal Vacation Rentals, Our Worklinks Job Training restored in Hauula & Kaneohe. People who Care !",
