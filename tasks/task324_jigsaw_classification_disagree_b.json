The bias comes in public media’s skilled use of inclusion and exclusion; they did not have a single show lamenting civilian death during eight years of Obama Administration Middle East bombing.

We are told that those who stand by Israel will be blessed by God.  Put another way---our standing with Israel is the best insurance policy America has . As long as God is with America , we will be blessed and survive.  You may or may not believe in God----but those in power do. They don't want to offend others so they keep this belief to themselves , and work behind the scenes to make sure we protect Israel.  So far this has worked . The day we turn on Israel , as Obama was starting to do , we will no longer be blessed by God.   As for the issue of abortions , there is zero doubt this is wrong in God's eyes. Each person will have to answer to God for their participation in that. Abortion issues is still not reason enough to cancel our insurance policy with God.",

However men from across the globe do bring a font of understanding premised on lived experience in parts of the world not truly experienced by the church's center, the Holy See.\n- As to the selection of the next archbishop of Rome; let us recall that Pius xi started out as someone who was open to adapting to the steady change in Europe occurring in those days. Then he discovered that it meant that he would not be universally loved and then he essentially retreated into a fortress Church of his own creation which maintained a siege mentality until Vatican II.",

I understand that government charges in the GTA add about 30% to the cost of a new home.  These costs don't include HST on building materials and independent contractor fees and provincial and municipal land transfer taxes .  The \"solutions\" introduced by the Wynne government will fail as they simply don't address the real problem which is the lack of supply caused by both provincial and municipal government policies.

That ranger wrote in his Criminal Incident Report that he thought the damage was caused by a human, not a bear, because someone had used an ax to try and beat holes into the metal roof of the cabin. He regrets that he did not continue walking 5 miles furthur to the bus where Chris was starving. Several days later two more Park Service employees flew into the cabins to assess the damage. Had the helicopter continued five miles down the river to the bus the rangers probably would have found and rescued McCandless who was at that time starving and seeking help. Chris may have heard the helicopter but apparently didn't have a signal fire ready to ignite. Perhaps because he feared a rescue by Park \"officials\".",

Thus one could expect to pay more than people in other countries.\n\nWith health care in the private sector, those who cannot pay enough will need support.

New England often has drafted lower than the Broncos, yet seem to come up with more players who are able to contribute earlier than similar Bronco draft choices. Also, in this regard, I can't help but think that the Scouting the Patriots do for possible draft choices is better (more detailed, more in depth, etc.) than what the Broncos scouts look for.

I don't think the argument here is that academics have to shut up in more popular fora (This author himself is writing an op-ed!), but rather that universities need to recognize what type of public engagement they want to encourage.

If universities start favouring clicks over rigor they will quickly erode the very prestige upon which they trade.\nIf an academic wants to engage in silly jokes and lazy stereotypes on their own time, they can do so as citizens. But they shouldn't present that as 'expertise'. McGill should never have gotten involved in disciplining Potter, but he also embarrassed himself and brought disrepute to his institution.",

Low current and low voltage with 12V or 24V which the whole automotive/RV world operates on.\nWe have DC minigrids now that are in things like sever stations that operate at 380 VDC.  A lot of saving not doing AC to DC conversions both in terms of electrical efficiency and heat n the case of server stations.

Obama's stimulus spending added $787 Billion and included extensions to unemployment compensation and some tax cuts, Obama's increase in military spending added $800 Billion per year. All of Obama's programs added a modest total of $983 Billion to the national debt during his two terms-- he might have spent more but was blocked by Congress and budget sequestration. So biggest increases in the deficit come from tax cuts by Bush and Obama. Ben Stein a strong Trump supporter is one of several Republicans who oppose further tax cuts, but Republican tax policy is usually just tax cuts which add to the debt.",

Your sources prove me correct -- ACORN was the victim of registration fraud by some of the workers it hired, who were paid by the card. Some took advantage in order to cheat ACORN out of more pay; ACORN however is legally obligated to turn all cards in (it's illegal to destroy any of them), ACORN self-reported the auspicious ones so they'd be checked out by the county clerks. That's how the system is supposed to work. The same registration fraud you blame on ACORN also was committee by Republican led registration drives.

He may be a slow learner. Give him chance to learn the system and figure out how he can adapt his game to the new offense. \n\nThere is no way to tell just how well either QB will perform this year.

And then there is a wide variety of anecdotal information on tax hits on forums such as this, but no details are ever supplied.  The Globe ran a rather exhaustive analysis on a number of scenarios, and again, no significant impact on most earners.  The only ones impacted seem to be very high earners who are using a corporate structure purely to save on tax.  And that's not wrong, but there is a rule that Revenue Canada can reverse any strategy which is purely to save tax.  So I'm just trying to figure out what the actual problem is.  No one seems able to say it in the simple form of - \"this rule means that for this income this much extra tax will be paid\" - and then explain why that is unfair.",

I see his refusals as a deliberate attempt to make himself into a martyr. He knew full well the plane wasn't going to leave with him on it and yet he kept refusing to leave, forcing United to physically remove him (and boy did he scream and wail for that, notably). This is why the man's criminal history is relevant. I see this as a case of United being a bit unfair to a customer, who happened to be an opportunistic fraudster.",

The Eastern Orthodox Churches permit their liturgies in the vernacular language right beside their traditional liturgies in Ancient Greek and Old Church Slavonic; Vatican II did not follow this route and that's why there has been so much friction. The Eastern Orthodox never had these liturgical divisions because they handled everything much more wisely.\n\n2.  Changes in the Catholic liturgy required a smart pope who knew how to introduce a more modern liturgy right beside the Tridentine Mass.  Sadly, Pope St. John XXIII and Pope Paul VI lacked this insight; Benedict XVI did not; what was a valid Mass for four centuries (the Tridentine Mass) is still valid today.\n\n3.  EWTN is the most powerful Catholic news outlet on this planet (with 250 million viewers), and it is controlled by laypeople as Mother Angelica intended, so that the hierarchy has no power over it.   \n\n4.

Well let's take the only metric most people care about: jobs, because that's how they feed their families. \nWhen Thatcher was elected the UK had roughly 1.5 million unemployed (only counting people of sufficient health to work and of working age).\nAfter 2 years that number rose to 6.5 million - the highest it has ever been before or since. She then scaled back some policies - and finally when she left office it was at 4.5 million. Still 3 million more than when she started.\n\nYeah... great job that !",

If a person truly has a homosexual orientation is it moral or ethical to expect that they should never have a loving intimate relationship with another human being? I don't think so, and it seems that more and more thinking & moral people are coming to this conclusion. The Church has not yet synchronized morality with normative human behavior as we have come to understand it through modern science and psychology.

The military-industrial complex, Intelligence services, and US political establishment in general (and its media echo-chamber) have a vested interest in maintaining hostilities between US and Russia. That's how they justify their bloated budgets, their military bases and their warmongering. They've just got to have an enemy even if one doesn't really exist.",

As long as we tax property, without regard to means, based on how much someone else would pay for it whether the owner wants to sell it or not, rising property taxes will always render all property less and less affordable through time. This is a kind of economic cleansing. In Boulder, we have the paradox of the few low income persons who have managed to hold onto a residence subject to escalating taxes in part to support programs intended to provide affordable housing for people who actually have higher incomes than they do. An enlightened property tax system would consider means and freeze property-related taxes on the sole primary residence of persons of limited means until such property is sold or transferred.

It's also clear that apart from a quote in the next day's Juneau Empire, we don't know precisely what she said. The act and her role in its passage essentially disappeared from the public record for nearly three decades. It was so forgotten that when Elizabeth died in 1958, the obituary that appeared in the ANB's own newsletter made no mention of the act or her supposedly famous speech. The first account is a remembrance by Gruening twenty-nine years later. The rest of her speech was embellished by later writers. My goal is not to chip away at Elizabeth's legacy, only that we should be honest with ourselves about what we know and what we don't.

The government would be foolish to make any changes that you allude to in your post. First, the number of available rentals would likely decrease significantly, since roughly three times as many condo buildings as opposed to apartment buildings have been built over the past decade. Further, if these units are removed from the rental market, then the rental prices will increase (i.e., supply is less than demand).

You can always go to trial and the jury/judge goes for the lesser included offense and they are convicted of criminally negligent homicide instead of manslaughter.  10 year felony or 5 year felony and the probable sentence in 3 years",

When they pay out claims they are not as profitable . Medicare Part D allows the Drug companies to manipulate the pay out to increase their profit margin by increasing the cost of medications as much as they like. Doctors charge more because they are charged more to learn to be Doctors . Hospitals charge more because they can monopolize the system. The people end up paying 10 times as much for third rate , and predatory Health Care. Single payer option is without doubt far superior to our current \" for profit \" system in providing quality care at a fraction of the cost to the patient. Profit should NOT be the determining factor in providing Health Care to the taxpayers , and working people that are the engine of America's economy .

I can't see a pathway that will get us thriving intercity rail.  Maybe the best option is to design bus trains having multiple linked sections and train like accommodations that run on the interstates and connect directly to mass transit sites in the cities they serve.  Alternatively, nationalize all the nations tracks (not the rail companies) so as to maintain and deploy them in the public interest (like the interstates).

Public schools are neglected, hospitals receive insufficient support, and people on social assistance are one small step away from homelessness.\nWith respect to the real estate crisis in B.C. and Ontario, there is an impression that those in charge are turning a blind eye to the suspected corruption that supports the speculation driving prices to a level that makes housing unaffordable for the majority in metro Vancouver.",

In fact stripping a forest can lead to higher temperatures, dryer weather, increased desertification - all currently happening in BC's interior.\n\nBut, I guess the fact that one hires tree-hugging university students to plant saplings every decade or so helps to ameliorate all this environmental damage, despite the fact that a good chunk of the saplings probably end up being planted upside-down - after all crouching and planting is actually hard and grueling work - hard on one's back specifically, especially after the first few dozen saplings get inserted.",

The work may be brought back, but due to automation, the number of jobs will be significantly less.\n\nThen there is the article on RawStory, \"The dark rigidity of fundamentalist rural America: a view from the inside\" that helps to explain the WHY.  It is an important read since it talks about a population that most of us never or rarely interact with.",

As for proportional  representation, I suspect that is an issue for a referendum, as the electorate should make that decision, but this time with a more reasonable process and a 50 per cent plus one vote requirement to win. Gordon Campbell structured it to fail.

He also would wield a baseball bat and with his supporters attack the strike breakers in the fields.  \nI do not know if Dolores swung a bat in her day but she certainly supported those who did.   \n\nBefore she accuses Trump of racism, perhaps she should explain why César Chávez and Donald Trump both agreed on the issue that illegal immigrants were bad for American workers. Dolores supported the violence (directly or indirectly) by the UFW against illegals (or green card holders) in the fields.  Trump only supports enforcement of immigration laws.  Do we really think Dolores Huerta deserves angel wings?",

Trump does not. \n\nCriticizing Trump for taking a legal deduction is logically the same as saying he should have paid more than he was legally required to pay. Unless a person taking this stance pays more taxes than they are legally required to pay, or they at least require anyone they would vote for President to do so, then they are a hypocrite seeking a particular political outcome as the only reason for their hypocrisy.\n\nBy the way, no candidate for President is required to release their taxes.

Did the booking indicate that the 10 year old was in fact a minor, or was that information omitted?  Were they connecting to Costa Rica on AC or another airline?  Was the problem at OLCI that the son could not get a seat assignment, or that he could not check in at all?  The answers to all these questions are needed before it can be determined exactly what happened.  Splitting hairs maybe, but the son was never bumped per se - he likely could have obtained a boarding pass with GTE for seat assignment, and sorted it all out at the airport.

Christ prayed for Peter that Peter's Faith would fail not.   Peter became the first pope after the Resurrection, when Christ told Peter to Feed His Sheep.  \n\nVatican I, as well as any ecumenical council confirmed by a pope, cannot contain error when it teaches on faith or morals solemnly to the universal Church.   \n\nNumerous popes (such as Eugene IV) have taught ex cathedra that there is no salvation outside the Church.   Almost no one assents to this today.  Even groups like SSPX, SSPV, and CMRI reject this Dogma.  \n\nWith most liturgical conservatives today, there is no real Faith:   just a bunch of incense and fancy chasubles with no solid Faith underneath.",

The concourt could, if a case came before it, overrule and reverse this decision but until and unless that happens (and it won't because the ruling is absolutely correct) the precedent stands as the law of the land. That's how common-law works - when a judge rules that a common-law is no longer in sync with the values of society, or unconstitutional, or in contradiction with legislative law - then it ceases to be law and only a new court precedent can change that.\nEven a small-town magistrate has that power (it was such a magistrate who made adultery no longer a punishable offense in the 1920s)\n\nCreating a NEW common law offense works the same way but happens far less often as judges are naturally reticent about convicting somebody of an action they could not have known was a crime at the time they did it.

Harold Gatty believes the Hawaiians may have found their islands by following the spring migration of the golden plover from Tahiti to the Hawaiian chain, as the birds returned to the North American mainland.\n.\n In 1778, Captain Cook was on his third expedition, seeking the elusive Northwest Passage. During late summer, in the North Pacific/Bering Sea, his crew spotted a Pacific Golden Plover, which seemed to be migrating south. Cook wondered if the birds knew something about geography that he didn’t. Possibly Cook was lead to Hawaii by Koloa.",

If it was termed a \"grant\" they would have to include it as spending on their budget and it would add to the deficit.  But if they call it a \"loan\" then it is not considered government spending according to our accounting rules and is kept off-budget.  The loan only comes on-budget at some point in the distant future when the government decided to write off that loan.\n\nAlso loans allow for vastly reduced transparency as the government can (and does) claim that they are not able to satisfy Access To Information requests regarding how much of the previous ~$1B in loans Bombardier has paid back.\n\nThis sort of behaviour proves that for Justin Trudeau and the Liberals \"Open and Transparent government\" is nothing more than an election slogan.",

When the government officially recognized AK Native tribes, they seemed to codify almost every separate native village as a separate tribe, which is radically different than how it was done with the Native American tribes where typically all the villages in an area with the same culture were grouped into a tribe.  That means that while there are fewer Lower 48 tribes, they are much larger.  Estimates place the total number of AK Natives living in AK right now as between 110,000-125,000.  If we were to consolidate those all into one tribe, it still wouldn't even break into the Top 5 of the largest federally-recognized tribes, and represents only about 2% of the total US Native population.",

It has come to a point where a ludicrous conspiracy theory such as the idea that Clinton has had people assassinated gets passed on as valid and legitimate.

But they do have the right to make a Charter claim on such grounds if they could make a religious case, which is doubtful.  So, basically, I think you are correlating laws with values incorrectly. Values do often underpin laws, but not always. We might be able to achieve unitary agreement on the need for age of consent laws, but even then there's debate on the appropriate age, meaning that, it's not in fact a unitary value as encoded in law.

We are in the midst of a state of flux that may see them highly positively correlated then inflect to mildly positive if rates rise.

The first issue is logically self-explanatory while the latter is relevant because it's often difficult for employers to assess the actual qualifications of applicants who are educated and/or trained outside of Canada.

The details of the Astros/Tigers trade has not come out but it is understood that the Tigers will pay some of Verlander's contract. How much is the question. I would guess it will come in around half of Verlander's $28 million salary. This gives Houston a stud starter through the end of 2019 for around $14 million a year. The Rockies would have been wise to pursue Verlander. IF the Rockies hang on to the last wild card spot they will travel to Arizona to face Zack Greinke.

By receiving the Eucharist, Christ unites us to his resurrected self physically and spiritually.  Why would we \"strain a gnat but swallow a camel\" by trying to equate liturgical dance to such benefits when it's right there before us staring us in the face?

Hard to see where they're going. Greens have quickly risen and sputtered before. They peaked in 2001 and dropped ever since (mainly because of scatter-brained leader Liz May).",

It’s a work towards integration, all doors are open, but we cannot say, ‘from here on they can have communion.’ This would be an injury also to marriage, to the couple, because it wouldn’t allow them to proceed on this path of integration. And those two were happy. They used a very beautiful expression: we don’t receive Eucharistic communion, but we receive communion when we visit hospitals and in this and this and this. Their integration is that. If there is something more, the Lord will tell them, but it’s a path, a road.\"\n\nhttp://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/4588/full_text_pope_francis_inflight_interview_from_mexico_to_rome.aspx",

While contributing, it wasn't the Chinese who built our country, it was the people like John A. MacDonald who had the vision of a Canadian confederation... workers would literally have come from anywhere. However, the Chinese were a convenient BC workforce given that they seemed to have no self respect, working for much less than the rest of the workforce and had no concern about personal safety.

Because we incentivized drilling, major gas was found we are now exporting and Nikiski is booming again. South Central is now energy secure for many years to come.

Not ratcheting up tensions further with a power that can wipe you( and the rest of the world) off the map at will, is not appeasement, it’s sanity. Your not dealing with computers, your dealing with humans with a full range of emotions and perceptions. Russia is weak relative to the West, with only natural resources(gas) and nukes as counters to US domination. The country could collapse again in a few years, so a waiting game is a logical choice. Forcing the issue could lead to our end.\n\nI would also add that your recasting the thoroughly discredited “domino theory” theory and trying to apply it to Putin’s Russia. You and the rest of the neo-con wannabes are painting Russia as a goliath that will swallow Europe whole if we let him. Please show me one legitimate study to back this conjecture.

The 3 branches act as a check and balance on the other in order to prevent tyranny of one over the other. Senator Wielechowski by bringing this lawsuit is acting in good faith and we should all be thankful. \nThis can't be an appropriation bill! It contains general legislation.",

As one who was an active Catholic for almost 60 years, I attended a number of funeral masses, for friends and family.  I remember nothing about any of them other than that they were pretty much the same thing as we had all the time. I also remember two funeral masses that I thought were anything but consoling.  The first was for a close friend, a young married woman of 32 who died of cancer.  The priest's homily focused on her as \"sinner\", with an afterthought -  that even though she was a sinner, she (probably anyway), was with God  just as the Good Thief was.  Was her family comforted by the focus on her as sinner instead of as a kind, loving young woman, a daughter, sister, friend and wife?  Was her husband, a widower at 32, comforted by this, especially since he wasn't Catholic? My husband, a Protestant, was horrified by it.  Comment 1",

If a clergy person stood up on the pulpit and said \"No Catholic can support Democrats, because whatever good Democrats stand for, they support slavery--and all people deserve to be free\" would you complain that Catholics campaign for political parties? \n\nYou see, sir, the reality is that liberals don't care about pulpit politics if it suits their agenda.  If a priest said \"no Catholic can support a party that wants to build a wall, not help the poor, allow gun rights--those are not consistent with the Gospel\" would liberals complain?\n\nWhen Nancy Pelosi told Catholic priests to preach on immigration reform--did anyone complain?\n\nLiberal hypocrisy at it's best.

But they are unwilling to reduce defense spending or raise taxes to actually get rid of the debt. Dems would rather have a social safety net than pay off the debt, and I think that is correct too, since raising taxes doesn't seem to be an option.",

If the interest cost of servicing the debt were at the same rate today as it was in 2000 (6.34%, which seemed low at the time), our deficit would be $1.2 Trillion larger than it is.  Knowing those low rates have distorted markets, creating bubbles in stocks, bonds, and housing, the Fed is in the process of normalizing rates, which will increase the deficits, and probably crash all three bubbles.\n\nWhen that happens, expect a world wide Depression and a likely collapse of the world economic system that will make 2008 look like a walk in the park.

The reason is something called “global adjustments” – a fee to cover the cost of green energy and conservation programs that is unrelated to the actual cost of electricity itself. Companies like hers are facing staggering hydro bills of $30,000 or $40,000 a month – mostly because of government investments in green energy that Ontario doesn’t need and can’t use.\"  \n\nWIND AND SOLAR ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN 1/4 OF THE GLOBAL ADJUSTMENT.  Natural Gas, Nuclear, and OPG account for the bulk of it.  New renewables alone are not the cause of higher electricity prices as she implies. \n\nAutomatic Coatings derives revenue from coating pipelines so perhaps they aren't so fond of a shift away from fossil fuels.  The pipeline business also may be the impetus for moving south to Illinois that happens to  burn cheap dirty coal for 50% of their electricity.",
