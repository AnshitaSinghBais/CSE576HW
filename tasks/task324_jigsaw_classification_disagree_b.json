This is no different than early 1800's with the Russians dropping off loads of ethanol so that they could rape the community of it's natural resources without having to kill folks directly. There is no difference at all in my opinion. \nThese communities don't deserve to be raped again.

At the basis of Dignitatis Humanae is a teaching about conscience that is very much tied to what AL teaches about conscience. DH teaches that  religion is essentially something inward; AL teaches that morality is essentially something inward, that it is not essentially about the merely external keeping of rules. At the base of both is a conception of conscience which is Biblical and ecclesiastical, but at the same time inward and personalist.

The Israeli Army, among others, uses them to analyse satellite photographs. Your recent on-line order was likely picked and shipped by someone with ASD. But, as you stated, people with ASD don't contribute to society and live on welfare all their lives.  You're the expert.\n\nParents do pay for it themselves. ASD is not covered by any provincial medical system. You can keep your wallet closed since you haven't paid for anything.  \n\nNext, death to the welfare bums!! They don't pay taxes you know.",

The musher who cares for their dogs the best should also win a cash prize in this race as well as an award. Unfortunately, the way the dogs are treated within this race may amount to criminal animal abuse. The treatment of the dropped dogs, their temporary housing, transportation to staging areas, and temporary handling needs improvement.

The covenant infringes therefore on the rights of heterosexuals broadly, and - given the obvious double standard governing premarital sex - discriminates against women in particular. \n\nTWU, of course, claims exemption on the basis it is a private Christian university.

Nothing concrete about the nature of the abuse is given since that is part of the mental manipulation.  Don't be specific and the mind runs rampant.  Likely, it was \"inappropriate\" touching.  At 15, he himself was still a child.  Humans are not born with knowledge of the American obsession with sexual purity.  At 15, he could not have the perspective of an adult nor the belief that sex is bad and that mere touching would scar someone for life.  Yet he was charged with a felony.  Those that made this charge knowing it would doom this teenager to a life of discrimination and disenfranchisement are, in my opinion, far more evil than the boy.  Yes, he should be able to erase the charges from age 15.  People grow. His life has value.",

In other words, Trump is pandering to coal producing states solely to curry favor with, and get the votes of, those who work in the industry, even though he can't actually fulfill his campaign promise of bringing back jobs.

This is both for fund sales following strong short-term performance and redemptions following short-term under-performance. Same goes for style leadership. For example, growth has outperformed value to start this year by a wide margin. Nor surprisingly, investors are switching their value funds over to growth. Arguably, they should be doing the opposite and take profits on their growth funds and rotate to a short-term under-performing value fund with a PM with a good long-term track record. There are numerous studies indicating that investors under-perform the funds they hold for this reason, and it is more costly than just the difference of passive vs active management.",

However, higher education has purposes beyond the financial; it produces a broader understanding of the world, develops creative and critical thinking based on evidence and reason, teaches organizing and communication skills, helps students learn to research and, hence, learn how to learn, fosters self-discipline and, importantly, aids in developing an informed citizenry. Note that a significant portion of those who were duped by the demagogue to the south were those without higher education. This is not to say that the skills I mention aren't also useful on the job, though their utility may often be ignored by managers or finance writers. Strong organizational, thinking and communication skills have a long-term utilitarian value that often prove more important than understanding current software or techniques of production, most of which will become outmoded. $20K may not be a mistake.",

This impacts all sectors of the economy as the costs are passed down to us all.  Frankly in Ontario, we are suffering greatly just with skyrocketing electricity costs.  Adding another cost to be passed down to us, with no offset,  will almost certainly destroy even more families and small businesses.",

In the adult world (and I often reminded our students of this) some degree of confinement is almost a certainty for most offences: if you or I threaten, steal, damage property, etc the police will be summoned and we will soon find ourselves in the back of a cruiser.\n\nRemoving a cell phone from a kid who's still texting at 2 AM on a school night is not theft, it's the logical consequence imposed by a parent who knows that their kid needs an education a lot more than he needs an addiction to electronic gadgets.

So Kessel is playing on the PP and his opposition is 2nd and 3rd liners with good but not spectacular forward line mates.  A very different picture.\n\nKessel is a support player, a very gifted support player who can take advantage of secondary opposition talent.  Much like Laine.

Those of us in north Surrey, Richmond and south Vancouver, who have been under air pathways for decades, laughed. The planes have to land and take off' we had been told, oh so often. Where do they get off thinking the whole world is going to bend their way? Ha, the  joke was on us. The air transport authorities soon backed down and the new flight paths were rerouted over us.

Using expression that exposes the group to hatred, hate speech seeks to delegitimize group members in the eyes of the majority, reducing their social standing and acceptance within society.  Hate speech, therefore, rises beyond causing distress to individual group members.  It can have a societal impact.  Hate speech lays the groundwork for later, broad attacks on vulnerable groups that can range from discrimination, to ostracism, segregation, deportation, violence and, in the most extreme cases, to genocide.\"\n\nGroups like \"stormfront, summerfront, or what ever front\" - and their followers - practiced that kind of hate speech, and that's what section 13 combatted.",

That was the typical immigrant experience, and any Canadians who object to it, yes, should be questioned to see if bigotry underlies their objection.\n\nBut things changed massively starting in the 1980s. The government decided to vacuum up the world's multimillionaires through investor immigrant programs. It has been THOSE PROGRAMS that have skyrocketed house prices in Vancouver and Richmond and South Surrey and parts of Toronto, pricing out local workers.\n\nCanadians are understandably frustrated with that impact, as it prices out tons of local workers from buying houses.

For example, his complete reversal of environmental policy or current rhetoric with NK.\nNormally I'm one of the first to point out that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence but judging a person by their conduct includes inaction.  In Trump's case, especially since allegations of bigotry, exploiting the alt-right movement, etc. that was part of his campaign and with Bannon included in his administration I think there is room to argue that Trump is avoiding addressing the root of the problem because doing so would likely alienate part of his base if not for more deplorable reasons.",

Secondly, labeling entire countries as xenophobic does not seem particularly enlightened. The columnist may consider that East European countries had to suffer through decades of life under harsh Communist dictatorships, among other things, which led to more poverty, in comparison to Western European countries, for example. Therefore, there are fewer resources to share with newcomers.

Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. \n\nProduction values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine. \n\nI wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.",

Additionally, the US ranks at the bottom for providing maternity and family leave - other nations provide 6 months to a year of leave for mothers and even in some cases fathers, which prevents parents from having to make this extremely difficult choice. Generally jobs here do not allow extended time for maternity. As a HI teacher, I knew many teachers who scrambled to get pregnant in the fall, so they would be able to be home with their newborns in the summer. There is no maternity leave for teachers, so you save up every drop of vacation time you can and pray nothing goes wrong with an early/late due date, bedrest, etc. There are so many ways the system does not support families in this choice.

If I fired a gun off in the air and the bullet struck and killed someone, I may have not intended to do harm, but it's still manslaughter.  In this case, the driver's careless act may not have intended to cause harm but, again, somebody was killed.

Our agreement with State Parks is to reinvest camping fees from Blueberry & Shoup to pay for the maintenance of all four state parks. The state requires L49 to operate and maintain these assets from May 15 - Sept. 15, though we will try to keep a roadside bathroom at Worthington open this winter to try to keep the Pass a little cleaner. This summer, local volunteers rallied with us to donate 6000+ hours/2.6 years worth of time to trail rehab, vegetation control, waste & trash management of these Parks. The permit does not require L49 to be janitors for any commercial events on the pass. We expect all users to do their part to be good stewards of the public lands and respectful of one another.",

These are economically sensitive and far too risky (IMO) for that kind of portfolio. Even the Cdn. banks dropped, on average, 60% in price in the 2007-09 economic turmoil. They too are economically sensitive. Why not build a portfolio largely based on dividend growers that are almost completely immune to the economy? In that 07-09 period the market (TSX) fell about 45%. A high-quality portfolio of pipelines and utilities fell just 9.4% from top to bottom and every one of them raised their dividend in 2007, 2008, 2009, right through the market swoon, every stock, every year paid an increasing dividend. And they have continued to do so every year since. I guess if we have a depression, some won't pay their electricity bills. FYI, U. S., 1929-32, the market declined 81%. Real dividends fell 11%.

Betty Taylor even spoke to the benefits, referencing her recent trip to Chattanooga where they have 10 gigabit service available.\n\nMany local tech companies came to city council meetings over the last year and provided public testimony on specifically how access to high speed internet will help them grow jobs. Pipeworks Studio, for example, has a quality assurance lab that needs to upload and download game packages for testing every day. Each of these packages is very large and requires a great deal of bandwidth to manage. If their bandwidth issues are addressed with the fiber network, Pipeworks could create at least 20 new high paying jobs in the next five years. CONTINUED",

Therefore the smart thing would be to promise it to the Greens and stay in power. Making the change will take years, the party in power will have a lot of say over it, they have time to try and win Greens to their side, and time to rally the troops for an early election before any electoral changes take place.\n\nI think the Liberals would say they agree to proportional representation, rather than lose control of government at this time.

That is not what Jesus taught - the servant has earned his wage.  \n\nIs this group teaching us that children make priests unsuitable pastors but not spouses?

Since no one owns the commons and there is no price to using the commons for one's own purposes, there is no incentive to stop abusing it.  What to do?  Put a price on abusing it; that is, put a price on emitting carbon dioxide.  This is a relatively straightforward calculation to make.  It can be made revenue-neutral to the end consumer by reducing other consumption taxes or income taxes.  \n\nThe advantage is that the government is not telling anyone what to do.  It is simply putting a price on pollution and letting the market figure it out.

The earth and its atmosphere is a gigantic feedback mechanism.  For example, increases in CO2 concentration increase photosynthesis, which converts CO2 to O2 and glucose.  Also, the oceans are a major absorber of CO2 (and no, it does not make the oceans \"acidic\"--a politicized term--the ph always stays above 7.0), where it gets incorporated into tissue and hard shells of marine organisms and/or dissolved in the polar regions and circulated into the deep oceans.

Hitler awarded Ford Germany's highest civilian medal for the help he provided in building up their military.  Ford & GM both had truck factories operating in Germany throughout the war. George Herbert Walker (Bush 41's dad) was convicted of trading with the enemy, even after the war started.

Consequently, \nadding large amounts of variable renewable capacity without storage creates a significant \namount of surplus carbon-free electricity\n\nIs there still anyone in Ontario silly enough to vote for the Wynne Liberals?

This has made it difficult for business to attract or retain skilled professionals.

High land prices mean that livable bungalows and character homes are bulldozed for luxury mansions.\n\nOnce affordable rental apartments are torn down and replaced with micro condos which are purchased primarily as an investment, and often sit empty.\n\nIs being on track to displace Vancouver when it comes to affordability a good thing?

Until Confederation the Indians of Canada's west did pretty much as they liked - they were introduced to a few things that made a difference for good (iron tools, textiles, firearms and horses) and some not for good (European diseases and alcohol) and in Canada nobody settled the West until there were Treaties.  So Jordan your cousins adapted to horses and firearms like a salmon to the Nass River.  And truth be told the idea of a white European working class fellow owning his own horse and gun is a North American story also.  So they grew up together, these cowboys and indians - in Canada somewhat more peacefully than the US.  The real exploitation came from East Canada - and still does.",

Despite protests, nothing has been done to alter police tactics so as to be more life friendly. Unfortunately, sometimes it is necessary to fight fire with fire to produce change. I think probably many of us expected a war against police to break out. I expect it will continue until real attention is paid to change police tactics. Police do not have to be as aggressive as they are except in rare situations.

A few years ago I was shopping for a maid of honour dress for my sister's wedding, and after being told by the sales manager at the store that I can exchange the product, when I tried to do so (because I found a better dress online), they fabricated the claim that I wore the dress and it could not be exchanged making me feel like a worthless liar.  After fighting and arguing with a more senior manager at BCBG, she reluctantly agreed to the exchange for credit only (no returns whatsoever, its not their policy).  After this experience, I refused to shop there ever again, and have since taken my business elsewhere where they allow returns, exchanges and wonderful customer service",

Remember that Jan Smuts lost his \"safe\" UP seat in the 1948 elections. I support the DA position that a majority of MP's should be beholden to their CONSTITUENCIES rather than to the party, but I nevertheless feel that the 75/25 split will certainly be outdated if the Motion-of-no-Confidence in Zuma SUCCEEDS this time around and the ANC splits between pro-Zuma and anti-Zuma factions etc, etc.\nIf we now have elections this year there should not only be a strong drive to implement mixed constituency-based and list-based MP's in future elections, but the number of ministeries should also be constitutionally limited to 25 to 30 ministeries.

In truth Ray Rice knocking out his wife in the elevator was really the beginning, especially with Mr. Goodell handing out a weak 2 week suspension for it till the public outcry hit the NFL. The dog fighting, drugs, shootings, DUI's, murders etc., just add to the NFL's reputation and mystique. After all this for decades, this protest with our nation's flag and anthem, are just frosting on the NFL cake!\n The NFL disrespected just about everything over the decades, why should the flag be any different, it's the NFL after all!\nAnyone remember the \"12 Days of Christmas\" song on the airwaves back when Dan Reeves ran the Broncos, and Mr. Elway was quarterback?

But it's a fair question to ask, if hardly anyone wants tourism to be our bread and butter should Hawaii continue to blindly pursue it and ignore or put substantially less effort towards those sectors most of us do want to grow? \n\nAnd even if we agree that tourism is to remain the primary economic driver in Hawaii do we need to grow it continually? Or is some level of visitors a sufficient amount to insure a stable economy? And if tourism has associate economic negative externalities--and it does everything does--should Hawaii continue to ignore these? \n\nNothing exists in a vacuum. Hawaii is dependent on tourists, but we develop that dependency. If we will not take action to reduce that dependency we should at least try to reduce the problems that said dependency causes us. HTA's desire to constantly increase tourism gives us a diminishing return just as the costs of additional tourists begins to rise.",

Multiply that by the thousands of drivers who use those streets each day and the wasted hours are vast. Additionally, my car uses more fuel since it is running that much longer. Even if each EMX were used to capacity by people who would otherwise drive, the extra fuel used by everyone else who still must drive would dwarf any fuel savings attributable to EMX. The fender benders caused by the disappearing left lanes on 6th and serpentine lanes on 7th add to the external costs of this EMX boondoggle.

If an African American has surgery to lighten their skin and change their hair would that make them Caucasian?  You are born with your race, you are born with your gender. The fact that you might identity with a different gender is a real disorder--put treatment that includes enabling the mental disorder only makes the problem worse.",

It is a complete fool who purposely underestimates Russian intelligence and especially, their long game.  If Putin has demonstrated anything in Russia, it's how you play the right wing conservative traditionalist.  That's why he silences, imprisons, or kills his progressive critics with impunity.

The legislature's own legal counsel stated that it was a loser in court and the legislature knew we didn't have the money to pursue it.  \n\nI would like to know how much did Reps. Mike Chenault, Steve Thompson, Craig Johnson, Charisse Millett, Mark Neuman, Bob Herron, Sens. Anna MacKinnon, John Coghill, Charlie Huggins and Kevin Meyer end up wasting on what proved to be, at best, political posturing?

Income inequality correlates beautifully with living conditions. The lower the inequality, Japan and Sweden, the better the living conditions. The higher the inequality, Portugal and the US, with the UK close behind, the poorer the living conditions in developed countries. (Don’t try to explain it, just accept the data across 23 developed countries. The Spirit Level)\n\nA bigger economy is good for business people if you like to live in a cage – a gated community.

And without stalling, as that unforgiving ground comes up at you so fast. At 1000', at least you have a chance to try a re-start and to pick a landing spot.\n\nI see air taxi cowboys all the time yanking their craft around at a few hundred feet on takeoff.

To put it bluntly they have become a neoliberal, government  propaganda outlet that seems as much to want to manipulate that narrative rather than provide unbiassed news.  Not only have they outsourced their moderation of readers comments to the extent that those comments are unecessarily delayed or agressively censored before being posted in order to shape the public conversation; they have also been very selective on which news articles that comments are allowed in the first place, tending to allow comments only on non-contriversial issues.  Their reporting is very selective at best often over-looking very major stories such as the Dakota Access Pipeline protests or what is going on in Yemen.  I no longer have my browser set to CBC as I did for most of my life.  I have a subscription to the Globe & Mail which provides more diversity and less censorship.",

The only fellows I didn't respect were those-- and I knew many on campus-- who professed to patriotically support the war yet were delighted to see their \"inferiors\" go fight the war.

The median wage in Oregon is around 45000, or about 21.50 per hour. That's uncomfortably close to the new minimum, leading one to believe this has the potential to be very disruptive to the labor market. I hope it doesn't, but this is uncharted territory. From everything I have read, the minimum should be about half of the median, which is about where Oregon was. But in its rush to pass this bill, the legislature took no testimony from an economist that I can find. Not a good idea.",

Good call this time I GUESS- my husband was one of the very front cars in the line that began forming around 2 o'clock and must have stretched back to Tacoma by the time it reopened last night. He gave up at 6:30 and drove around and up the canal to get home. Funny side note: there wasn't word one about the closure on the evening news even though it was ongoing through the commute.
