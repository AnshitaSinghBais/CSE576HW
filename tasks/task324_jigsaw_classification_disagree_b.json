I don't deny the importance of doctrine, but I do deny that it has supreme importance.

As I said to Nora—politely, I hope—there’s not a vertebrate I can think of that doesn’t have a sexual division of labour.  Often the division is apparently arbitrary and not based on size or strength.  I don’t think humans are any different.  The cultural constructs that emerge are conditioned by and large by our biology.

Ontario \"Hydro\" showed how long it takes to get a Nuclear plant back to full power after the Northeast Power failure.\n\nNDP fans like to claim that the Ujjal Dosanjh administration finally balanced that fudged budget by a few million in their final months.

Everyone who has insurance is hurt by increased premiums because of those millions without access to health insurance. What the repeal of the ACA is about now and always has been is that those making more than $200,000/year have to pay a small tax on their capital gains which in turn pays for the subsidies and some of  Medicaid expansion.

Trudeau's only accomplishments to date, like sort of getting along with Trump and a relatively robust but still fragile economy, have been achieved by default. But big minefields exist for the Libs on immigration, NAFTA and aboriginal affairs. On the latter issue, I suspect most Canadians have little interest in the models of aboriginal sovereignty proposed by many First Nations advocates. It will be almost impossible for Trudeau to achieve his vaunted new relationship with First Nations and keep the remaining 96% of Canadians mollified.

China will first amass an army of soldiers along the China-North Korean border to prevent Korean refugees from crossing into China.  China will then cut off all aid to North Korea while the U.S. and South Korea impose a naval blockade of North Korea to prevent ships from entering or leaving North Korea.  It might take a year or two before North Korea collapses, but it is the only way to make it happen short of war without the outside aid North Korea now receives.  Yes, innocent North Koreans may suffer, but probably no more than they suffer now.",

Because the government had the foresight to sign a fixed cost contract with a well-experienced  contractor and it was the contractor that had to eat the extra costs for the tunneling and soil condition problems.  The BC government was adamant that the contractor fulfill its contractual obligations.  \n\nContrast that with the recent report on infrastructure construction mismanagement by the Ontario Liberal government by Ontario Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk.",

The invasive species kill little trees before they can grow high enough to dominate.  Aerial spraying is really the only way to reclaim steep terrain from invasive species.  A selective ban might be reasonable.  A total ban means that difficult terrain currently controlled by invasive species will remain so controlled in the many areas where machines cannot operate safely.  And every time, the blackberries or whatever gain the upper hand, they will keep it.  Eventually, much of the land on terrain where machinery cannot safely operate will be lost to invasive weeds.

It was a grab for the oil that was about to be nationalized by the Iranian PM. Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq was overthrown by the U.S. as was  Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi in Libya. The US also attempted to over-throw Bashar Hafez al-Assad of Syria. In all these cases the outcome for those countries was the creation of chaos and death. John fails to see the connection. The reason the region is on fire is because of destructive imperial over-reach to control the region for oil by Western forces.

Over the 30 plus years there has been a giant improvement which is unequalled in any other country.

On the other hand, there are special moments and contexts that punctuate history and allow us to speak of \"The Gilded Age:\" or now the \"Nostalgic Age\". Nostalgia peaks most sharply in the face of trauma and dread. We prefer to look back from a precipice rather than forward beyond it. As we move over a precipice and survive, that experience can later be recovered nostalgically. Recall that Gott's somewhat reassuring calculations of human survival depend upon the assumption that there is no special circumstance associated with the moment of calculation.

Governments are quick to blame housing prices on speculators, foreign buyers and landlords but fail to look at their own policies as a major contributor to the problem.  To develop land for a new housing development is a costly red tape procedure restricting not only the supply of housing but also adding costs to the ultimate purchaser of the home.   I understand that government charges in the GTA add about 30% to the cost of a new home.  These costs don't include HST on building materials and independent contractor fees and provincial and municipal land transfer taxes .  The \"solutions\" introduced by the Wynne government will fail as they simply don't address the real problem which is the lack of supply caused by both provincial and municipal government policies.  It is basic economics that prices will rise if demand outstrips supply.",

On the other hand, Ovechkin should have been given a 4 minute penalty for his two hander to Crosby's shoulder (then head with the ricochet). Crosby was falling as he reached toward Niskanen and there was no intent on his (Niskanen's) part to actually cross check. He was merely protecting himself from the impact of the collision which, unfortunately, happened to be Crosby's head because he was on his way down to the ice. The game operates at such a rate of speed that collisions such as this are inevitable. When it is slowed down for the benefit of replay everyone gasps and cries foul. If you've played the game lately you'll be amazed at the speed of the players these days. Add in 200+ pounds and 6 plus feet and they are accidents waiting to happen.",

Canada only exists as a result of treaties - treaties that Canada signed on to and now must fulfill.  \n\nIndigenous people will \"stop playing the victim\" when governments and non-Indigenous Canadians stop victimizing 'Indians'.",

Last time I checked they were not being paid with live chickens or some of mom's home-made soup. A recent family doctor spends several months in any given year travelling the world and materially, lacks absolutely nothing.   It is a tough life, I guess, but somebody has to do it.  Meanwhile, his office is a shambles and his staff are poorly paid.  Sorry, but doctors are a major part of the problem, and except to ask for more money, they and their colleges (unions) have done little to help improve the delivery of medical care, at least in the province of Ontario with which I am most familiar.  Canada has by now a very mediocre medical system by \"first world\" standards.  Any number of European countries can dance circles around us in quality and timeliness of medical service delivery.  Our doctor's general sense of entitlement and poor ethics contributes to a good portion of this mediocrity.",

She looked sad and responded, \"Those things kill grandmothers, and grandmothers' grandsons, too.\" Then she excused herself and went to her bedroom. It was a tiny apartment, so I could hear her crying. I was petrified, like any young adolescent boy would be. After a few minutes she came out, red eyed, and sat back down to finish the tea and strawberries. I felt terrible and started to cry. She gave me a hug, dried my eyes, and gave me more cake and strawberry preserve. I never went to another military parade again.",

However, our fastidious and hypersensitive age has lost touch with the rich, wise past and has turned things on their heads. It is now transforming one of our very few intervals of liberation into a day on which we must intensify the conventions and repressions that we act out during the rest of the year.

The missed inception can be accounted for by the combined effect of relatively high late-Holocene CO2 concentrations and the low orbital eccentricity of the Earth. Additionally, our analysis suggests that even in the absence of human perturbations no substantial build-up of ice sheets would occur within the next several thousand years and that the current interglacial would probably last for another 50,000 years. However, moderate anthropogenic cumulative CO2 emissions of 1,000 to 1,500 gigatonnes of carbon will postpone the next glacial inception by at least 100,000 years.\"\n\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7585/full/nature16494.html",

There was no statute of limitations for this sin/crime and the punishment for it was and still is, immediate excommunication. The lawyers thought that at last the victims were going to get some sort of justice.\n\nThey were wrong. Ratzinger himself imposed a statute of limitation on that particular crime.

The prayers are said with great respect, not intoned, and the parts meant to be chanted are chanted, not recited. Each gesture has a meaning, and no gestures are added.

Right where this swarm occurred, the conduit from Kilauea to the East Rift Zone takes a sharp dogleg left at about Puhimau Crater.  Likely the conduit is quite fractured in this area, which along with the sharp bend presents an obstacle to the magma.  A large pulse of magma probably was released from the Kilauea magma chamber and when it hit this spot, backpressure developed and caused this swarm.  The relative inflation/deflation curves for Kilauea and Pu'u \"O\" support this (no sharp inflation at Pu'u \"O\" yet).  \n\nNote that the magma conduit is relatively close to the surface in this area.  There's a 50-acre spot near Puhimau where the ground has heated enough to kill the 'ohia trees and most plants, with quite a bit of steaming in that area.  A very interesting spot.\n\nThis isn't the first swarm at that dogleg, but it's remarkable for the size of the quakes and tight clustering in time.",

The average of the three new measures was 1.5% in June 2015 as opposed to only 1.4% in June 2017. Journos like Lundgren seem to have completely forgotten the old CPIX measure of inflation since the 2016 renewal agreement plutoed it but it hasn’t gone away. In June 2015 it was sitting at 2.3%, above the target rate of inflation; in June 2017, it was at 0.9%, below the 1% lower bound.

I suspect that the annual growth will also be weaker than the Bank’s current forecast. In spite of strong growth from 2016Q3 forward, I doubt that the Bank of Canada will raise its overnight rate this year. The dysfunctional 2016 renewal agreement, that gave the Bank not one but three core measures of inflation designated as the operational guide, none of which take mortgage interest cost out of the mix, will provide him with an excuse for keeping the overnight rate where it is.

And this was coming off a recent tour of the Champagne district in France. True, France has had a significant head start (and it was wonderful and exciting and to die for) but the wine trail in BC, in my view, was more than equal, in its own way, to France.

Taxes are the peoples money that we permit the government to use. Those taxes are coming from the same riders that ride the rail as well as those that do not ride it.\nThe original stated goal of the rail, 12 years ago, was to get more cars off the streets. the only way to accomplish that is to make the incentive for riding it a no brainer.  If it is free to ride and is fully subsidized, then the ridership will get more cars off the street.  it is already subsidized about 85%. screw that last 15 %, just do it 100% and stop pissing around.

I see your words and sense your fear, so I am having a difficult time understanding or quantifying the basis for it as a first step in finding a way to communicate substantively and find solutions. How can we find ways to work together to advance the Kingdom of God so long as you are screaming about what is dividing society and promoting those concepts inside the body of believers?",

You assert that 1) no corrective action was taken by management to control cost, and 2) it would be irresponsible to continue to fund rail.\n\n1) HART construction contracts are fixed price contracts with fixed duration from the time notice to proceed is issued.  When a contract is signed, the cost is set.  The contract price is changed only when HART issues a change order (which is what a CF is for).  Unexpected events, e.g., a work stoppage beyond HART's control (from strikes, lawsuits and disasters, natural or otherwise) are not in the budget except as a CF item.\n\n2) If funding for HART is cut off, It will mean $billions of Fed funds must be returned and $multi-Million to be spent to terminate existing contracts.  HART will receive no Fed funds after that.  Do you believe that's the better alternative?    \n\nThis will  be my last comment on this issue.  Sayonara.\n\nFM",

In the end, the process that ends his presidency will be a political one; but the political process will be driven by the legal process: the Mueller investigation. However, from the demise of the Trump presidency, a revival of Democrats (in Congress or in the White House) does not necessarily follow.

In the Western Church, Women deacons, too, preached the Gospel but only to other women, and went into places where men were not allowed.  The exact history of female deacons - particularly in Roman Catholicism - in muddied with twists and turns, regional and cultural differences, thus the varied interpretations.  By the twelfth century, women deacons disappeared in both Eastern and Western churches, it seems that menstruation was the reason for forbidding women being ordained to any clerical rank.

'Critical thinking' about politics in the US is virtually impossible if you don't know the basic 'facts'.

Today it serves maybe 12 million people, the problem is that the population has exploded and your economy is way too small and cannot  be said to serve all who live in South Africa. \n\nIf you want to avoid a human disaster that will make the Kynsna fires seem small, then find a leader who will serve all the people and unleash their potential.",

Well maybe, which sounds like an incentive not to sign up.\n\nMy kid has the highest marks in her school all through HS, getting 98 in advanced placement math (another messed up didn't deliver program, though she loves it).  She probably won't get any scholarships because she has a disorganized Chem teacher.

Ob care has encouraged employers (like sound publishing) not to invest and take care of their employees, sadly this has led to many companies loosing talent to other employers who still do invest in their staff. Another second level of issue that OB care has created is less full time work, many employees find that is costs less to have two or three part time employees then one full time because now emplyers do not have to provide medical benefits.  That being said, I too think the R's are missing the boat and replacing one garbage policy with another.  It is a marathon not a race to get this replaced.  Lastly to say someone has insurance is kind of a stretch where if you want a reasonable deductible with AHA, your payments will be 12-1300 per month.",

WE are very skeptical of Trickle-down economics. One can make a case for Trickle-down before WWII but not long after it was supplanted by the jobs created by small business.  \nWe do not believe in American Exceptionalism or the GOP belief in \"The Divine Right' of the GOP or the Super Rich. \nStay awhile read our positions and our style, then post. Your ideas might be much better heard. \nfini",

Russia as the USSR made such good friends with all the other Central European states (former Warsaw Pact members) they could not run to NATO fast enough.  That \"run to NATO\" is realpolitik: the real consequences (fear, hatred, mistrust, so many others...) due for occupying those countries for nearly 50 years.  As for the Cuba side issue:  USSR could have as many troops as they wanted, but no first-strike nuclear weapons on Cuba - that why it was called the \"Missile Crisis\", not the \"Invasion Crisis\".  \n\nFinally, as for responding to Article 5, I suppose the only way to find out is for Putin to invade, and take the chance of starting WW3.  You think Latvia is not significant enough for NATO to defend it.  I think Putin would be very unwise to test NATO over something so relatively insignificant as Latvia.  So is Putin a wise leader of Russia, or just a wise guy?",

Yes, it gives younger players a chance to play, but there is no comparison in the eyes of the audience to a competition where the world's best players are in attendance.

The Kurds were one of the first forces to stand up effectively against ISIL as the government of Iraq teetered on falling in late 2015.  Canada supplied training, equipment, and tactical support, an investment in the Kurds that paid off well as they were arguably the most effective fighting force against the terrorists.

Consequently, \nadding large amounts of variable renewable capacity without storage creates a significant \namount of surplus carbon-free electricity\n\nIs there still anyone in Ontario silly enough to vote for the Wynne Liberals?

If we had to stay at the shelter, I'm absolutely sure we would still be homeless today because there is NO help for people who are not addicts or mentally ill and have no dependent children.

One example is the endless streams of studies (some with as few as 20 in the sample group) used to illustrate an idea someone wants to sell, even though studies with tiny sample groups are almost meaningless.  \n\nIn some ways I find this subtle orientation of facts more disturbing than outright lies.

Gnostics were the \"anti-Christs\" Paul and John were talking about.\n\nAdventism is the most anti-Gnostic denomination today.

The problem isn't the lack of money pouring into the government. The problem is  government spending and the appalling waste.

Is there one vice you do not possess? Ye have no more religion than my horse; gold is your God; which of you have not barter'd your conscience for bribes?

The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from 280 ppm to about 405 ppm since the early 19th century - measurable, proveably true. That's about the same amount found in the Pliocene Era, which still had fully functioning ecosystems, flora and fauna, so it's not the apocalypse. Should we continue? Probably not, but hydrocarbons as energy sources are remarkably good compared to other source of energy. Why not find a carbon neutral way to produce it without requiring fossil resources, perhaps from plants that recycle CO2? How about reducing energy use in our many devices? Why not different solutions for different places - diesel is a great way to heat homes here, solar is better for air conditioning in Tucson - and any solution that mires people in poverty by limiting energy resources for them is a nonstarter.

The French people recognizes their glorious first world status is over. Downsize everything by 30-40%. They have done this before, after WW2.

Hmm, let's not solve this problem by doing the obvious simple fixes, paying them more, taxing them less. Let's solve the problem by having them incorporate so that the federal government shares the pain through lower tax revenue. Of course we rely on that same federal government for transfer payments, and we are also loading a whole layer of expenses (accountants) onto the backs of doctors, but so what.\" How twisted is that logic, one would have to cry if one couldn't laugh.",

They started having food shortages, because people refused to be in the country because of the higher burden of tax. The cities where ultimately a service industry, they shifted to mostly import of goods. They collapsed. See our founding fathers, wanted equal representation to prevent collapse. To prevent a group of wolves from deciding everything for a few sheep, so to speak. 5 times in our history has the president won electoral college and lost the popular vote. Out of 200+ years, only 20 years has a president not won both and all 5 times it was a separation of less than .5% of the voter and less than .0025 % of the actual population.

I think this is morally wrong, because it is no longer a free choice when you are holding something that the person needs.\nClearly there are many people not bothered by the above who want to support religious charities, and that is their choice, but I prefer to give to secular, humanist charities.\nAlso, many atheists do give to charity regularly, and I, at least, find it mildly annoying to have people constantly assuming that charity is always motivated by religion.",

A company like that can carry a lot of debt on their balance sheet and still be a low-risk investment. One needs to understand each company's business model, what they do, their contracts and how solid they are, the term of their loans, the risk of changes in interest rates to them, changes in goods' and services' pricing etc. and how all of these changes can affect each company. The level of risk is very different for a company that sells a commodity vs. one that provides, for example, electricity under a 25-year fixed-price, adjusted-for-infation contract. \n\nIf you look at one number, the level of debt on a company's balance sheet, you have learned essentially nothing.  \n\nI realize you disagree.\n\nSFI",

I have never had an issue with the frequency of the buses - the 13 route is once an hour (I think an extra one comes around between 8 and 9am). I don't really see how this system is better if it potentially involves more walking, especially in a cold-climate city like Anchorage.
