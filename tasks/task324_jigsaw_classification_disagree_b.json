It's much more accurate to say that monarch populations have declined 43%. Mind you, I'm not saying that that's somehow \"acceptable\", but at this point herbicide-tolerant crops have essentially reached saturation. If there is further habitat loss, it has to be due to some other factor.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out the opposite side of the issue.

If you think Indian status is complicated on mainland Canada, it is more so on the Island of Newfoundland. When NL joined Canada it was supposed Island Mi'kmaq would fall under the Indian Act. Turns out the feds were already planning to wean Canada's aboriginals off government subsidies and so St. Laurent denied federal responsibility. NL had neither the wherewithal nor inclination to fill in for the feds and so NL's innu languished in no-man's land for decades. The province was also convinced its Mi'kmaq were not aboriginal, at least not to NL - that their arrival post-dated the European presence there (and hence with no stronger land claim than any other settler). The criteria for Qalipu status is more narrow than the national model; they must have a current and substantial connection to native communities on the Island. And that, it turns out, accounts for the vast majority of the rejections. \n\nClear as mud?",

We are not required to impose Catholic values on our secular constitutional nation.

Fund balances are not the result of simply asking for money than expected need.

So the demand window for at least 40 bcf a day is there. It`s just a question of what an investor expects as a rate of return on the investment.  If Alaska bears, with it`s vast resource value, a lower internal rate of return than Exxon investors and enjoy the tax status we would receive from investing in state infrastructure (like a common carrier gasline!) then we would reap the other \"benefits\" of limitless affordable natural gas across this state in short order.

Extensive research and study have confirmed this for me, coupled with a healthy dose of common sense and plain reading of scripture (once forbidden by the Roman bishopric). I thusly have no desire to be a \"good Catholic\" or to assent to Catholic teaching. Just look at the silly things that \"faithful Catholics\" feel the need to debate and--even worse--to equivocate. In all honesty I find the traditional RC point of view both dangerous and embarrassing--wrongheaded to say the least. I have seen first hand well-intentioned people needlessly suffer in their vain attempts to appease Rome and her superfluous doctrines, to the point of illness (both mental and physical), as well as suicide. Enough is enough. We need to get back to the basics as Pope Francis has advocated. The reforms he has made barely scratch the surface, a total restructuring is needed which we are unlikely to see.",

They provide liquidity in the market, and help prices move to their natural level, which they clearly have not done in Toronto yet. They are also taking a big risk for their efforts, which most people don't realize. Things can decline at any time. When that happens, they could end up taking huge losses.

But it seems the recreational needs of Anchoragites are being held hostage by those few who can afford to live in the areas where improved access is possible and desperately needed.",

Captain Perez is correct about many national monuments being treasures that tell the story of our military.  I would be offended and outraged it the Trump administration was to rescind or reduce any in size, but I seriously doubt such will happen.  I believe the review is focusing primarily on the hundreds of thousand acres of wide open spaces ranchers once used to graze cattle but were forced out by Obama’s unprecedented expansion and creation of new national monuments, perhaps to protect a few wild animals and to keep environmentalists happy.

On occasion I've heard senior management of Shell SA telling local communities that the life of a well is '10 to 15 years'. The context of that statement is related to the job-hungry audience who clearly seek reassurance the benefits (of shale gas) that they are being promised, will last (about) 10-15 years.\nThose sessions, in my experience, permitted little opportunity for robust and truthful debate, being controlled by Shell, and in my view, the trend of overstating positive benefits whilst ignoring negative consequences is well established within the historical context of this debate.

PF is well aware of how the papacy came into existence (and subsequent rise to power), hence his humble preference to be addressed as the Bishop of Rome.\n\nWhat makes your stance on faith so precarious is your reliance on the \"chair of Peter\" to uphold ancient forms/customs/doctrines as validation (if not outright substitution) for your own personal faith.

Indeed, one could say that Canada's duty to its troops on the ground, many of whom were either killed or grievously wounded by IED's, made it imperative to interrogate him.",

The needs of the State were considered before Statehood, and it was recognized that Alaska could not support itself via the traditional means of other states...income taxes.  Thus the Federal Government required the State to maintain mineral rights to pay for government.  The mineral rights of those that live in other states have no bearing on this discussion.  \n\nIf this concept represent communism, then I guess you have me labeled correctly.

That is about $50.4 million per mile.  HART, if it ever gets finished, will be 20 miles long and at current estimates will cost $500 million per mile, or ten times more per mile than it cost the Japanese to build its new Hokkaido line.  New York’s East Side Access is 6 miles in a tunnel.   Current cost estimate is $10.2 billion or $1.7 billion per mile, or 34 times more than the Japanese rail project.  Yes, there are differences in labor and materials cost between the three locations, but 10 and 34 times more?  I do think so.

We also allowed large portions of this state to remain dependent on the state for government services.  Generations of legislators denied that oil is a ultimately non-renewable resource and no amount of promises or inducements to find more can overcome that fact.   \n   A population our size cannot generate the necessary tax revenues that don't risk creating more problems.   \"Modest\" is a very subjective term.

Obviously those people have zero experience with the preconcillar tradition. Hence, I don't see how a heavy-handed imposition of the liturgical reform would spur them to do this, as they have no recollection of such imposition.\n\nMy inclination is that the younger generation finds comfort in old tradition because they lack the bravery to confront (or are uncomfortable confronting) new challenges.

If you sacrificed/ saved back then, you could probably expect to save a bigger % down payment over time. That dynamic hasn't existed for most people for many years.\n\nAlso, if you bought back then, you subsequently paid off your mortgage in a declining rate environment that lasted for decades. Think: people buying today will never experience anything like that. For perspective, imagine a housing market where rates had stayed at 20% this entire time AND prices had for many years been climbing faster than people could save a bigger down payment.\n\nHousing affordability problems are long-standing, systemic, government-driven, and future-harming. \n\nRespectfully, preaching patience suggests that you likely have not considered the above points and are benefiting from the status quo.",

The latest electrical generation figures from the EIA from 2015 break down the US 4 trillion kilowatts market like this, coal 33%, natural gas 33%, nuclear 20%, hydro 6%, petroleum 1%, renewables other than hydro 7% (wind 4.7%, biomass 1.6%, solar .6%, geothermal .4%). These figures do not even take into consideration the energy used by the transportation industry which almost exclusively relies on fossil fuels.\n\nSo based on the statistical analysis of the watts, btu or joules of energy per job, fossil fuels, if they truly are fewer in number, deliver a vastly superior return to the consumer.",

(Gaza Vermes  (1983), in Jesus and the World of Judaism, gives a linguistic explanation.)  \n\nBy using Abba, Jesus made the point that God was deeply personal and merciful, and as involved as any earthly father, and conveyed his position as an obedient son of the Father, not a rebel or heretic.",

We are all human, we are all born on a continuum of male/female; your clothes, hair, makeup, mannerisms, etc. do not make you male or female. Your DNA, hormones, gene expression, is unique for each person, but it doesn't make each person a new species. A man with long hair and makeup is not a woman, a woman with short hair and jeans is not a man. They are what they are, and that should be OK. It should be enough.

Does the robber get off by claiming he had consent to take her purse, a claim that she can't refute?

It will be sad to see it go in a few weeks, but the reality is that it costs a lot to keep it going & my parents should now look to using the money for their retirement as their health declines.  When I was a kid we drove up when school ended and came back to the city just in time to go back to school.  In the summer we worked at local parks and restaurants and made lifelong friends.  However as my siblings and I have married and had families of our own, things have changed.  None of us can afford to keep it going ourselves; when both parents work, there isn't the stretch of time in the summer to spend there; and weekend traffic doesn't always make it a worthwhile trip.  Finally, I have always said I would rather lose the cottage than fight over property with my siblings (and I guarantee there would be disagreements).  We will sadly say goodbye and focus on making different, but still special, memories for our kids.",

If we use that ratio to extract what Alaska might require with its population of 738,000, you would need 184 employees to manage, audit, and enforce tax collection.\n\nAnd using the IRS ratio is probably low -- the IRS complains all the time that they can't do the job properly with their resources, resulting in low audit rates. And the IRS has a long history and some economy of scale. So an Alaska IRS would probably struggle with a 184-employee workforce.\n\nI believe I saw $35 million as a State estimate for the annual costs of income tax collection from a previous article.

This makes them perfect for intensely urban areas like King Street.    \n\n- Electric LRT are less costly to maintain than gas powered vehicles.   \n\n- More people per LRT vehicle means fewer drivers and a lower operating cost.  \n\n- LRT operate in tracks which means stations can be wheel chair accessible.",

As most scholars of the field (and not just leftist scholars) will tell you, you have to draw an clear distinction between the ideas of Marx himself and their later development:  one of which was Soviet style communism, but there are other schools of non-authoritarian Marxist thought.  When discussing Marx himself (e.g., the Manifesto or Capital) it is customary to refer to Marxian ideas--most of which were a critique of capitalism and almost none of which were about \"communism\", however defined.",

Lastly, there is no such thing as a \"Indian tribal court\" whereby Constitutional-guaranteed protections are absent as the \"Tribal court\" is not found anywhere in the Constitution's Article III and the 'tribal  court' and 'tribal community' are one in the same.",

Some would like to hang people. \n\nIt's too bad we can't allow SB 91 to run its course and hopefully improve things for everyone.  No, we have to run amok and burn down the barn with Frankenstein monster in it rather than address the true causes for much of today's crime, which is poverty and addiction. \n\nFrom what I read in the paper, most of those who commit crimes get caught and go to jail.  Few remain free.  Unless of course they are the super connected from wealth, executive positions in corporations or political politicians.

Tell people about how the Russians stole the election for Trump and everyone knows you’re just reiterating a Beltway talking point. Mention how the Democrats betrayed working people over the years, however, and the radio station’s board immediately lights up with enthusiastic callers. Remind people of the ways in which the Democrats have reoriented themselves around affluent, tasteful white-collar people and you hear a chorus of angry yesses; talk about how the Democrats live to serve the so-called “creative class” and a murmur of recognition sweeps the room. \"",

It's also very important to him that he surround himself with people who, like himself, other people can’t stand to work with.\nIt's like reliving the first days of Trumpism all over again.\nWhat's most impressive is how diligently they're working to find people that match the Trump criteria.\nSomewhere in the Trump White House there's a gilded Ouija board being used to find all the bosses in America who are most hated by their own underlings; a magical Hogwarts owl with a bad toupee is then sent forth to offer those people top spots in a Trump-headed government.",

My image is of a life-long half-way-house for prisoners on parole. For confirmed pedophiles, I imagine such a permanent constraint, accepted in obedience, is virtually the only way to prevent recidivism. Am I wrong?\n\nWould you still prefer dismissal over such restraint? And more importantly, do you think victims would regard such restraint as preferable to releasing a pedophile back into the general population?",

Many times it's better to delay charges to enable you to present a rock solid case because the US justice system is not designed to take every case to trial and therefore Prosecutors actively look for \"weak\" cases to either kill, or offer a very weak plea bargin on so the defendant will plead out early.",

So could we support learning mathematics as a skill and as a stand-alone content? But we get hung up on algebra 1, geometry, algebra 2, trig/pre-calculus. There nothing inherently magical about this sequence, and the timing...it just is how we did it in college. And then this infuses downward...physics first folks argue that we should teach physics befor chemistry, and chemical before biology..why not?

CO2 will significantly increase the oil recovery and that additional oil should payout the CO2 processing cost.\n\n2) CO2 is a real problem at an LNG plant - solid dry ice doesn't go through the gas compressors very well.  CO2 in a gas pipeline just uses up space, but regardless, the specification on allowable CO2 content in pipeline gas is much higher than for gas to an LNG plant.\n\nYou need to find a friendly petroleum engineer to fact check these kind of stories before they get printed in the paper.

Where is he/she? \n2. Accountability: this obviously starts with the culture that leadership establishes. As a start in ensuring transformation, mayors' offices should be located in the poorest parts of the city they administer. \n3. A Social project that focusses on Child and Adolescent wellness - this will transform society beyond handing out of social grants that seems to be DSD's main order of business.

It would be the second coming (no pun intended) of Tim Tebow, only with race instead of religion.\n\nWhy would any team risk that for a QB that couldn't even beat out Blaine Gabbert for a job on a team that ran a system tailor built for an athletic QB?",

The reason is simple: the administration told them this lie.\n\nAn investigation by a committee in the House of Representatives in 2004 identified “237 misleading statements about the threat posed by Iraq that were made by President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Powell, and National Security Advisor Rice. These statements were made in 125 separate appearances, consisting of 40 speeches, 26 press conferences and briefings, 53 interviews, 4 written statements, and 2 congressional testimonies.” According to the committee, at least 61 separate statements “misrepresented Iraq’s ties to al-Qaeda.” A Senate investigation in 2006 also covered these lies.\"\n\nhttps://www.antiwar.com/blog/2013/03/18/911-and-iraq-the-wars-greatest-lie/",

Each confirmation is like finding an unexpected bonus in my paycheck and gives me more reason to want to love and obey Him and continue doing whatever He wants me doing.\n\nI pray that you will let God show you the mission purpose He wants you doing in His power so you can have your own experience with the Holy Spirit.

If Jesus believed she should be separated out during temple worship he would have met her outside.  Women were kept outside during worship during the time of menses or while they were bleeding but scripture does not demand women be kept out when they are not bleeding (although there were sects who did).  Men who were bleeding or sick also had to stay in a periphery area instead of in the center area.  This is because the Jews & the law viewed blood issue as sacramentally unclean.  Jesus even breaks this law later on because all who are his disciples are made sacramentally clean thru him so this bias is sin now",

Liberals didn’t like it because it would have hurt so many people -- upwards of 24 million people would have lost health insurance and health care.\nDuring the campaign and transition and even in the early days of his presidency, Trump promised simultaneous repair/replace, seamless transition, universal coverage, lower costs and better health care. He was lying. \nRyan promised that when the Republicans replace the ACA, no-one, not one American, will be worse off than under the ACA. He was lying.\nI don’t know how many people voted for Trump because they believed his promises about health care, but those who did ought to insist that he propose a health care plan that reflects those promises.",

When I was in my late twenties, I had the chance to live for a year on the Six Nations of the Grand River.  Because I respected the people, I was treated accordingly. One night while on the way to a dance off the Reserve, I asked the driver if only Indians would be there. He replied, \"You're an Indian, sort of.\"  Nice!\n\nCanada's treatment of the First Nations sanctioned by the government under the aegis of Christian clergy unleashed a legacy of racial terror upon children of the First Nations.  Only when Canadians en mass come to terms with this blight upon our historical pass, will Canada attain its high destiny.

Obamacare is still the standard most Republicans want to shoot for and much of the Republican plan is straight out of Obamacare. But they had to make changes for 10-12 conservatives. They hope Senate fixes things. Obama and the Dems exaggerated what Obamacare would do and when problems started in the markets, they (and insurers) either did not see or tried to hide developing problems. Insurers are to blame, but they did not get subsidies they are entitled due litigation under a provision inserted by a Republican (Marco Rubio). The insurance companies are part of the market screwup in underpricing to get customers but worried about the subsidies they were not getting and which they thought might be stopped by Trump or Republicans.

Korea with his conventionals, once he has the tech to actually deliver a nuke.  Again, not sure how that would benefit, either.\n\nI think it's a bunch of hot air, personally.  Can't see a way of Kim winning any military confrontation.  I've no idea of the mentality of his citizens, though.  Maybe they even believe in the guy?",

Two current Supreme Court justices, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Clarence Thomas, did not receive 60 confirmation votes.\n\nBut under current Senate rules, ending debate or a filibuster over a Supreme Court nominee — called a cloture vote — requires a three-fifths majority. Eight Democrats would need to vote for cloture to end debate over Judge Gorsuch and bring his nomination to a straight up-down vote.\n\nThe Senate has moved to invoke cloture only four times for Supreme Court nominations in history, most recently in 2006 for Justice Alito’s confirmation when it voted 72-25 to end debate.\n\nMr. Schumer is right that the most successful nominees have met the 60-vote bar at some point.

Swift is a celebrity with enormous wealth and power, which she used to great effect with her frivolous lawsuit.  I'm just saying: if you're a shop girl working for minimum wage the courts are not a realistic option.

Russian forces performed badly in Chechnya, relying on firepower to grind a lightly armed adversary into dust. In the war with Georgia, Russian ground forces were painfully slow and would have been an easy target to a NATO nation. They haven't done all that well in Syria either having just been booted out of the T4 airbase in Palmyra by ISIS . The Russian army still uses mostly equipment that dates from the early 90s. The air wing from Admiral Kuznetsov had to be transferred to a ground base in Syria since the ship is falling apart. Furthermore, Russian dependence  on oil exports makes it an easy target for embargo and sanctions.The point is, such action would leave no choice for NATO but to fully implement article 5. It's simply a matter of time before NATO's military, which is mostly out of reach to Russia, would compel your government into contemplating a nuclear option.

You look at good tight ends, it's almost always a product of a good athlete at the position and a QB who can use the middle of the field and the seams in the passing game. It's also a position that many QB's take advantage of for check downs and progression of reads as the tight end is often the third or even fourth read in a QB's progression. Siemian has not exhibited the ability to consistently use the middle of the field in the passing game and I think that is a major reason why the Broncos tight end production has suffered since Manning retired. I think the talent is there at the position, we've seen these guys get open every game and they catch the ball when it comes their way, they're just not targeted more than maybe a handful of times per game.   \n\nDerby is averaging 3.8 targets per game, Green 1.7 and Heuerman 0.8; none have dropped a pass.",

He/she only knows 'what they say they believe or think' so that is the only proper way to describe their words. You can report that the person 'appeared sorrowful, with tears running down his cheeks' but saying the person was sorrowful is beyond a reporter's skill level. He told me he had learned these lessons by doing it wrong, and reflecting. He made me reflect. He was right, and I don't know how he'd react to the egregious editorializing in print and on TV, as just now on The National, and its presentation as fact, but I can imagine. He was a great man. RIP. Quote me on that.",

Come to think of it, saying so isn't really that far-fetched from reality as, while bazookas are regulated, grenade launchers and anti-tank weapons are legal. Go figure. My point is, whatever weapons one deems should be legalized or regulated, the line must be drawn somewhere, for if there is no line to cross, what would prevent one from purchasing a military tank.

The other issue is that when Goff got his chance to play over CK the Rams never looked back. When Lynch got his chance to play they handed the job right back to Siemian. So I think the question is this:A)Do you play Lynch when he is healthy no matter what and just call it a season?\nB) Or do you continue with Siemian and try to make the playoffs?\nIt depends on how the coaching staff sees the team. The Rams knew they couldn't compete with the Seahawks or Cards for the division title so going with Goff was a real option. Denver right now stands 1 game out of 1st place and have already beaten two division opponents. It might be tough to convince VJ that A is the better option.\nThe Little Guy",

But the gap between bad military option and harmful NK progress in weaponry is narrowing. We need to see Chinese and Russians step up their pressure.

Sin sets itself against God's love for us and turns our hearts away from it.

The whole point of my argument is that once some purchases any lands it should be there's to decide what to do with it. Selling at fair market value would be appropriate. Forced to sell at 10% value should not be acceptable. Our Constitution is continually altered to suit the government's desires, not we the people's.

The fact that he has set up tribunals and is the first Pope to have prosecutions of abusers(such as the case involving priests from El Salvador) is also pretty historic given that every Pope before him going back to John XXIII failed to do so. \n\nSo even though people may not like the pace of how this are going, the Pope in his own way is making changes slowly and incrementally that in the long run in the future, will seem substantial.",

In my career I've had massive grants from reviews by people in the same topic who thought it was the answer to everything; outright rejection from reviewers working in different fields who thought the ideas worthless  - all for the same topic area. I've also served on enough review committees to know what a disorganised jungle the review system is.- millions of $ depending on someone's spur of the moment likes or dislikes.

We also are the only state with zero members of the minority party in one of our chambers. Our elections are not competitive. Few people want to vote for Republicans. Voters prefer Democrats, yet that does not produce laws which deliver on the Democratic platform's commitment to working and middle class voters. To paraphrase a bumpersticker, \"Why Vote?

ALL  the WH team except the president is unelected.  This is how the US executive branch works.  It enables the POTUS to appoint cabinet and other key personnel on their merits, their relevant experience and abilities, rather than on extraneous identity politics criteria.\n\nThree,  it is insulting to Ivanka to say she is a female counterpart to Justin Trudeau.

That's roughly double the surface area of the river at present. The area to be flooded represents 0.4% of Ag land in the Peace River district and 0.2% of Ag land in BC.  If that will feed 1 million, the balance of Peace River Ag land can feed almost 140 million Canadians. \n\nAlternative energy sources? A  windmill has a 20 year lifespan. A dam's electrical generation capacity is approximately 100 years.  The Paris accord requires CO2 cuts of 30% by 2030, the transportation sector which contributes 27% of CO at present, must be electrified. The claim that we can rely on the Columbia River (USA) dam's capacity is foolish. When Trump says America First, it means everyone else last. The only energy security we can count on is our domestic supply.\n\nFinally, blowing off about $5 billion to mothball a $9  or $10 billion project is astoundingly stupid.",
