Thus the cost cannot be outrageously high. \n\nIt is generally accepted that the US medical system, not health care system, is the best in the world. Thus one could expect to pay more than people in other countries.\n\nWith health care in the private sector, those who cannot pay enough will need support. So government would be stuck with paying health care for only about 15% of the population.\n\n Canadians would select what level of care and thus cost that they want.

Tons of students were late and the scheduling had to be carefully done to ensure they weren't expected to do Math first thing in the morning - when most of them were still basically asleep. This was a particularly difficult problem for Horizon since we are an optional attendance school and many of our students commute fair distances to get to school. Changing the start time has been amazing. The students are on time. They are awake and ready to learn - no matter what the class on their schedule. They are happier.

Everyone should feel the pain equally when addressing our economic issues. We need to diversify our economy and we should be willing to pay for the services we receive: road maintenance, security, education, healthcare, etc. An income tax is the fairest and easiest way to make Alaskans pay for services while only charging them what they can afford. It is the easiest tax to set up and monitor and it would result in nonresidents who work in Alaska also helping to pay for those services. The first $25,000 should be untaxed for all Alaskans and then there should be a fixed, flat tax on all earnings above that (5%?) - no loopholes. Nonresidents should have to pay 5% on all earnings.",

I've heard it's as high as $15k, maybe more in some cases, but a great deal of variance can happen. I've heard a low of $3k-5k per unit. Note that many older condos have to deal with asbestos and other issues making the job not $3k-5k just for sprinklers. Asbestos abatement in my unit cost me over $3k just to scrape the ceiling, not replacing the finish. So that makes my ball park estimate about $10k or so per unit with finish coat and no drop down ceiling to cover pipes. And my unit was a smaller single bedroom one. I would encourage the city to give us a property tax credit, or funding resources and make sure we can confine the cost to sprinklers without triggering other code upgrades.",

From the late 1700's to the mid 1800's, the English murdered, starved and drove tens of thousands of Scots and Irish off their lands. In Scotland, it was called 'the clearances'. What it really was, was genocide, the kind only 'Great' Britain could do best.\n\nMany of those emigres came to Canada - hungry, exhausted, sick, penniless, in great need. In Canada, especially in Hamilton and other areas of South West Ontario, those immigrants (who did NOT have an application pending) were sheltered, fed, healed and merged into our society. Today they make up an important back bone of the Canadian mosaic. If you have any doubts about the loyalty or gratitude they felt then all you have to do is research the history of the Irish and Scots guards in the first and second world wars. \nThose immigrants did not fare as well in the US.

This scares the \"whatever\" out of the self-interest intransigent, the intrinsically faithless Managers and the uber-conservative. \nThere is also the pastoral pessimist elite who sincerely believe that men are intrinsically evil, women are worse and that humanity is doomed unless controlled and led - by them. \nOne can sense the church has withdrawn - retreated - from the formation of the faithful to the formation of clergy in the west. A real sign of having given up, they can't handle reason/fact, person, change/evolution.",

So I can understand the cries to have him removed from office.  But, I do applaud Trudeau's appointment of him as defense Minister.  Sajjan seems both smart and intelligent - and with a presence needed for his job.   I feel he brings some credibility (except for the Afghan incident)  to an important job both here and in our international dealings.   So Mr. Trudeau needs to find some sort of credible middle ground, if indeed that is possible at this point.   I do believe that the PM needs to speak out on his Minister's lies/indiscretions but to not go so far as to accept his dismissal - either as a resignation, or as called for by Cabinet.  At least not yet.  Sajjan can still become a useful asset, but only at this stage if the PM makes that point abundantly clear.",

Because of these dependencies, it cannot pursue an independent foreign policy, including foreign economic policy. The population benefits from some handouts, and perhaps for that reason this population has developed very few real capabilities. \n\n\" Iran is a different kettle of fish; entirely. It is arguably a modern nation state, with a reasonably educated and capable population which has shown great resilience in adversity, and a political system that is nearest to that of a democratic state in the whole of Middle East. Furthermore, it is independent in its security and economic policies. \"",

(you cannot call people like Stalin 'leftist' and remain in realityland, he usurped the true left communists of Lenin and Trotsky and established a dictatorship, a 'leftist dictatorship' is as much a contradiction in terms as a 'capitalist democracy', when money rules, you don't have 'democracy). Anyway, following logical thought, it is 'the right' which needs to control free thought and speech, and 'the left' which encourages, indeed requires, free, engaged, intelligent debate. It's a long story, more detail here - It's not 'the left' trying to take over the world and shut down free speech and all that other bad stuff - it's 'the right'!!  http://tinyurl.com/h4h2kay",

Jesus gives us a very clear picture of unworthiness when he speaks of the Pharisee vocally congratulating himself on his self perceived \"worthiness\" versus the humble sinner who knows his \"unworthiness\".  Might St. Paul's words be a reflection of Jesus teaching?  Isn't it just possible that St. Paul is in fact reminding us that the truly \"unworthy\" are those that are self justified in their false sense of piety?  Which leads me back to my initial point.  Maybe if we have a Eucharistic celebration where all are humbly invited forward to participate in communion with Jesus, starting with those that feel and know they are the most broken, we would be more faithful to the radical teaching of Jesus that all are welcome at his table.",

Voters are notoriously ignorant about even the basic fundamentals of policy -- even policies they support or oppose passionately.  This is bizarre behavior.  To even BE passionate about an issue implies that you're motivated to learn more about it, but this doesn't seem to be the case with voters.  Elections create a bizarre form of passion and emotion that does not lead to greater information and education on the issues.  In fact, I would argue that most political campaigns actively discourage intellectual thinking and real political education, because if voters were informed then most politicians probably would not get elected.  Some people think it's funny but there is a very good reason why politicians speak at a 7th-9th grade level, because that's what American voters are capable of understanding.

When you understand where, when and to whom she said that, it is perfectly normal and makes complete sense, and it's how every law is passed. She made that statement to a national conference of county officials, and it was in the midst of the very public debate and negotiations over what would be in the final bill. She told the county officials that Congress had to pass the bill before THEY (the county officials) could find out what would be in the final bill. That's how everything works. \n\nShe was NOT saying to lawmakers that they couldn't read the bill or find out what was in it unless they voted on it first. See, this is one of the best examples of how Republicans consistently lie. Lawmakers and the public had full access to the bill but it's not \"final\" it's passed",

The above program will fail because it is not true to the GBI concept.  In that concept, all adults get a GBI.  It should be none taxable, in other words cash in pocket. The above program does not test this.  The funding for this comes from many different sources but in general it is a reduction in government, not an increase in taxes.  Many welfare and social assistance programs can be reduced or even eliminated for significant savings.  The above program does not test this.

Now all we have to do is find a party with the cojones to do it.\n\nNDP, are you listening?",

The reason the Liberals changed the policy to create a 'capability' gap was to delay the inevitable decision to procure the F-35A and keep their election promise of buying the F-18 Advanced Super Hornet. By buying the 18 ASH they are either spending money recklessly (in the case of another aircraft being chosen) or have 'fixed' the process to have a pre-determined outcome (a full ASH fleet). Thing is the ASH is a prototype at the moment and it will take years to get it to full rate production. Most likely into the same time frame as the block 4 F-35. The projected fly-away costs of both will be very close by then.  And assuming the F-35's 'defects' have been corrected it will be a superior aircraft in just about every category. The ASH won't be a slouch though. The U.S. plans to use them with the F-35.",

If the victim would want him to be spared execution, I suppose that is the way it could go.  There is a caveat in all this however. Life without parole carries a cost borne by the state.

More so for low taxation places like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  Economic geniuses like Trudeau, Wynne and Notley are going in the other direction. It boggles the mind...",

What Canada really needs is to strike a sane balance between the hard nosed environmentalists and the oil & gas industry. Those arguing that wind and solar are too expensive and not technologically viable haven't done their homework. PPAs locked in for 25 to 30 years are being signed today for less than $0.03 per kWh. Have a look at your power bill and see what conventional technologies are costing you. That doesn't mean we can easily go to 100% renewables (there are real challenges to manage intermittent sources) but going from 1.5% to 30%-40% can be done extremely economically even considering no additional technological improvements. On the transportation side, reducing emissions is even easier. Many of the largest auto makers no longer believe they will manufacture combustion engines for light vehicles after 2025.

First, people can haggle away about the definition of \"child soldier\", but it is clear that he was a child being manipulated by a wacko father and his equally wacko pals.  This seems to have started when he was 8 or 9, and intensified at age 11.  Secondly, there is no real evidence that he threw a grenade that killed anyone.  The first version of the American battle report says that whomever threw the grenade was killed on the spot.  It was altered three months later to say the grenade thrower was \"engaged\" by American troops.  Khadr was found badly wounded, unarmed and under a pile of rubble.  He ought to have been brought back from Gitmo as soon as possible, but three consecutive Canadian governments failed to do that.  According to the SCoC, we ignored our legal obligations to a citizen -- and a child, at that.  This is what happens when a government chooses to ignore its own law -- and rightly so.",

Every time Christians or westerners are killed by the Sunni Terrorists there is no reaction from the Muslim Community. So silence means they not only condone but support these actions.

Private schools simply concentrate those with similar backgrounds in one location. They take no money from the system, continue to support the public system, and end up often as not socializing with those not in private schools , as not everyone attend these schools .

By moving operations to the American south, BC forest companies are able to avoid tariffs and duties, operate their mills at far higher margins and obtain ready supplies of timber from both public and private sources. The days of using these companies as instruments of social policy are over given that the provincial government's power to reduce allowable cuts is now academic. By ignoring the advice of the industry at the outset of the beetle plague, the NDP doomed the BC forests and precipitated the move southward of it's industry's capital.. The tariffs and duties are simply the coup de grace.",

It seems to me that someone who touts her military credentials (a military lawyer, not a combat vet) would read Defense News, which reports that the Senate, like the Americans they represent, are divided on the question of war.  Senator Graham has drafted a broad AUMF.  A bipartisan bill, similar to what the President asked for, would authorize action for only three years, and only to protect Americans under imminent threat.  Democrat Bill Menendez, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would bar ground troops, which the President also proposes.  Others are looking for a coherent strategy against ISIS before voting to authorize an AUMF.  But if you really want to talk about supporting the troops, then talk about the President's repeated statements that we don't have combat troops in the Middle East, that they're just \"advisors\".

Neither did she feel the need to advocate for centralized power or 28 fundamental beliefs. None of the founders were interested in such things. What I'm saying is that we stop tweaking it and go back to the basics. We keep tweaking and tweaking and tweaking, stop trying to get people to be more right and more holy.

But, primarily, I think, people have been ingesting broadcast (passive) media (and trained to be passive in schools/at work) for their entire lives, so they have become adept media consumers but poor media producers with surprisingly low media literacy (even though media makes up the bulk of their environment and experiences). ... In opposite to your point, I think the expression of diversified opinions actually is very high now worldwide, with social media/blogs/WordPress, etc., (everyone has an opinion; yet the channels with the biggest resources and biggest audiences gather virtually all of the eyeballs and ears, so the real impact of that diversity is very low). 1/2",

I don't think Jesus, as God, had to go along with anything that an ostensible series of prophets just made up.\nThe way you describe sin sounds like it is simply part of our biology rather than a \"nature\" that is reduced (fallen) through sin.  In such a case, Jesus might as well have come to free us from \"opposable thumbs\" as from \"sin\".\nI think that finding uniformity of thought among our Jewish brothers is as difficult as it is among Catholics.

But there remains this persistent tradition visible within the gospels in which both men are followed by militants, both men die accused of or associated with rebellion, and both men remain more or less enigmatic figures for at least several centuries.\n\nPlease understand: I am not prepared to argue that Jesus was, in fact, a Zealot or something of the kind. The Synoptic evangelists (especially Matthew) would have had a vested interest in portraying Jesus as having fulfilled the requirements for a Messiah, and would have had to walk a fine line between myth and reality.\n\nI apologize.

The AGDC $3 million per month is paying the bloated saleries of AGDC officials and funding the very expensive filing with the FERC to push forward the EIS - environmental impact statement.  With an EIS approval in hand AGDC can tell the world it has a viable project so if someone wants to lend us $40 billion or commit to buy LNG well above todays market price we are ready to go.  Note that in a recent speech to the Resource Development Council Walker pointed out that HE did not authorize any funding to AGDC that was the previous Administration.  So he can go into the 2018 Governors election saying I never funded AGDC, its not my fault that it wasted hundreds of millions.  But we all know Governor Ahab has been chasing this white whale for the past 20 years.  His finger prints are all over it.",

It clearly expresses Catholic doctrine that Mass is a Sacrifice. (Novus Ordo prayers were watered down to make it palatable to Protestants). The folks who attend tend to take their Catholic faith seriously (as do a minority at the NO). The music isn't the same lame GIA songs but draws from our rich musical patrimony. I've been to the Ordinariate Mass, they wonderful...I wouldn't go to an Episcopal Mass, I'm not Episcopalian, and they don't have the Real Presence (yet they kneel to receive Communion).

See my other post as to why many areas restrict harvest to full-curl rams. \"Any sheep,\" \"any ram,\" and \"any ram with at least 3/4 or 7/8 curl\" hunts used to be more common in Alaska, but now most areas restrict harvests to full-curl rams. Hunting needs to be limited for several reasons, primarily because it is popular (i.e., many hunters apply for permits), nobody wants to see too many hunters chasing a small number of legal sheep, and because sheep hunters (and sheep watchers) would like to see more sheep in the mountains, not less. We used to have hunts specifically for ewes in the Chugach Mountains, but they had to be suspended about 10 years ago because the number of sheep started to decline precipitously.  Not because of the hunting, but for the reasons mentioned in the article. No one hunts ewes for their horns. Finally, most sheep hunters are not wealthy. The local Dena'ina prized sheep meat and subsistence hunting is still practiced in Alaska.",

On average black people, who comprise just more than 10% of the population, whose drug use is half that of whites, are arrested three times as often on drug charges as whites. So, the higher rate of drug use in the Caucasian population that outnumbers the minority population by almost ten to one, means that black people are arrested on drug charges at a rate of 20 times that of white people for the same offense.

The tradewind inversion is usually capped at 9,000ft on Mauna Kea. 80-200inches of rain occurs per year below that line throughout different broad areas on Hawaii Island. This is where the aquifer recharge occurs, not the summit of Mauna Kea. 10-20 in. of rain is what typically occurs above 9000ft. In Dr. Thomas's studies, the age of the water in the aquifer is ~9,500 years old. It will take thousands of years (and major filtering and chemical interactions) as the water moves down to ~3,000ft on Big Island toward the aquifer if it ever makes it down from the summit.

The building of the Trojan Court money pit is just one example of a colossal waste of the taxpayers' money which sucks thousands from the budget daily.   Classified workers are grossly underpaid while administrators waste money, continually go over budget on building projects, and do little work.  Board meetings are catered affairs while instructors and classified staff have limited resources.  If this was a private business it would have bankrupted years ago.  Wake up taxpayers.

I've found teachers to be similar any other professional employee group with values, opinions and attitudes that differ throughout buildings and districts. Teachers experience first hand the societal problems families are faced with on a daily basis. They also differ on solutions to those problems. Attempting to influence legislators on viable solutions are not unanimously agreed to by all public employees. Under the current system, just talking with legislators doesn't seem to work does it?  Continuing the same system over and over and expecting different results is one of the definitions of insanity. How many times are voters going to buy that tax cuts for the rich don't result in significant jobs being created? Teachers are too busy each day with our children to ignore any attempt to modify some of the laws.",

I hated my Toronto home buying experience, where mysterious last minute bidders (who were nowhere to be seen) submitted bids that I had to match or exceed based only on the suggestion of my agent - who only had more to gain from it.   I think we should adopt the Australian approach, and make each home sale a public and open auction.    No more manipulation by the agents.   Public, open, accountable and transparent.   That will make the madness stop, and cut prices by removing the parasitic agents.",

It is one thing to say, “I had an interesting dream last night.” However, it is quite another matter to say, “God gave me a dream last night, and you must obey it.”\n\nHowever, I meant to ask how you understood Revelation 12:17 and 19:10, in which it states: \"For the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy.\"?",

We have to be \"awake\" to acknowledge the stirrings of the Spirit within us and around us, and being focused on spiritual practices of various kinds can put us in the spiritual arena.  Perhaps even the \"lower level\", merit-making schemes could keep us engaged long enough to hear the voice of the Spirit calling us to other levels of spiritual awareness and a more mature faith.  I suspect that some people fall asleep spiritually and are not engaged enough to allow themselves to receive new insights.  The problem is remaining at the merit-making beginning of the journey, not the fact that we were once motivated by the merit-making.",

Have you ever looked into the components of the price of gas? Approximately one-third goes to governments, which would more than pay for all the roads in Canada.  The problem is that governments take much of the gas tax money and spend it elsewhere.\n\nAs for private-provision of public transit, the experience is indeed mixed, but we have little experience with it in Canada. The main reason is that the powerful public sector unions (think TTC ticket sellers making over $100,000 a year) will never let politicians experiment with private-sector alternatives",

Having worked in tech all my life, the manufacturing operators and such who comprise so many of the tech workers tend to earn about 15-20/hour, far less than 105K/year.  It may be that the average tech salary is inflated by the incomes of the extremely rich company owners.

Not likely they would fess up that they are the reason why a property in that neighborhood is now over a million.  Anyone doubt me?  Look around in neighborhoods like Hawaii Kai, Kahala, and Kailua.  Notice the mismatch between properties on a given street.  I see modest houses that look like they were there since the 1960's.  Those are the original owners.  Then I see architectural monstrocities complete with electric gates in front of the property.  I also highly doubt such monstrocities would be rented to residents or sold for an affordable price.",

However given the Speaker is from the NDP/Greens their impartiality may be called in to question.

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

The last act I took as an MP in 1988 was to get agreement for the Health and Welfare Committee to study financing Medicare in the 21st century. The report was long and thoughtful; but led to no major change.\n\nOur current Medicare system is not serving us well. At least, the current government's proposals to devote more to home health care and mental health care are promising initiatives. But, my experience in Parliament as well as long service on a large hospital board have led me to conclude that our healthcare system needs to be reformed. Increasing the roles of highly trained nurse practitioners to ease the financial costs should be brought in.  \n\nThe solution is not just to \"throw more money\" at the current system; it is to restructure the system to do more with comparable money.",

And great crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.\"\n[Mt. 4:23-26; Mk. 1:35-39; Lk. 4:44; 6:17-19].\n\nEnumerate where Cupich 'continues to show weak tendencies.'",

I'm not sure how progressives challenge such a world-view since their particular nemeses seem to be Jewish establishment conservatives - people like William Kristol and Leon Wieseltier come to mind.

Furthermore, proof of biblical accounts are currently being scientifically proven. Likewise, prophesy has repeatedly been accurate. Interesting how this information is not in the basket of science curriculum and factored into questions man wishes to answer. Granted God does require a certain amount of faith from His believers. It is this aspect of faith that builds a personal and trusting relationship with God. Fortunately, God does not leave believers with no evidence of their faith though.

WISC is the testing application to get an idea about the learning disabilities by someone trained in the testing using WISC ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children).

First they lose their sense of security along with the use of what was stolen from them and then, if they were fortunate enough to have insurance on it, the insurance company depreciates the value of it before paying a claim. The victim has to pay the policy deductible and then accept whatever they can get from the insurance claim. In some cases the stolen items are irreplaceable. As insurance claims rise, so do premiums. And when property crime becomes a regular problem, then concentrated crime neighborhoods get a reputation. Property values drop as a result.  \nWe don't save anything by not incarcerating criminals.

Are we really to believe that the state paid $900 million in credits? I think someone is fudging some numbers here or something. Maybe considering only unrestricted revenue or something?\n\nGranted, this is a lot less than the state collected in the past from the oil and gas industry.\n\nI wonder why the state doesn't make a deal with the oil companies to pay taxes in advance on the gas line in exchange for a long term slightly reduced rate.

He banned Syrian refugees long before 45's travel ban. 45's toothless 'religious freedom' executive order is law in Indiana; mandatory minimum sentences are also law; sessions just reinstated this system of sentencing, which takes discretion out of the hands of judges, and which of course affects black and brown people more than any other group. pence coauthoured a bill to defund Planned Parenthood 7 years ago; and while 45 thinks its OK to grab women by their x pence has actually tried to redefine rape as 'forcible rape', not unlike todd akin's odious 'legitimate rape' comment.

So it is one big charade. The excellent bond rating is partly because cash is sitting in the bank instead of being spent on needed infrastructure improvements and City provided services. Shall we discuss categorically all services that the City is responsible for and if money is needed to fund say HPD, senior housing and related services, public transportation (excluding the rail) etc. Taxpayers are tired of hearing rhetoric and half truths by politicians.

Even money in a savings account finds it's way into the economic stream; to the little guy\nI believe socialism occurs when you factor personal responsibility out of the equation and end up with a large portion of the population that feels entitled to a standard of living that they have not earned or that it is society's responsibility to take care of bad personal decisions such as having kids you are not prepared to take care of.

The Portland Thorn see the most attendance in the NWSL, and get 15K a game, and the league average is just under the League 2 average.  The NWSL should be able to match that pay level, no?

If Comey had found criminal activity and if the Attorney General had declined to press charges, that would have been questionable, but that didn't happen.\n\nBut a I said, this is nothing but a smokescreen to deflect attention from the expanding Trump mess.

The University of Texas System has a $16.9 billion operating budget. Texas has a population of $25.1 million and 213,000 students in the system.  This works out to $673 per resident and a whopping $79,000 per student.  The UA system has an operating budget of $335 million. Alaska has a population of 737,000 and 34,000 students. This works out to $454 per resident and a miniscule $9,900 per student. Meanwhile the UA endowment is around $200 million ($271 per resident), while the UT endowment is $24.1 billion ($960 per resident).  The resident cost of attendance at UT is $26k/yr while the cost at UAA is $21k.  Given these numbers, I would conclude that UA has been extremely efficient with its comparatively small budget.

Specifically:\n\n• People age 16 to 17, who likely are in high school: 9 million\n\n• People who are enrolled in either two- or four-year colleges: 21 million\n\n• People age 65 and older, who have reached retirement age: 40 million people\n\nThat means 20 million people are of normal working age, not in college and not working.\"\n\nThey rate this claim Mostly False, but Paul Jenkins, who always complains about media bias, pushes it anyways.",

A two-state solution seems the most likely way to achieve that since Israelis are so set on the idea of an ethnic and religious homeland being a rigth, they must then offer Palestinians the same right.\n\nOne the other hand rightwing thought consists of \"Israel good, Muslims evil\".\nAnd hence peace becomes impossible because that section of Israel which is racist and hateful has the entire global rightwing on their side.

The county is very picky (rightfully so) about who they hire for this job - far more selective than the city or state.\n\nSecond, the county didn't give away the forest work camp.  They rented it to the veterans group for a very nominal amount, this is true.  But the group is taking over all maintenance of the site, which was costing the county hundreds of thousands in tax dollars per year.  This decision was made after they tried and failed to sell the land, so I would say it's a frugal decision based on their limited options.\n\nIf you want to talk about government officials building facilities then not funding them, look to the state-run Junction City hospital.",

There are \"stately\" homes from the 1920's that grace streets next to other types of housing units.\nThe low income housing is built across the street from three schools and the recreation center. It is very well maintained with beautiful landscaping and if you didn't know it was for low income you would think it was a middle income apartment complex. Part of the \"mix\" of neighborhoods is due in part to the low income housing's voucher program that allows folks to rent anywhere the landlord will participate. \nWe have the Pioneer Home across the street from a complex for low income seniors or disabled that is maintained wonderfully. It is next to a very nice Best Western Hotel. \nOutside the city things are a mix too.",

While I receive the PFD there are no others in my house to receive it. I do not know what you are inferring about me enjoying a prospective ride on a gravy train. But it sounds a bit insulting. The cost of living in Alaska is about to go up with taxes and a reduction in the PFD. With cut backs it is likely that home values will go down. And you might not be aware that the tax code will not tax me for the gain in my house so that is a factor in deciding to move and not , as you claim, a reason for staying.

He was a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996. He was a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004, during which time he taught three courses per year. Senior Lecturers are considered to be members of the Law School faculty and are regarded as professors, although not full-time or tenure-track. The title of Senior Lecturer is distinct from the title of Lecturer, which signifies adjunct status. Like Obama, each of the Law School’s Senior Lecturers have high-demand careers in politics or public service, which prevent full-time teaching. Several times during his 12 years as a professor in the Law School, Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full-time tenure-track position, but he declined",

I do think, though, that he, such an admirer of Aristotle for not only his logic, but also his early pursuit of science, would take into consideration all valid scientific discoveries in the intervening centuries.  That would include not only human reproduction, but valid sociology and, perhaps, a realization that his own view of women would have been as affected by his own unbelievably social status conscious and cruel mother just as much as witnessing his sister's death by lightning afflicted him with such a paralyzing PTS phobia of thunderstorms.\n\nAlthough a liberal, I not only like him, but would love to meet him.",
