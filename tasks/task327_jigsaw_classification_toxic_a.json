Even if your fantasy story is true about King, its not relevant to his achievements. The confederate traitors' statues are literally trying to rewrite history.\n\nBasically, you are a racist who thinks that if a black guy does something bad, that makes it OK for Roy Moore to be a pedophile.",

Mexico, with a population of about 122 million, is second on the list, with 247.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign, which advocates for the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals, logged 326 murders of LGBT people in 2014.\n\nThe NGO Grupo Gay de Bahia says 1,600 LGBT people have been murdered in Brazil since 2011.\"\"\"",

We have no revolution to glorify, and we have never had conflict on our own soil except as a colony.  Illustrious tales are few, we slogged our way into nationhood, and the first seeds were sown not by us but by Britain in 1867.  WWI proved we could stand on our own.\n\nAs an aside, I am saddened by Wilson-Raybould 's remark that it is “hard to celebrate 150 years of colonialism.”  Aboriginals got a raw deal, true enough, but even though our history has its share of lamentable events, we have also done much to be proud of.

It all seemed to work so well. \n\nBut then everything changed when President P*ssy-Grabber got himself elected with Vladimir Putin's help. Riding the coattails of white nationalists, the new president unleashed the dark forces of hate that had been seething beneath the surface for eight years while President Blackface was in office. Now we live in a country in which Republicans are supposed to side with law enforcement (read: whites) against the black thugs championed by Democrats - at least, that's the narrative Republicans want you to believe. \n\nBut when genuine racial injustice rears its ugly head, what do the bishops do?

How many give a flying fig about Chapter 8?

The welfare programs, socialized health, the legislation that makes health insurance not only needed to afford health care but also mandated. All these things that make the haves share with the have nots. The police state, where cops look more like urban soldiers. The vast amount of state sponsored propoganda to make you think it's all okay. The lack of property rights, up to and including what you choose to posess and consume. The control our government has over us, is the very definition of communism. Both parties praise states rights, unless it's something they don't like.

Mrs. Clinton also botched her \"re-start\" with Russia, handing the foreign minister a mistranslated \"restart\" button. Russia has resumed its aggressive posture (Ukraine, Crimea), knowing it was amateur hour at the US State Department. And her lies about Benghazi are a disgrace; she was AWOL during the 3 am phone call. Mrs. Clinton is guilty of felonies for storing classified information on a non-secure, non-government server.

Planned Parenthood doesn't have such a \"policy\" because the impetus for that organization to provide reproductive services to women comes from the women themselves, that is, if women stopped seeking abortion services, Planned Parenthood would not employ physicians to perform abortions.

It's not diabolical, it's called supply and demand.\nWord association is a technique used in psychiatry, which you might need, but it is not a very useful game to engage in while talking about serious subjects. Abortion and slavery don't really have anything to do with one another.\nThe Centers of Disease Control and Prevention does not list abortion as a cause of death for the same reason they don't track miscarriages.

So by your reasoning, every US citizen is twice as violent as the guy you cite with a Spanish name. Why should Oregon pay to hold people with Spanish names for the convenience of ICE?

In another letter on this same subject someone suggested that Oregon switch to returning containers by weight instead of individual containers.  Once my wife and I adjusted to the change in Hawaii, we found this very convenient since we had to return containers to recycling centers there.\n\nHere's my point, while Oregon's bottle bill was a brilliant idea and legislation, it is now outdated.  There are a lot of things that can be improved to make it more fair (Who gets the money go?), easier to return containers, and increasing the types of containers that are returnable.",

You are welcome to believe all the boogeyman stories you want about how allowing people to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity will lead to swarms of sexual assault, but that doesn't mean anyone who disagrees with you is anti-women. Notice several other organizations took stands against the \"bathroom\" bill (which did a lot more than ban people from bathrooms). Second, exactly zero major sports leagues in America are intergender, so bashing one executive for that is a bit silly. I think most people agree basketball is a sport that would extremely difficult for women and men to play in the same league, simply because men are bigger and stronger.

I think this area is now over hunted and the 40 bull limit has pretty much devastated the herd in the area of Granite and McCumber Creeks.  This was supposed to have been a walk in hunt.

Had the million been selected, and arrived over 10 years, there would have been far less of a problem.. By contrast, Canada is taking 300,00 per year, but they are selected and Canada has developed an integration system and culture.",

In 1857, Taney penned the majority opinion (7-2) in the Dredd Scott case. The ruling is today assailed as one of the worst (long line mind you depending on your political views) cases by SCOTUS. \n\nAt the time of the case, Taney was 80 years old. He was born in 1777 near present day Baltimore. He inherited slaves from his father's estate.  Several history sites noted that Taney manumitted or freed them. Taney was also the first Catholic to be appointed to SCOTUS.  Taney was a Democrat.  He was the U.S. Attorney General in Andrew Jackson's administration. \n\n160 years ago, an 80-year-old SCOTUS Chief Justice, born in the 18th Century, penned a majority opinion that was bad law. Today, his legacy is denigrated by Baltimore's Mayor and Civic leaders as just \"another racist, male Caucasian\" of history. History goes to the \"victors\".",

We were told that this (almost on a same scale of disruption) would take only 10 years to build. Well, guess what, as with the H1, the rail folks are learning some brutal truth, and that, in short, is that infrastructure projects on this scale is almost impossible to ram into a compressed timescale in Hawaii. \n\nThe rail will be built - no doubt about it, but for the folks in town, Kakaako and UH - your train has just been delayed because the City tried to rush this project, with the results now showing up in today's hearing.",

Are you also implying that in 1972 due to the Trump family's political machinations he was reclassifed as 4-F (not qualified for military service)?

Went to the doc.  They did one of those pin prick tests.  Started taking shots.  Wasn't helping.  Talked to a friend who said it might be my diet.  Explained my diet...he suggested I quit dairy.  I did. Quit the shots. Haven't had allergies since. \n\nI had digestive issues and my doc wanted to put me on Prilosec for life (heartburn, what they called acid reflux).  They ran a bunch of tests and said I was just one of those people who would have issues.  Ran across an article that claimed if you didn't drink enough water, you might have digestive problems.  I checked my water intake and it was low, so I increased it. Fixed.\n\nDoc wanted to put me on cholesterol lowering medicine.  Changed my diet (went full Paleo..no grain, no legumes).  Cholesterol is fine.\n\nDoc won't even suggest prescriptions anymore 'cause he knows I don't buy into it.",

They never even gave estimates on how many lost healthcare due to the Affordable Health Care Act because their plans weren't up to the new regulations, the deductible so high as to be a terrible choice, etc., when the Act was put in force. Secondly, with the mandate removed, millions will choose not to have coverage, especially the young and healthy. The CBO past projections were so far off on costs and many areas, that Mr. Gardner is correct in dismissing their projections. \n\n\nMedicaid will be hard hit true enough. Sadly, the last recession has seen the rolls swell to unsustainable record levels. People went on disability and every government program available in the last 8 years under Mr. Obama. The work mandate is a great improvement if one can work while on Medicaid, but those who can still reject it, why? Maybe they're just riding the system if they can work and refuse to do so in my opinion",

There are a few people who still believe the money would go to schools but they also believe the sun revolves around the earth or that the Eugene city council and mayor are NOT incompetent. And Chris didn't anyone ever teach you about passing on false information?",

Good luck finding health care when the ACA dies. Good luck getting women's reproductive rights recognized when the Supreme Court overturns Roe V. Wade.\nHugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon",

To my experience, foreign owners also tend to make decisions that favour the parent over the branch plant in terms of innovation, sourcing of expertise and cost consolidation efforts.

In Canada we have adopted the idea that certain groups have rights so while we may not discriminate against someone because they belong to a group such as gays or natives we can abuse non members with impunity. In this case someone's right not to have hurt feelings trumps the individuals right to speak freely. The concept of the right to life , liberty and pursuit of happiness is inclusive while the right to sexuality is not and is more like a privilege granted by the king. Many people want to have their playgrounds off limits to others while being able to go and play wherever they want. When you involve yourself in society you invite society to be involved in your life. We cannot write and speak in public and not expect others to speak back and we should be happy to listen even if the words are critical. Shame on those who do not defend the right to speak freely even if the words are hurtful.",

After the deal is made, Weyerhaeuser says the price of lumber is down. The legislature passes TB21 (timber bill) giving the trees away free unless the price of lumber goes up to $73 per tree. Hidden in all this, are secret cash payments to the logging companies paying for saws, machinery, roads, and fuel. Weyerhaeuser is shipping out 500,ooo trees per day worth $20m daily, all the while poor mouthing what a losing deal Alaska gave them. Some in the  legislature wants to continue this system because they have jobs with Weyerhaeuser or are in their pockets. In this chaos, special interests bombard the people with false plans that demand taxes and using savings. Finally one day the trees are gone and so are the savings. Sound familiar??",

The early church no doubt prayed considerable before changing the day of worship to Sunday, and no doubt used this argument to affirm their decision must necessarily be right.\n\nAnd this is the basic spirituality of Rome. Namely, The Holy Spirit will not let us make a faulty decision and thus our church decisions are infallible. From there is is \"unity and surrender to church authority, or death.\"\n\nIn fact, they claim they did not change the day, Christ did, and they only carry out the will of Christ.

The political Lincoln tempered that view when he spoke to audiences in Northern Illinois.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation also showed Lincoln's political dexterity.  He used that decree to kept the French &\nBritish from recognizing the South.  But he only proscribed slavery where the Yanks did not have control.

[Compton and Berning. 2015]. It involved over 9,000 cases and controls spanning a 20-month period. It found that cannabis use while driving is not associated with increased crash risk once adjusted for confounding variables such as age, race, gender, and the presence of other drugs, including alcohol. Further, they found that cannabis did not add to the crash risk for drivers under the influence of alcohol. They did find that alcohol exponentially increased crash risk, double risk at 0.05% BrAC, 23 times risk at 0.20% BrAC. These results agree with an extensive 2013 review of 66 studies regarding crash risk and drug use which found that cannabis was associated with minor, but not statistically significant increased odds of injury or fatal accident.

Your mind already has an answer established so you are looking for proof that supports it, which is literally working backward in the scientific world.

The Parthian Empire was their equal, and it was a second tier empire in Asia).\n\nSecond, every country faces a population explosion when its death rates fall (due to medical advances) but its birth rates remain the same. When Europe went through a population explosion, more than half its people emigrated to the Americas. Indians and Chinese have not been allowed to send half their population to the Americas.\n\nToday, if everyone returned to their country of origin, then Ireland's population would go up by 500 percent.

You place the issue of pro-life as being morally equivalent to climate change or illegal immigration. In fact, you may even place less importance on pro-life issues than illegal immigration.

The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African Americans—both enslaved and free—to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.\"\n\nWhy do you find the idea that slaves were used to build much of the Capital to be some sort of disinformation?

Fabulous. When the trade flow stops let's just see how much the economy of all the border states suffers. Canada is the US' largest trading partner. We also count for the largest percentage of tourism dollars. Already that tide is turning, but a tax would cause a tsunami. And before you tell me how much we also need US trade - guess what?  We just signed a new trade deal with Europe and extending trade with China. We'll be fine.

The Church has a zero tolerance policy for priests who have committed no crime but want to marry – they have to be laicised and not just have some restrictions on their public ministry. As Commissioner Atkinson of the Royal Commission pointed out, one of the most hurtful things for victims is to find that abuser priests are not dismissed even if their public ministry is restricted.

No word at all [the presidential campaign as well] about how the human adventure is completely dependent on the natural world.  The first priority should be, what kind of an economy and culture can fit within the boundaries of the natural world. That's hard to define but its certainly very different from what we have now.  \n\nA dishonest, vanity based economy that externalizes its costs as normal business is not what we need.  An economy where millions of jobs exist to repair the damage caused by millions of other jobs is not what we need.  \n\nA repair economy is in order. Repair the built infrastructure [and quit building more that will require repair], address social/economic disequity, restore the environment.  Investing as individuals, communities and a nation in repair means we avoid creating an even bigger mess. A green economy based on fitting within the natural world looks far better than Trump or Clinton.",

A total of 45 brokers out of 4000 that marketed for Home Capital were suspended but the vast majority of mortgages underwritten for those brokers are sound.\n\nSecond, no \"funding model\" is diverse enough to prevent a run on the bank. Home Capital operates and complied with OSFI regulations, there is no suggestion that they violated those regulations which are some of the most conservative in the world.\n\nThird, it has yet to be determined whether their non prime mortgage book (which is performing with below-average delinquency) will be going anywhere but if it does, it has value. High ratio mortgages are still covered by CMHC and even if the real estate market declines substantially, mortgagors take the loss long before the underwriters.",

I actually think a bishops conference somewhere that starts the ball rolling on, for example, greater inclusion of lay people in actual governance, will provide some momentum that is now sadly lacking.  And might provide a blue-print for how to actually implement such a change - what do a bunch of celibate old men used to the Medieval power structures know about distributive power.  \n\nHope life settles down for you.

He has signaled early on USA should not spend resources and mind other country business, going into deeper military involvement will be the opposite of his 'America First' policy.  Besides the American public is still wary of the two wars started by George W. Bush.  So I think it is just a one off thing, not much after that.  BTW, Trump's idea of retreating from the World will be accompanied with diminished influence which is contradictory to the leverage he will need to 're-negotiate' whatever it is.

Many civil rights gains have been eroded (see Michelle Alexander's \"The New Jim Crow\"), but I fear that a Pence administration would take that even further.  \nAlthough I know there is not, I truly wish that there were some third alternative.",

Still nobody could give directions.\nBut i had an advantage, i could fly, flap my arms and up i would go. Eventually i got worn out because no one would give me directions.\nIn deep frustration i woke up.

So to call a political party \"pro\" abortion, is to distort a position.

The opposition intentionally increased the public frustration level and instead of compromise, they promulgated fear and resentment of the government among the people and the tactic seemed to be working. \n\nAll the while, the oligarchs never lost sight of their objective which is to extract maximum financial benefit from government and now have unlimited purchased speech to fuel the fires.

Because changing them would require a 60% majority vote that the Republicans don’t have. Perversely, Democrats have become the party of balanced budgets because of their Wall Street connections. Congress made the budget rules in 1984, in the wake of the Reagan tax cuts, specifically to constrain tax cutting.\n\nTrump wants to cut the corporate income tax rate by more than half, to 15%, and make that available to the half of all US businesses that are not in corporate form.\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/leesheppard/2016/11/13/trumps-tax-plan/#5a0fcf0d1110\n\nCorporate attorneys will definitely see a boom in their biz if this passes.
