To suggest that you can't find some gay men too fey, whilst thinking others are NOT too fey, means that you can not have taste or discernment, and that there is no room for individual character in gay men - IE, that there would be no gay men who could not be criticized for being too fey.\n\nDan Levy is trying to handicap the press and critics and free speech.

Actually he is one of the best people i have ever met, he was the only one who protected me from my extremly abusive boyfriend. \n     Joshua Wesley Sherman is my BEST FRIEND. Yeah, his record is bad also but the Lane County Legal system is cruel and unusual. Most everything they claim he did wasnt true. They just pinned him guilty by making it his only option.\n  They tell you the details they want to but they arent telling you EVERY DETAIL. Joshua wasnt present when the crime was commited he has an alibi but they silenced her. If the TRUTH came out maybe it wouldnt go unnoticed when the police do faulty ass shit.",

Trump is contemptuous of the Constitution, American values, and democratic government. The fact that this profoundly damaged man is president of the United States demeans the presidency and diminishes the country. However, Trump's presidency is far more than an embarrassment to the country; it is a clear and present threat to the peace and security of the country and of the world.

The structure of this tax is rational and productive. An important question is whether we are going to go on tolerating the erratic and wasteful tax structure we have now, where programs and departments ands agencies are slashed and then re-funded in ways that are wasteful and inefficient and lead to poor performance because revenues are so irregular.

In all those years, I have never heard anyone describe pidgin as broken or for the stupid.  I've known people who were fascinated and intrigued by it but never considered it broken or the people who spoke it stupid.  Using pidgin to communicate in certain circumstances and contexts is one thing.  Yes, there IS a time and place for it.  Teaching students to speak it in public schools?

Of course all that sexual energy is tied up into the exercise (sometimes brutal) of power and an affinity for raising large sums of money for their special projects.",

The baseless charge eventually ensnared Oscar Chapman, Interior secretary under President Truman, who Schoeppel accused of lying in his oath of office. Gruening and Chapman survived because they occupied positions of power, but, as Haycox notes, many others were not so lucky.

They cared that he was a good president who did a decent job and all he lied about was a blowjob - something he should NEVER have been ASKED about.\n\nJudging him while supporting a serial philanderer on his third marriage, who publicly boasts about sex acts WITHOUT consent, ogling young girls in their changing room,  cheating on all his spouses and lies every time he opens his mouth.

Only the strong survive, not only physically but mentally.  I think coaches need to back off and let the players play. Let the QB call the majority of plays. Let the defensive linebackers call the formations. Let the coaches run players in and out keeping them fresh. Once you can establish field position, then open things up and strike when odds are in your favor. Teams need more discipline including the coaches.

Into the 50s progressive was a synonym for communist, and a \"progressive person\" was a trusted fellow traveler but in a position where s/he couldn't be an open, card-carrying member of the Party.  Liberal became the substitute for use in polite company during the Cold War years until failed liberal policies made liberal a pejorative as well.   The government schools had done a good enough job of revising and air-brushing history that by the 90s it was felt safe to go back to the term progressive.

Reid has worked extremely hard to market the most ice time he can by instigating and running various youth and adult tournaments on a single rink that pack the place...something SMG would never attempt or pull off even at Anchorage facilities with double rinks, and gets several hockey camps to use its ice in summer.  When the ice is out for spring maintenance, there are car shows, etc.  The turf is used by baseball and soccer groups that were used to paying nothing to play outdoors...convincing them now to pay to play indoors isn't easy.  There is no way that changing management from FLAMI to SMG is going to improve visibility, use or attendance at the facility; I think it would make it much worse.",

A church that balances masculine and feminine energies would function like a healthy family with strong mother and father.

The meetings were held in the basement of a non- catholic church. No religion was involved. One day my mom told me that I was sinning and I had to stop the troop or I would be excommunicated at the age of 8 and go to hell. This was according to the Catholic Church. I never got over the unfairness of the Catholic Church bullying me as a small child. I quit the church when I turned 18 and so did all of the teens in my extensive family who were Catholic.

Then the house WILL be sold, and it won't sell at a peak price to a buyer limited by the monthly payment, as the payment will be higher with higher mtg rates. Unless the seller can find a richer buyer, they will lower the price if they want to sell.\n\nThe same thing that happened in 2006 is repeating. Prices are increasingly unreachable by someone making the median salary, and those that are buying must stretch more to close. Eventually there are no more than can do it. Introduce a recession and prices will gradually fall further as people lose jobs and then run out of savings or need to move. Incomes are fundamentally out of line with prices.",

Exxon refused to develop Pt. Thomson.  Alaska had to sue to get Exxon to honor its lease terms- and then Sullivan gave away Pt. Thomson.  Massive rip-off that has cost Alaska billions.  Of course Sullivan got rewarded for his sell out of Alaskans.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that ACES brought forward these kinds of developments- with the rich exploration credits.  This work began in 2008- under ACES.\n\nUnder SB-21, this find- if ever developed, could break Alaska.  We'd pay $8 dollars per barrel for \"new\" oil- cost us $8 to $16 million per day.",

I find that people of all political affiliations mostly want the same things, but vary significantly on how we can achieve those things for the most people.

Since there are many situations where we can all agree that a court must step in to protect a patient, we are stuck with courts being, potentially, involved in all kinds of medical decisions. In this particular case, Great Ormond Street (one of the best paediatric hospitals in the world) must feel very strongly that there is a clear case of excess suffering being imposed on a hopeless case for them to take the unusual step of asking to override the parents' wishes.

Unless you are willing to bury someone in jail for life, they are eventually going to get out. They have to have a reason to change. So with punishment, there needs to be hope.

However interestingly we rely on prior year's income (2016) reported by the taxpayer to qualify for APTC of upcoming year (2017).

Not lifting the writing instrument for each letter allowed the hand \"to run\" over the page.  Cursive handwriting became the standard form of  handwriting, and the only method taught, for many centuries.  Printing (the previously called \"lettering\" from centuries ago), was re-introduced into school curriculum around a century ago.   It was then that teachers first learned if you cannot write in cursive, you also are unable to read cursive writing. At that time the theory was that teaching printing would make learning cursive easier in grades two or three.  This was the process in North America for many decades.  Then those who developed curriculum decided it was WHAT students wrote that mattered, not HOW they wrote.  So today we again have students who are unable to read and write in cursive.

Such fund would be passive because it only buys and sells when the index components change. Given Berkshire's cash balance, however, it doesn't need to sell for this purpose nor to rebalance its portfolio. It is one of the most significant sellers of put options, which is definitely not passive.

Our 43% decline in cycling coupled with declines of over 50% in riding the bus and about 30% in walking (data from the US Census American Community Survey) means that we have over 9000 more cars on the road every single day in Eugene than we would have had without this failure.

In order to be effective, you must have long term care to ensure that proper medication and dosage are given. It can't be done in three day visit. Or four...or even a week. Borderline mentally ill....maybe but those who really need help, need long term care. DOC Alaska dwarfed API on that score and that is the sadness of the situation, that you must be an inmate to get long term mental health care because there is no beds at API.......isn't this ironically wrong with this set up??",

It is also helpful to look at the spending of other Pacific Northwest states on a per capita basis: Washington spends $5,250, Oregon spends $8,288 and yet Alaska spends $18,643.  Meanwhile Lieutenant Governor claims we don’t have a bloated budget. The numbers clearly say otherwise. Alaska state government spends far too much money.  In his essay the Lieutenant Governor said, “We have worked hard to reduce inefficiency in government.”  Really? Again, the numbers say otherwise. The Lieutenant Governor is making the case that every state program is essential while proposing new ones. That is a politician's justification for new taxes.",

And it's only \"expensive finding a new tenant\" if the market conditions are such that people aren't renting in that area, or at all -- so again, yes: If I am the home owner, I'm considering what the market would bear in making that call.\n.\nFurther on the economics lessons, if I go to McDonald's, and then I go to Crow's Nest, I don't seem to find the same kind of people.

No matter how comfortable people are around bears, bears can be unpredictable and when one misjudges that and is not prepared for that they put their lives in danger in any bear encounter. Treadwell's 10 year summer living with the Coastal Brown Bears shows as one wildlife biologist stated just how these bears are really tolerant of humans. I know from spending time in Katmai as far back as the 1970's that our discussions on bear behavior was that when the bears were eating salmon that is what they are engaged in 100% since most bears are loners unless they have cubs, so they are into their annual socializing at the salmon streams. But finding a lone brownie or a mother with cubs is a different story and they are more protective and are more wary of humans. I do know from 10 years on Kodiak Island that sharing any area with a large population of bears a lot just increases the odds that you will have a direct encounter with a bear, you think? So be prepared.",

On the other hand I wanted the best for her, and she got it. One only thing that concerns me is that I own stock in two Native Corporations, I'm not sure if I can leave them to her since she was adopted by others and not legally my next of kin.  That was always the problem with Natives, our lands taken, so inheritance was always a meager thing to the next generation. It just seems like inheritance issues are never a consideration.

City Council allowed a thriving revitalized and compassionate space downtown to get ruined. You can't drag your feet on things and respond too late. There were two murders on 19th this year both by tweakers looking to steal. Maybe we need more marijuana shops instead and seeing how the city is dragging its feet on the buffer that is already happening.

Instead of wailing about what it costs the country when some union goes on strike - do the math. That cost - the total combined cost to the ENTIRE economy that their strike imposed, is the actual value of their labour TO the economy.\nNow subtract their actual wages from that cost - and if the difference is too large, you understand two things (1) why strikes are needed and (2) just how severe the theft of capitalism truly is.\n\nIt is impossible, through the mere withdrawel of labour, to cost the economy one cent more than the VALUE of your labour.",

But if you give all these parties larger pieces of the parliamentary pie, the easy math is the CPC would win substantially fewer seats even if they win plurality.\n\nThe reason the Libs ditched it is: they do not wan minority government power, they want majority power.  Just as the CPC would lose seats with proportional voting, the LIbs would also lose some to the NDP and Greens, increasing the risk they would only win only a minority of seats in any given election.\n\nI think it is a good thing that we stick with the existing system.

Sub surface rights are with the Regs by and large. Some of the tribes want to pursue federal help with land in trust for police and tribal courts- Alaska has lagged in helping solve those issues and a couple careful studies see trust land and federal self-determination law as a way to help villages. \nNot sure myself.

The party which wraps itself in the flag and whose members talk about patriotism as if their party alone loves this country and will fight to the death to defend it from all enemies is completely baffling to me now and apparently to Joe Scarborough as well.

Quite a few of our customers did not think, that after they converted their office space to an open concept office, it would be so loud and noisy.\n\nI think we can all agree that hard, flat, reflective, parallel surfaces, create poor room acoustics for any open office.\n\nAcoustic desk partitions can help, but nominally. Better acoustic ceiling tiles will help. Acoustic panels installed on the walls and ceiling can dampen the noise by 35% to 45%.\n\nAfter the room is quieter, you may still struggle with privacy issues, Sound masking can help with this.\n\nwww.TheQuietRoom.ca",

One justice asked the attorney representing the Colorado AG regarding the difference between the fixed 3.5% annual raise (aka COLA) for retirees and the core PERA benefit itself, since both were in statute.  The attorney stated that the AG office considered neither the COLA nor the PERA benefit itself to be contractual, but the base benefit was afforded more legal scrutiny.  Therefore, the inference was that the COLA was strictly a gratuity, but the base benefit was a non-contractual promise which would need strong compelling reasons to alter.  It will take another round through the courts to determine whether the base benefit is a contractual obligation.  The vast majority of PERA members and retirees are in the dark regarding this matter, and the PERA board and management would like to keep it that way.",

Now they have to answer to shareholders and divulge prior private financial information.  The emperor's clothes have been stripped off so to speak.  With losses revealed and likely survival based on government grants, we may be able to learn how flimsy UO endeavors are.  They may be able to survive if they strip away the big ticket salaries, but with a limited market, big time success is hard to imagine (unless they actually find useful cost effective diagnostic applications which are not already trumped by alternative technologies).  Based on the last several years losses, it looks like their investors are going to lose their shirts.  I wonder if their looking forward IPO disclosures were honest.",

It is not a sacrament and there is no such thing as it being sealed (obfuscated) so no one else will find out.  When will the Bishops begin to realize their own misbehavior claiming such a seal?

If we do wish to take the media to task, however, it's funny how they pick and choose what is or isn't part of the media, as witnessed by the sudden proliferation of the euphemism \"fake news\".",

About 170 exploration rigs are currently operating in Alberta (double the number of operating rigs at this time last year). Where the exploration rigs go the service rigs soon follow.\n\nA young woman just down the road from my place is raising goats. Initially she was selling the milk to a cheese manufacturer for feta and some milk went to the lactose intolerant market. She started selling the unwanted male kids and the old nannies into the halal meat market. That has turned out to be very profitable for her.

Some are looking for their passion in forms and traditions while others are seeking to recapture the original revolutionary spirit of the early Church. I'm skeptical that those two paths will ever merge.\n\nPope Francis seems convicted that the salvation of the Church lies in communion with the poor and that anything that gets in the way of that can be jettisoned. I think he's right. And the good news is that none of us needs to wait for somebody else, least of all the hierarchy, to take the lead.",

We can only expect her to completely ignore the advice of any panel that advises her to make changes she doesn't personally benefit from.  Christy has been bought and paid for long ago by the fossil fuel industry.  It's clearly a case of you oil my back and I'll oil yours.

Compensatory damages would be medical expenses and maybe lost wages if she missed any work. If she suffered permanent damage there could be damages for the disability\" is entirely inaccurate, as the majority of the damages, comprising a large payday being sought, would fall in to the category of emotional injury.",

Yes, I've been to OUIT.  It has ONE Tier 1 Canada Research Chair.  A medium-sized university like McMaster has over 30.  There is already a network of nuclear engineering studies between Western, McMaster and Waterloo. Windsor has an established program in automotive engineering. There was already an oversupply of education faculties in the province when OUIT's was established.  From Oshawa's perspective, it seems great to have a local university with its infrastructure and 1300+ well-paying faculty and admin. jobs, but from a provincial, fiscal perspective, the redundancy is very expensive.",

I bet it is getting sent out of state/country in those big containers by a professional crime ring!  FEDS have you investigated that?  If you happen to get a good deal on Craigslist, Facebook, or any of the local \"sell-it\" sites and the sellers look like crack heads......then you are just AS BAD a criminal as they are.",

So Gordon Pape crunched the numbers incorrectly.\n\nMost active mutual funds in Canada charge around 1% pre-tax for fees.  The average active ETF is around 0.65%.  Not that much of a difference.  Passive is a different story and tends to be less expensive.  In recent years, passive has worked well.

We have entered a disturbing age of self censorship, hate speech laws and false truisms and our Canadian news outlets seem to embrace them. When, in truth, they should be the ones questioning everything and the motivations of those who generated this unpleasant climate.

Third, either stop introducing legislation or resolve every bill by defeating it, passing it, combining it with similar legislation, or having it withdrawn by the sponsor.  Forth, elect the State Attorney General. Fifth, require all meetings with lobbyists to be placed on the public record and finally diminish the ability of the Governor to so strongly influence the redistricting process.

In addition, that same staff had bonded some of our PERS liability when interest rates were low and nearly fully funded our liability. \n\nThis higher level of funding directly impacts the rate that Lane County is charged to cover PERS expenses for our employees. While other public employers in Oregon, with less than 80 percent of their PERS liability funded, saw their rates raise by as much as 6 percentage points in FY 15- 16, Lane County experienced an increase of just 1.8 percentage points for the same time period.

Limited mobility and can't read the defense to switch out the protection is 70% of the problem. Siemian is a back up @ best!  I'd take the better option moving fwd period vs continuing to pretend we actually have a true starter on roster today.You have an aging supporting cast, soon the play makers on offense will age out.

The trick, Tesla thought, was to use the air of the upper atmosphere to transmit energy - over any distance, above or through the Earth, even to other planets. Power would be beamed to a terminal in the upper atmosphere, then transmitted to receivers on the ground or in the air. The risks were potentially high - 'So strangely do such powerful discharges behave,' he wrote in 1899, 'that I have often experienced a fear that the atmosphere might be ignited.' \"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science1",

In one, there is no drop in demand on Saturday and Sunday; in another, there is such a drop in three days out of seven.  In all, the morning peak in demand is often higher than the late afternoon peak, something rarely seen in South Africa.  They hope to balance things out with combined cycle gas turbines [CCGT] by 2020, but it is nearly 2018 and there is no sign of any gas, let alone any CCGT stations. Although the authors are German, they take no account of the German experience, which is having to build 19 new coal-fired power stations to balance their grid even though they have extensive interconnections to the rest of Europe.  We have no such level of connectedness. And Germany nearly lost control last winter when there was no wind for two weeks, and only great efforts by their neighbours saved them.

The ratification process was no slam dunk for the supporters of the Constitution, it almost failed.  Supporters of the Constitution were known as Federalists, non-supporters as Anti-Federalists.  Thanks to the anti-Federalists we had the first 10 amendments to the Constitution known as the Bill of Rights in 1791.  But, those first amendments actually started out as 12.  One of those 12 became part of the Constitution on 5 May 1992, as the 27th Amendment and believe it or not, one amendment is still pending before the states.",
