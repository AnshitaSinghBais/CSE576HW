The mythology of Southern White superiority was just that, a mythology built to support the slave-based economic imperative - not the other way around. The North was an industrial economy that had evolved to require free - or at least non-slave - labour, although indentured labour was accepted (Go figure. But after all, rember this is the time of Charles Dickens). Gizella is correct. Princess Alceste and the rest of the Greek Chorus Gals & Castratos are simply wrong.  The States War (Civil War) was, like most wars, was fought over economic imperatives. Slavery was very much a secondary, though critical aspect of the complex factors resulting in war.

This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.\n\nInterestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true. So I just want to apologize let u know that I understand now.I am sorry that you have to still encountr ignorance",

I realized that the Church was not a place I could any longer find peace and solace; too much ideological infighting, too much backbiting; too much clerical arrogance.\n\n3. The pedophilia scandal made me sick, literally sick. \n\n4. Finally, I don't believe most of the Church's theological teachings anymore: I do believe in a higher power, but I don't believe that a young rabbi in ancient Israel was the Son of God.\n\nSorry, friend.",

Not convinced to read after review as it seems to delve into a lot of theological hair splitting. The concept of the \"People of God\" like \"We the People\" sought to invest authority within the common good of the masses rather than a select few men at the top. It remains fiercely resisted by the few men at the top, in church and state. Obedience linguistically has origins in \"listening to.\" The collegial, democratic impulse is that servant-leaders listen to the people more than forcing the people to listen to them. The elites still distrust the masses to know what is good and good for them. Was it Freire who said not to capitulate \"that the masses are asses?\" Voices from below still struggle to have their voices heard. Paul VI's rejection of the birth control commission is currently exhibit A. The masses need to believe in their prophetic voice despite efforts from above to silence them.",

If he bothered to read the article instead of lying about it, here is a direct quote...\n\n\"About 40 percent of the children in the CONTROL group did not receive formal preschool services; the rest did, just not through Head Start.\"\n\nWhat do you need to know about head start to understand that this is a direct contradiction of Keolus lie?\n\nIOW since the head start group is over 300 and there 5000 in the study, about 2000 are kids who did not have preschool.

It would allow so much of the metro to gain easy access to transit less than a mile from their homes that is fast but also connects with the light rail boosting ridership and reducing traffic. To solve Denver's traffic problem successfully it will require big thinking across the whole metro. ALSO add high speed buses from castle rock along Sante Fe drive 85 to the Littleton light rail station which should extend to highlands ranch asap.

Many of them have only had 8 years of religious formation.\n\nThey come to teach in Catholic schools, right after college, to get a job---then move on to public schools to get more money [to pay off their bills].  They don't teach religion because they WANT to.  Our parish catechists ATTEND every course that the Diocese requires and more.  They read constantly [and I know what they are reading].  They choose to be catechists and to assist the youngsters in their religious formation, willingly.  And many stay on for years. \n \n More kids are in parish programs because families can't afford Catholic school tuition.",

The low voter turnout is a statewide phenomenon and not strictly limited to D-36.  \n\nI can speculate as to why the state has such a low turnout and it's most-likely attributable to a great lack of faith in candidates (a choice issue) and a corollary to our incredibly high cost of living (where voting is a luxury when you're not  grinding to make ends meet).  \n\nI believe Marilyn has a valid concern with Fukumoto's claim that her switching parties is motivated by 4% of the total number of voters that had cast their vote during the D-36 representative seat run-off.  \n\nAs a candidate, switching from Republican to Democrat - here in Hawai'i - means accessibility to union money and thus, a much larger campaign coffer.  Isn't that a major reason for the switch?  The feel good \"community wants it\" claim is just political double speak.",

Assad has done horribly evil things but when the alternative is ISIS, does it make sense for regime change? The Sunnis/Shias are engaged in multi-state sectarian war involving everything from ancient religious hostilities to natural gas pipelines. On the balance of probabilities, the House of Saud is arguably the best bad option. The article even notes that 5 armed militants were killed in the clash, should the Saudis just allow armed militants to operate in the country with impunity?

The dividend also is a contributor to  our balloon economy and disrupts  stable free market forces.",

That poll basically means we would like it to be finished, but we (the taxpayer) don't want to spend anymore money on it which basically means either the City and/or the State have to magically pull money out of thin air, or the project is going to stop when they run out of money.

This is why the current DC needs to be changed.  This game should not have been this close.  Thank goodness the Offense showed up after the 1st quarter and they were more disciplined which led to a lot less penalties.  I fear that if it's this hard to win against a team that has only one win so far this season and we lost to a team that had zero wins until they won against us last week, we won't win more than 1-2 more games.

Of course TARP should have put limits on executive compensation etc., but we had to compromise with Republicans to get it passed (it was, after all, President W's bill). And certainly the stimulus should have been bigger, with fewer tax breaks and greater direct spending, which would have gotten our economy moving much faster, much sooner, thus reducing the deficits.

Both grapes and cannabis produce an incredible range of flavours and are affected by their growing conditions. Compare canada's wine industry to californias. California produces hot climate wines like cabernets and chardoneys while Canada produces cool climate wines like Reisling and cab franc.

I can appreciate that. Face it, we've all suffered through horrendous masses with awful music, awful preaching, and awful liturgical manners on the part of everyone involved - at least, I have. I think many in the younger generation of traditionalists have simply never witnessed the new rite done well, with beauty and respect.

A health care system with such a basic premise at its center is destined to failure.  The ACA (Obamacare) was intended to provide a cure for that very \"ill\" healthcare system.  Unfortunately, with insurance companies and managed care corporations still at the center of the system, it seems to have only exacerbated the problems.  \n\nIn my opinion, until we adopt some form of single-payer healthcare system, these issues will persist.",

To the contrary, I find a remarkable coherence in the Pope’s central emphasis on the Lord’s “love and mercy” that is the singular most important key to his magisterium, Contrary to causing confusion and division, this is promoting a wide respect and love for Pope Francis in his commitment to accompany people at their starting point rather than discourage or marginalize the faithful. I believe Pope Francis has expressed enormous patience and restraint in not publicly admonishing the four cardinals who openly expressed their dissent in the “dubbia” that they chose to publish publicly. Synodality is the most ancient form of exercising authority in the Church in the first milennium. I see no evidence that pope has demeaned the importance of Church doctrine.

Legislators use an IRS loophole that gives them a choice of the state system, or getting per diem at the federal rate regardless of expenses.\n\nTo the person, they have opted for the federal rate because they make thousands- which they couldn't under the state system.\n\nAlso, as you know, they instituted this practice when their salaries were $24,000, they were blocked by public outcry from raising, AND the state was flush.

When it is a religious leader it has a particular damaging effect on the religious spirit of the person abused.  \n\n\"Language, power, and harm in clerical sexual misconduct\" talks about clerical sexual misconduct involving adults (CSMIA). and can be found here:  https://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=50509#.WKeJXXe-IdW.  \n\nSee comment 2",

No one with power in Israel is interested in a two-state solution; No one in Israel interested in a two-state solution is permitted to take power. The Obama administration's decision to refuse to use the US's Security Council veto was a signal to the world that the world no longer need play along with Israeli colonization of the West Bank.

There have been Religious people attempting to use science to say that life begins with conception, but what do they mean by life?  Two living cells come together with conception.  All liver cells, brain cells and even skin cells are living cells. They are alive!  Science has shown that all it takes is an evacuated ovum and a living skin cell to form a fetus.  Can scientists create a soul?  So no, it is not accepted by science or thinking people that personhood begins at conception.  By far more conceived embryos and fetuses are simply evacuated out of the uterus than ever attach.  Does God create all those souls to evacuated them and not allow growth and development?  Too many questions for you or any finite human to answer.  There is no common agreement about this issue as you seem to think!",

If there's any difference in premiums between sprinklered and sprinkerless highrises, that difference would be an objective measure of how much value professional actuaries place on sprinklers.  \n\nInsurance companies put their money where their mouth is.  They study how much was actually paid for property damage and loss of life, and adjust the premiums accordingly for future years.  I'll bet there's no difference.  Or if there is any difference in fire insurance premiums, compare the total difference in premiums over 30 years against the cost of retrofitting.  \n\nThen there's the cost of moving out people and their furniture to let sprinkler pipes be installed.

Just because we cannot confirm the existence of God/gods does not mean He/they don't exist, nor would science make such a claim.  Science hypothesized the existence of the atom and quarks before we could discern their imprint on reality.  So, despite having no meaningful sense in which they can be said to exist, science did not deny their existence, it simply did not confirm it.  So too, with God/gods.

Statistical statements about populations cannot prove anything about individuals, nor can a fact about an individual prove anything about a population. Marie Henein is an accomplished litigator. That does not disprove the assertion that female lawyers are less inclined to become litigators than male lawyers. By the same token, the fact that female lawyers are less inclined to become litigators than male lawyers does not prove that Marie Henein, or any other female lawyer, is disinclined, or unsuited, to be a litigator.\nIn the same way, that women are less inclined to go into computer science does not prove that all women, or any particular woman, are unsuited to be software engineers.

Sorry, my good man, truth comes to us finite humans in bits and pieces and we must always continue to assimilate it to grow and develop in the grace of the Spirit.

I would have thought that Oliver of all people would have mentioned the fact that many (most?) parents don't, can't cook family meals anymore.

This should be listed. If someone had a $3500 net for the month with $800 removed, it would help them see what they are actually paying. The notion that the employer pays is misleading.\nAlso, the govt. has struck this deal to say it won't tax benefits.

Been following on Travel Guide Book and explore.org bear cam threads where many have expressed concern regarding the proposed schedule for the beginning phase of this bridge construction that could result in the starvation and death of many of the bears people have come to love. As the contract has already been awarded sadly it's a done deal we had no say in. Former Katmai National Park Ranger Mike Fitz who cataloged the 'Bears of Brooks River' for the NPS has asked that the construction start be changed so the bears can eat and fatten before winter. The current work schedule allows staging and work to begin when bears need Brooks River access the most. This is not acceptable. His points and concerns are valid and he has asked everyone to contact Superintendent Sturm in Katmai National Park and Preserve as the bears well being should come before anything else.  https://fitznaturalist.com/2016/12/03/brooks-river-bears-need-your-help/",

As such, we are headed SOON to a time when we must give up all of our water, and NONE of our federal CONgress critters are doing a single thing about it. \nWhat is desperately needed, is for CONgress to push new nuclear reactors and require that all communities within 100 miles of the ocean,to use desalinated water. This is esp important in the west. Ideally, CONgress would actually help put in several pipelines to simply dump desalinated water into mead, so that it will simply use the current system in place. \nThat is a 300 mile of piping, BUT, we have longer on oil/gas lines.",

We will never keep people from using, but we can surely do better. We will know when this substance is de-scheduled and proper academic studies can be made to answer this question one way or the other.\n\nSurely, Congress must now act on this question if the new president does not. Real life experience e leads me to believe my hunch is right. What about you?",

Although kinda like your wall issues, I'd hold off on the employer penalties until we see that e-Verify is really working as it should. I think one of the problems with e-Verify is holes in the data. It's not always that clear cut whether a \"hit\" from e-Verify is always accurate. As such, I could see a series of court challenges when it denies employment. I agree that employers need to be punished for KNOWINGLY hiring illegals, but they also need to be protected (from the govt and from job applicants) for bad data provided by the applicant and within govt databases. Probably need something like a 2-year mandatory test period before the penalties kick in.  \n\nAnd while I don't want an actual \"wall\", I do think we need a stronger border. While jobs are surely the #1 reason, it's not the only reason illegals break into the US and stay. For instance, some break in to have a baby here.",

Such insurance is required in Europe and is increasingly available here (through groups like the Anerican Alpine club, Global Rescue, etc.)\nClimber rescues are dramatic and gain the most attention but they account for about 4 percent of rescue costs nationwide. \nPersonally, I view rescue services in the same light as fire and police. We save everyone in need, without prejudice (not singling out perceived poor judgement for payment); we pay for it with our taxes as the cost of that civility.

If the growing gap between rich and poor in this country is to be reversed, rebuilding the union movement is essential.  Union decline is not inevitable.  It has continued to grow in places like Spain, Ireland, Chile, Luxembourg and Mexico. But most unions in this country have been slow to change, to modernize, to appeal to younger workers. Some would do well to adopt the German model of cooperation with management to help grow their companies. Often American unions have presented an image of hostility and unreasonable defense of outdated conditions which earns them bad PR which in turn makes it harder for them to recruit new members.

Our reaction and how we deal with a terrorist and an insane person that shoots indiscriminately into a crowd should be very different.\n.\nThis man is a gunman and a mass murderer, but in no way is he a sniper, or a terrorist for that matter.\n.\nP.S.

It is a dirty, house-by-house effort that always (see Israel in Lebanon) is highly lethal to those on the attacking side. It always is to be avoided.\nBy seeking to kill and capture the leaders, we are doing what is the most intelligent and mature response possible: it is highly effective, but it takes a little time.

As to the Charter Amendment giving the Commissioners the added power to fire the HPD Chief, I testified at the Charter Amendment Commission, but at the General Election, I voted against it.  I preferred that the Chief's hiring and firing be left to the Mayor and the City Council.  If memory serves me correct, when the hiring of outside counsel was placed on council agenda, the entire council agreed that the city was duty bound to provide representation to one of its principle employees.  Again, I was the sole testifier in support of the agenda item.  But the retirement agreement appears to retract legal representation away from the Chief.  Furthermore, the Chief is expected to return the retirement money.  I hope the majority is in the right",

Although a $500 reward was offered by local authorities and another $100 by the local black community, the murder remained unsolved.  Previous to this blacks were terrorized, but not actually murdered by the Klan in Oregon. I am not sure if this lead to many people dropping out of the Klan or not as the case was not solved and there was not proof that the Klan was responsible.\nIn Eugene it appears one of the focuses was on getting rid of the police chief who was Catholic and that effort was successful. The Klan did not succeed in denying the hospital (what would become Sacred Heart) non-profit status because it was Catholic or in trying to forbid the Catholic Newman Center next to campus from serving U of O students.",

Seemed to be mostly carefully written and delivered.\nWhile it will inflame those who will hate Trump's 180 degree pivot on Islam, I think it is a step towards better relations and understanding with the Islamic world. To me, it moved the needle on Trump's Middle East policies from a 1 to a 4.\nStill, I have concerns that this was all about security and not much about human rights or democracy, and that he's putting all the blame on Iran and the Shia, although Iranians just voted strongly to retain their moderate president Rouhani.\nBut still, for Trump this was a step forward.",

Permitting the buying of insurance across state lines removes all state controls and create national monopolies, which would probably lead to higher premiums and worse benefits.\n\nI do agree that the ACA is an awkward Rube Goldberg (look it up if you're young) contraption that keeps insurance companies in the loop and will probably self-destruct. We can't afford them. A single-payer system would be much simpler, more efficient, and a lot less expensive.

Hoffman has been amazing at the pitches that are 2-6 inches off the plate, and he will be able to adjust and catch more corners for called strikes on those pitches.  During that inning he was not able to do that without elevating and catching too much plate, but his control is such that small adjustments will be huge, and I see him bouncing back fairly quickly.

We know that Putin has militarily invaded and occupied former soviet territory. We know that Putin covets the Baltic states. We know that Putin covets all of Ukraine, which has a border with Poland. We know that a corridor to Kaliningrad would run through Latvia and Lithuania, through Belarus, or through Western Ukraine and Poland, formerly soviet satellite states. You called my attention to this subject \"a fantasy\". I hope you are right, but just this week, Trump called NATO \"obsolete\" in a major interview in the UK.",

There was one business group which condemned the policy and claimed it would result in the loss of over 50,000 jobs. I am not aware of any university studies on the impact and I've seen no follow-up. At the time I thought the claim of 50,000 jobs lost was an astonishing exaggeration. When you look at the population of BC, the working population, etc., that would suggest the loss of a huge proportion (i.e. a quarter to a half) of minimum wage jobs.
