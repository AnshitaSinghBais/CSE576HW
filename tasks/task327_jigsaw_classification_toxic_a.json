The difference is that Trump was never under investigation.  Why wasn't THAT ever \"leaked\"?  It's the ONLY thing that DIDNT get leaked and the only truth amongst all the smoke screens.  Oh yeah, the other difference, HILLARY GOT INVESTIGATED, and then they whitewashed the truth.  So wake up and smell the coffeve, oh my God did I misspell something ? Shoot me.",

Anytime someone uses LOL in a debate I immediately think they are immature idiots who can't think or debate.  So by your LOL!!!!! ..........",

I do know however, that your restriction doesn't have to do with other users choosing to flag your comments--even if a large number of your comments are flagged (for good reason or not), it is still up to a moderator in the end to decide what to do with them. In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you. However, the restriction should be lifted tomorrow, Jan. 14th!\nThanks,\nEmily",

Does his appearance or skin color or the fact that he lives what is an ordinary life mean he can't, shouldn't, or is somehow unlikely to care about unjust murders or say something? Or that Black Lives Matter activists are all militant simply because they oppose what is clearly wrong. Or that it's radical to do what's right?

This will change in time, but until then, what I tell you is the will of God.\"  That's not what happened.  Jesus told us the reason for his commandment against divorce:  \"What God hath joined together  . . .\" You may disagree with Jesus' reasoning, but that was his stated reason, the only one he mentioned.\n\nYour logic also overlooks that divorce was allowed for one (and only exception):  adultery.  If Jesus forbade divorce only, or even mainly, to protect married women, he would have allowed women (and only women) to divorce on additional grounds (e.g. severe physical abuse or attempted murder).",

FDR disdained Nazism while Henry Ford who rain for the GOP nomination in 1924 and was a Nazi-sympathizer like Charles Lindbergh. \nThe reality is that poor people--and Blacks are over represented in this category due to racism--are both the most victimized as well as the biggest perpetrators of crime.

Does one need to be Jewish to make a movie about the Holocaust? Does one need to be indigenous to make a film about indigenous people (I think the brilliant recent film, \"Embrace of the Serpent\" answers that question with a resounding no). The filmmakers have taken creative license with the source material, and some are likely find this offensive, but that does not mean a culture has been stolen or appropriated. \n\nNow, the money that Disney is going to make from the film is another matter, and one certainly worth the debate.",

American studios have always fed development otherwise ideas and quality projects would never make it to the screen. If the same batch of Toronto based writers remain the go too's for Canadian story, we're in for a long road to nowhere with true, honest, regional based story forgotten about. Truly original will be lost to formula and Toronto centric screenwriting. Does that feel right? If I could add to this post; many writers/ creators have been held hostage while Canadian film and television sorts itself out.

However, it can be difficult for the rear bus to pass the one ahead of it, because it also has to stop at all the bus stops to drop off passengers.\n\nFor people waiting at bus stops, this leads to huge gaps in bus arrivals. If a bus is schedule every 10 minutes, its common that two buses will come every 20 minutes and that the front bus will be too crowded to board and the rear bus has many empty seats. Having streets with multiple bus routes makes the problem worse. \n\nThis bunching problem has pretty much capped ridership on TheBus system at about 70 million rides per year since the early 1980's. It's not that the City can't add more buses, its just that every bus it adds makes the bunching problem worse, leading to slower average travel speeds, and higher per rider costs as the ratio of bus drivers to passengers decreases.",

As such, feminism's professed belief in gender equality increasingly rings hollow as time passes, leading men and women who believe in the principal of equality, to reject the modern iteration of the feminist movement.

He was also a mystic, who did not use his intimate relationship with God to avoid the social evils of his time, but shocked his milieu to the point of being executed as a rebel...Every real revolutionary is challenged to be a mystic at heart, and he who walks the mystical way is called to unmask the illusory quality of human society. Mysticism and revolution are two aspects of the same attempt to bring about radical change. No mystic can prevent himself from becoming a social critic, since in self-reflection he will discover the roots of a sick society. Similarly, no revolutionary can avoid facing his own human condition, since in the midst of his struggle for a new world he will find that he is also fighting his own reactionary fears and false ambitions.\" \n\nHenri Nouwen\n>",

To me, that’s just the right way to do it.”\n\nI will always believe the previous head coach began to put the wheels in motion for a decline in the program when in back-to-back years he brought in graduate transfer QB's instead of doing a better job of coaching who he and the staff had recruited. Because a graduate transfer only has one year to play,  it always felt like an unspoken \"rule\" existed whereby the starting job is assumed for them and no doubt they are not transferring to sit on the bench for that one year.  Thank you Coach Taggart for establishing a new sense of competition! Go Ducks!",

Nevertheless, since you ask my view: I suppose that the capacity to commit evil acts is the unavoidable consequence of creating a universe in which free moral beings have evolved. Since God chose to create such a universe, God is \"responsible\" for evil. God's alternative would have been not to create a universe, or to create a universe in which free moral beings do not evolve. In such a universe there would be no evil. The Christian view is that in the universe that God has chosen to create, evil does not triumph.",

Both runs were healthy in the 80's; both are a mess now. Pointing a finger at commercial fishing ignores the fact that there's been no commercial effort on the first run since the 70's, yet it's arguably in worse shape than the second run (which has been commercially fished every year).   \n\nRebuilding and preserving the runs should be a priority, based on a comprehensive review of spawning and rearing habitat, water quality, user group pressure/harvest efficiency, etc. Anyone proclaiming that eliminating a single user group will solve the problem (KRSA, Joe Connors) is using your gullibility to line their own pockets.",

I've invested in their stock this year based on my positive experience with their service and I will continue to hold the stock in my portfolio and in my children's RESP.

In addition, these have already been fracked and the oil sucked out. So, now by running a SINGLE well down the middle of these and either putting it in the seam or below, they can inject water and have it heated up.

I can't say a lot in his defense--I didn't vote for him--but I won't become a hater or fear-monger. We have sufficient constitutional and even political apparatus in play to keep any president in check. Why not cease and desist the efforts to resist and delegitimize the administration? If you want to see a regime in place more to your liking, get out and work for it. In the meantime I plan to live and let live and practice other principles like that in all my affairs.

What is your issue with wrapping your brain around this fact? Courts have ruled on it. ICE needs to get an actual warrant if they want jails to hold people past their release points. Not a phone call and a pretty-please slow-walk them through release on bond until we can get there. A warrant. THAT would be constitutional.

It's a lost opportunity for a design \"win\" for the arterial retail street that will take away amenities that already exist. \nWould it be so terrible to dig down?

In other words a different profit center than residential rent. In a building with more than 50 micro units at one point (still?) there was space for 5 bikes and no laundry facilities.

Lincoln won the Presidency on a platform to keep slavery out of the new territories, and when he did, \"The Confederacy\" was born.  7 states did not like that idea and attempted to succeed...and they ultimately failed.\n\nSo, when you suggest that white nationalism or racism isnt in our \"DNA\", I have a hard time understanding that.The South has had constant and ongoing racial issues that have never fully healed.

When I have listened to speeches or congressional testimony, I then read the Associated Press and New York Times articles and find slanted views by how they leave out key facts that seems like they don't want America to know. Reporters are to report all sides and let the readers make their own determination as to who is credible. How can we participate in democracy with half the truth and not the other half.

And so far I haven't really seen it. They still get no push on 3rd and short.  Maybe pass protection is better, but preseason just doesn't tell us much since there's few pass-rush studs playing and teams do very little defensive game-planning.\n\nI do like the potential for the team this year though.  I have a feeling OAK overplayed last year, and is overrated as the (mostly) consensus \"expert\" pick to win the division. KC always seems to be there in the mix but has a hard time getting over the top. I think our D gives us the edge, as long as we just get average-ish production from the O.",

If he just leaves Neshek in the game, he either gets Solarte out to end the inning or at least if the inning gets extended, your best RH reliever is still in the game to face Myers. Pulling Neshek just didn't make any sense to me at all.",

She started parking their 4 cars in the yard, mowed down all of the flowers, ripped out the elevated sitting area with waterfall and pond... so they could park more cars in the yard.  She took off with ALL of the furniture in the house when they bailed out in the middle of the night and I had to rip out all of the carpets as they were soaked with red kool aid and who knows what else. \nGhetto is about attitude, not necessarily about money.",

Furthermore it can kickstart a  moribund economy by increasing effective  aggregate demand for goods and services  which are generally essential in nature and hopefully locally manufactured and thus creating a virtuous cycle of more employment. Very creatively , UBI can be implemented through a public banking system in the form of local cryptocurrencies using blockchain technology.This would ensure that money circulates locally , amplifying the multiplier effect in local economies.",

Indeed, the Canadian government went so far as to question him as to whether he was being tortured in the presence of his Saudi torturers. He attempted to sue his Saudi torturers, but this was denied by the UK Justice system. He never attempted to sue the Canadian government. The difference between Sampson and Khadr is that he was a biochemist and cinematoragher, who Amnesty International (a great Khadr supporter by the way) termed as being abandoned by the Canadian government for a crime he very likely didn't commit, and which to this day remains uninvestigated by the Canadian authorities.

Note that the company itself decided which 20 acres of forest which are not suitable for its agriculture and donated the land to the Park Service. The same goes for the parcel which it gave to the water supply. The parcel could affect the water if it planted too close?

Mexico itself need not experience any downside at least in the short term.  What the tariff would do is to raise the prices Americans pay for imported Mexican goods and thus allow higher paid American workers at American manufacturers to compete and over the long term displace Mexican imports.  Americans would have to tighten their belts to pay the price of American made goods, but the long term good would be retention of more manufacturing in the USA.  Mexico can look to the entire rest of the world to retarget its exports and certainly a tariff would not motivate domestic manufacture of a considerable percentage of current Mexican imports.  Enhance American manufacturing.  Minimally, impact Mexico.",

On any given day, you will see that we have surplus generation roughly equivalent to the amount produced by wind generators that is routinely exported at a loss. You will also see how unpredictable wind generation is. Logically, managing that kind of unpredictability is more costly. It is absurd that, through subsidies, we pay more for a kilowatt hour of wind-generated power only to then sell it at a discount to competing jurisdictions. It's the renewables forced on us by the Liberals that have driven costs through the roof. Nuclear is zero emissions, reliable, and way more cost-effective. In short, it works while renewables do not. How on earth will we replace 60% of generation using renewables without bankrupting the province?",

As far as I can determine the Ontario rate for corporate investment income (prov and fed combined) is 50.17% for CCPCs.

Certainly it is not true that investment income in a CCPC benefits from the 15% rate for Part I (operating income)",

It would have also allowed us an outlet other than deeply discounted oil  to America and provided much needed jobs to the East Coast. \nHow are we to fund services, unsustainable government and ongoing debt while purposely limiting and devaluing our own resources? \nWe now see tarrifs on lumber, dairy and bombardier. \nThe picture becomes even more bleak with Trumps America 1st plan, lowers taxes, energy expansion with out punitive carbon tax. \nIt appears our administration is on the wrong side of history and has NO hope of competing. \nWhat now ???",

None of their reporters bothered to read the Appendix of The MacDonald Report.  The Appendix explained in very concise terms how the Province's bean counters figured that selling off Ontario Hydro and opening the grid to out-of-Province supply (always more costly) would lower the price of electricity in Ontario.  The reasoning was rubbish, of course.  The core of the reasoning offered was that an outsider would purchase one of Ontario Hydro's generating units and sell electricity to Ontarians at less than the prevailing price of electricity.",

However I am not a person very concerned with the environment and I would love to have an EV - they are just smoother, quieter, less maintenance hassle and here in BC a lot cheaper to fuel (plentiful cheap hydropower).  I live in Victoria thus I am hardly driving any distance, so range just is not an issue.  There is also the fact that many EVs are a lot peppier than ICE vehicles - those motors give out all their torque instantly, which is a superb benefit in stop-start traffic.  However weighing pros and cons for myself ... I am more inclined to buy a small hybrid next as they are a good compromise - cheaper MSRP than EV and stingy sippers of fuel.",

Our universities are filled with minorities well out of proportion to the population.   That is not the result of white privilege.

The tone for this is set outside of either of these institutions. There does not seem to be any trust from the bottom to the top and vice versa. A strong leader is needed to help us get out of that funk that has been stagnating the processes for a long time now. Anyone caught telling everyone else to sign it then read it needs to be removed from office post haste.

Sure there are families that donʻt need the assistance, but Iʻm guessing there are a lot of families in the designated areas that have a much tougher time than most to make ends meet...if they meet at all. So the bigger picture is using a fraction of our tax money to attempt to help out humanity. Is that such a bad thing?

Why not get them off on the right foot. Hopefully they can parlay this into making a good life for themselves and not become parents that you have a problem with.",

Dad had orders from the Canadian Army in the summer of 1945 to go to the US to begin training on US equipment in preparation for the Invasion of Japan.  (Apparently all allied forces had agreed to only use US Army equipment for the invasion.) \n\nHe was in the Royal Canadian Dragoons (Armoured Car Regiment).  They were to be part of the British Commonwealth Corps in Operation Coronet, the invasion of Honshu to take Tokyo.  The allies estimated that Operation Coronet would be a beach landing 3 - 4x larger than the Normandy Invasion. Just before they were to leave the US dropped those bombs and the war ended. \n\nAs terrible as this poor women's experience was, millions of allies and Japanese were saved by the quick end to that war.",

Also, Ontario is supported by federal per capita revenue which is 50% more than any province.  Finally, Stats Canada data does not include PST, Alta has no PST.\n3.

A company is entirely constrained by the cost of its product.  Imagine the company pays $3 for their widget (after all discounts and rebates are accounted for) and tries to make a profit by reselling it at $2.50.  If anyone thinks they can make a profit this way, don't go into business.  Companies survive by selling their product a prices higher than their net cost.  The difference must also pay for overhead, salaries, insurance, etc. etc.  So if the profit margin is a couple of percent before measure 97, the company must raise prices or go out of business (assuming it can't fire people to reduce cost).\n\nI suspect that Mr. McKinney's company is not subject to the tax so of course he wants his competition to face it.",

Let's face it, he isn't smart enough to do more than get publicity. If he had good advisors, they would be encouraging smart stuff like repatriating all jobs lost to outsourcing by legislative means. His friends don't tell him to help ordinary folks just the rich middle class he is courting. I'll give you an example of failure: Tens of thousands of Canadian jobs are outsourced to third world countries. I got sick of Telus CSR in Manila treating me badly. I stopped usingTelus years ago because they outsource to Manila. Trudeau could make those and thousands of other jobs return here for his voters. Instead he has his ear on the pulse of wealthy investors who are taking the people for a ride into further homelessness and extreme indebtedness from which most will never recover due to Trudeau's friends at the top and their agenda impoverishing the rest of us for them.",

They are NOT small businesses yet they are allowed to pay a 10% income tax and stash the rest in the corporation to lease cars, make real estate investments, expense meals, ski trips and beach vacations under the guise of  professional conferences.  There should be a minimum threshold that to incorporate, you must directly employ at least 1 to 3 people to qualify as a professional corporation.

It is up to the buying of license to actually build something out of the patents, which is by no means a sure thing. \n\nQualcomm is also accused of overcharging royalties. where royalties of its chips are based not on price of chips but on the 'value' of the end products that contain the chips.

The majority is funded through investment income. This is because teachers are required to contribute to pensions right from the first month of contract employment. After 30+ years, this contribution has grown a substantial amount. \n\nI hope that all citizens will have the greater benefits of this kind of system (like CPP). This especially applies to small business owners. As they are often in a risky occupation (restaurant etc), I don't understand why they take a position against a system like the CPP or teacher pensions.

The way I see it, Injections Sites are prolonging the suffering and misery of the addict with the usual end result of death.  Which would be more compassionate?",

Nevertheless, articles in the medical literature started appearing in the 1990s (funded by pharma) saying 80% of nursing home patients were suffering \"severe uncontrolled pain\". This was certainly false in my nursing home. From 2000 onwards, however, increasing numbers of new residents were already on long term narcotics at the time of admission. By 2015 almost 50% of all new admissions to our units were on narcotics, some on doses of 100mg morphine a day or higher. We were almost always able to reduce or eliminate these medications with no noticeable increase in pain. But it could take a year or more.",

The census changed the way the numbers are reported because just counting Native Hawaiians born in Hawaii with 50% ancestral heritage wasn't the intent of the census. This new number is anybody born in Hawaii, which includes Obama. In the recent past, many thousands that are born in Hawaii move to the mainland, mainly the younger people for college, and from there to jobs on the mainland. That is why the number of people born in Hawaii, which makes them (little n) native Hawaiians, is across the country, counting the hundreds of thousands that have moved to the mainland.  That number includes Native Hawaiians but they are a small percentage. It would be necessary to find the last census Native Hawaiians were counted separately.  It was only in the tens of thousands, and that is 50% verifiable ancestry. What is your problem that you are unable to comprehend ancestry?",

I also agree that the overwhelming majority of people in this country are good, decent, hardworking people who are not themselves bigoted. The problem, however, is not individual racism but institutional racism. When the levers of power are predominantly accessible to select classes of Americans -- and denied to others -- discriminatory practices are built into the very structure of that society. What we saw in the election of Donald Trump was a panicked grab for those levers by a class of Americans who not only feels their grip slipping, but also spies those \"other\" classes coming up fast. This is what the \"Again\" in MAGA is all about. The vehemence with which some commenters on this thread deny that fact is proof of the primacy of institutional norms to guide individual behavior, even for otherwise good, decent, hardworking people.",

More taxes on the rich and higher benefit levels would have preserved the neo-liberal governments, although taking these steps would have taken them out of neo-liberalism.  Clinton would have been more of the same and the jury is out as to what Trump is.  While some see potential fascism, that view is probably alarmist.  I fear that the corruption impulse is what we will see, although that is harder to do with a 24 hour news cycle - even with the gutting of the media's investigative reporting muscles.",

Surely, no matter what, there will be a diversity of transit options as time goes on, but we're anemic on some right now. Getting these massive fleets of internal combustion engines out of the civic atmosphere will probably be of great benefit to public health along major roads.",

But that correlation has been nailed down quite well over the years.  \nI do understand where you are coming from when you speak of uncertainties, but in terms of climate change there is very little uncertainty with regards to our role in it.  What is more uncertain is exactly how fast and how damaging the consequences of rapid warming will be.

This gets even \"messier\" when alcohol is involved; and in the majority of these cases it is.  It's important to remember that \"at some point\" of intoxication a woman is no longer considered legally capable of giving such consent.......i.e., you can't get a woman \"falling down drunk\", have sex with her, and then say \"hey, she didn't say \"no\"...it was consensual.  \"Allegations of rape\" ruin lives...true.
