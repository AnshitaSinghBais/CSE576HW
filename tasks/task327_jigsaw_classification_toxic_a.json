Why did God allow the serpent in the garden?  Certainly Adam and Eve did not will the serpent to be there (or whatever realities all these symbols intend to portray).  And if Eve lived in a sinless paradise, she was naive of any knowledge of deceit or cunning, and she appears to be more curious than rebellious.  There is also no evidence that she seduced or tricked Adam, he appears to have been there the whole time.  The story to me shows that God is much more unpredictable, welcoming of risk, and, dare I say, mischievous, than we would like to believe.  Poor Eve has become the object of all our disavowed discomfort and uncertainty about the nature of God",

Jesus tried to teach them to love God and one another.  As Jesus saw it, the Torah had a larger message, summarized in two of the 613: love God and neighbor.\n\nHow did Jesus respond to the \"rule\" on divorce, Deuteronomy 24:1?  What was he trying to teach them, and how did he do it?  He was speaking to law abiding Jews, all of whom probably knew someone who had followed Deuteronomy 24:1.  That is, write a bill of divorce and put the spouse out of the house.\n\nHow do you think they would have reacted when someone they knew, someone who had followed the law, was called an adulterer?  Jesus might as well have said, \"if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out!\"  And, of course, Jesus did say that.\n\nI suppose you could give a literal interpretation to these sayings, but that would miss the point.\n\nDo you still need to evade my answer?",

Yet, our population has grown by by nearly 36% (85 million people) in the same time period.  In the same time period, gun homicides peaked around 1992 at around 7.0/100,000. Yet today the rate is 3.6/100,000.  All of this happened while guns in the public nearly doubled to today's number of almost 350 million.  It is unfortunate that a U.S. military veteran had to die this way. I have sympathy for his friends and family. As for the 77 yr. old guy hunting bears... better to die that way than on the couch.",

Sadly, pubescent boys are simply the most readily available objects for their immaturity to express itself. Also, given that at least 50% of our clergy are gay, as I have suggested, we would expect 50% of sex abusers to be gay IF THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND SEX ABUSE. Since the population at large assumes far fewer priests are gay, its not hard to see how the delusion associating gays and sex abuse can arise--anecdotal impressions regularly mislead us.",

The new Republican division of race, religious beliefs, and the outward judgement of peoples lives, are not the example of the Jesus I read about in my Bible.

It is one of two so-called communist regimes that survived into the 21st century (North Korea being the other) and both have been run by despotic political thugs who have lived in luxury while their people lived in poverty.\nCommunism was the greatest political fraud of the 20th century - it promised so much and delivered so little.  Communism has proven to be a complete and utter economic and political failure.\nI do not condone the massive inequality in capitalist societies - I regard it as a failure of the capitalist economic model.  However, the left-wing liberals should be careful in pushing for equality because that doesn't necessarily mean that the poor will rise to a comfortable middle-class existence, it more often means that the middle class will be reduced to poverty.",

Places like El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala were in the middle of vicious civll wars and genocides, driven by American-backed forces. 80,000 people were killed in ES; 80,000 in two wars in Nicaragua; in Guatemala, a genocide against the native population killed more than 200,000.

He had been greeted warmly by the natives who helped him and his vast ship and crew survive in the foreign land by providing food and guides etc. However his arrogance and disrespect for the people had caused them to stop this gesture of goodwill. Cause, you know, he was being a dick.\n\nOutraged by this, Columbus consulted his shipboard almanac to ask if there was anything he could use to trick the natives. As it happens, there was a lunar eclipse coming up. On the 29th feb, the day of the eclipse, he gathered the natives and told them that god was angry for their disrespect and would take away the sun. Disappearing inside his ship during the eclipse, he waited as the good people begged for their women and children. He agreed to 'bring the sun back', and essentially enslaved the people until he was rescued.\n\nWHAT A DICK.\n\nhappy leap year",

That's not to say that the law and/or the teaching require the bishop to do violence to GLBTQ persons and their families, but they allow him to. I don't think removing the bishop would accomplish much, unless the pope, minimally, enunciates a pastoral policy to guide bishops around the canon law, or better yet, changes the law.\nUltimately, though, we must acknowledge that the teaching and discipline of the church about human sexuality is desperately in need of reform.

My view of our PM' s verbal mistakes from a psychoanalysis stand point is as follows: Justin Trudeau's mind is divided in numerous camps.  For the most part the camps disagree but cooperate to allow the humanistic self to convey a positive message and a feeling of unity. However sometimes the camps will refuse to compromise and will not allow for any flexibility thus disrupting the cooperative humanistic process inside Trudeau's mind. That is when Mr. Trudeau gets confused and in that moment, if he is at a press conference or at a town-hall meeting he makes mistakes and says things that don't make sense. But usually he will realise it later and then rectify the blunder. But to his credit, no other PM in Canadian history has ever done such open meetings with the public.",

All those suburbs have roads and roofs which collect the downpour and deliver it directly into the headwaters of the river systems, resulting in greater than anticipated flow further downstream. Consider the new suburbs south of Caledon Mountain - and the glut of water they add to the original streams after a deluge.

Maybe your kids aren't stupid, but simply need sunlight, some vitamin-C?\nMaybe Florida does better because there is a lot more sunlight there? Alaska seems to have the most depression related events, and general feelings of not wanting to do anything during winter. Well, could poor grades be a depression and lethargy related thing?\nIt would be an easy theory to test. Choose one school, install UV lighting, and see if grades improve.

We are now testing out a program where folks with good performance reviews who have worked with us for more than 1 year can request a 3-month trial period working from home starting 1-day per week and working up to 50% of the time from home after 6 months if all goes well.

Granted man is not helping matters, but, IT WILL happen again.\nPulling out of the pact will not change the way in which we as Americans are moving towards cleaning up our air and environment.\nWe all still have the ability to do our part to minimize the desecration of our air, water and environments.\nI believe in green energy and all that we can do, I just do not like the way you lambast a group of people just because you have a different view.

Who needs to worry about long term profits beyond quarterly earnings and executive bonus targets being triggered?  If the answer is no one then perhaps shareholders are not really long term owners but rather stock market players - leaving employees as the only ones vested in the long term viability of their employers.  Every other stakeholder are beneficiaries of short term earnings, bonuses, and tax- advantaged capital gains and stock options.

In the 1950's Father Fitzgerald had helped found the Order of the Paracletes. This order treated priests, nuns and other religious who were suffering from alcohol and drug addictions and other psychological problems. By the end of the fifties and into the early sixties, Bishops from across the country were sending their problem priests{ pedophile priests] to the treatment center in New Mexico. After attempting to treat these problem priests for several years, Father Fitzgerald came to the conclusion that pedophilia was not treatable. He had gone to his superiors who ignored him.",

As he was no longer there to imprison, it supposedly bailed him on two years' probation, from which he was then said to have absconded.\n\nWhen abducted from Thailand eleven years later, he was forced to say in a tv confession video that he'd voluntarily returned to China to fulfill this sentence. And four of his colleagues were arrested, then bailed to Hong Kong; so that they'd very publicly return to probation of their own.

It would also be just if commentators on these pages would acknowledge that church leaders--clergy and lay--have pursued the mission of Christ in many areas of life over that long time span.

If this country is really serious about solving the “opioid crises” we need to change our whole thinking about the practice of medicine. We need to totally change our collective thinking about pain management. There are hundreds of alternatives to treatments besides immediately popping a pill to solve a medical problem. Prescription drug advertisements need to be banned. Drs need to actually practice medicine instead of pharmacology.The pharmaceutical companies spend millions lobbying Congress so their shareholders can continue to make Billions.

But now Alberta has its own NDP government - there is no work there.\n\nIf the NDP is elected in BC there will be another generation of economic migrants leaving BC. We don't need to do this to ourselves again. We can learn from past mistakes. When the NDP was finally tossed in BC, the electorate was so let down that they annihilated the NDP at the polls. The previous NDP governing party, with a majority, was reduced to two seats. Two seats.\n\nWe would be downright foolish to cut off our noses, to spite our own faces.

How should we react to such comments?  Should we endure them and \"ignore\" them?  Should we respond \"in kind\"? Should we attempt to address them in some non-violent confrontative fashion?

North Korea is no serious threat.  The biggest problem with North Korea is that they act as middle-men for Russian-made missiles and weapons to countries and organizations that wouldn't have access otherwise.  For example, North Korea supplied Iraq with Scuds during the 1991 Gulf War, and has been supplying Iran both missile and nuclear technology (along with Pakistan) since the late-1990s.",

To be successful at politics, Trump needs to build relationships with everyone he'll need in the future for a vote.  Especially if he gets impeached.  Ronald Reagan knew this, which was why he was so successful getting bills passed with a democratic majority in Congress.  Reagan NEVER insulted anyone, he had a great sense of humor, and he knew how to communicate with a broad range of the American people.  After the last vote, Trump vilified McCain,  Murkowsky, and Collins.  While you MAGAphants think he's talking tough, he's really talking stupid.  We who oppose Trump are thrilled every time he attacks republicans.  It's just making it harder to implement his ridiculous ideas.  Not a typical politician, and that's good for the Democrats.",

Compare to the current regime, in which media can't survive economically without control of a whole market, while individual voices explode all over the internet--which, in turn, has become most people's primary source of information.  This harms institutional media economically, but it also scatters public debate and tastes so widely that there is no overarching set of principles that governs either.

Students aren't tested heavily in Colorado.\n\nThe PARCC exams are state mandated for grades 3-10 and require three sixty minute sessions each. They are over a month long testing window. Most schools spread them over a week. The only other state mandated exam are for students designated as English Language Learners (They take an six part that takes about two hours total). Students in 11th grade also take the SAT. \n\nThat means that most students are only in mandated testing six hours a YEAR. \n\nAny other acronym exam they take, STAR (for math) or SRI (for reading), are 15 minute, non-mandated, placement tests that help teachers drive instruction and aren't something kids can \"opt-out\" of just like a kid can't opt out of his US History midterm. \n\nBut hey, the same people complaining about testing want high stakes accountability for kids... you can't have your cake and eat it too.",

I may no like his behavior either, but I admire him regardless because being honest and genuine is important to me, more important that specific actions.  Regarding policy, its a mixed bag.  Medical care should be single payer or nationalized.  No candidates are supporting what the people need.  War, I hate it.  We should not be at war.  Hilary talked of going head to head with the Russians, incredibly stupid.  Trump fired on Syria.  I wish he hadn't cause I think it was a set up.

The water vapor mixing ratio only changes with temperature, and is a feedback to CO₂ changes. And again, the consensus estimate for the contribution to the GHE from water vapor is ~50% (not 91%), and the contribution from CO₂ is ~20%. 20% of 33K is not \"3 C\".\n\nWater vapor is indeed the closest thing to a \"black body\" selective absorber, but it does so quite near the surface. The energy balance is determined by the energy flux differential at the effective emission height significantly higher in the troposphere where water vapor is scarce, and CO₂ remains well-mixed. In contrast to your odd assertion of \"not much energy\" at the absorption band of CO₂, a quick look at the Earth's Planck curve with GHG interaction tells a different story.\n\nhttps://chriscolose.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/rad4.gif",

Back in the day, the Episcopal Church was called the (Rockefeller) Republican Party at prayer. If you wanted to succeed in business, the best place to start was a tony Episcopal Church, preferably in a tony suburb. Why else do you think Prescott Bush, Poppy's daddy, moved from Ohio to Greenwich, Ct. and promptly joined Christ Church, THE Episcopal Church for ambitious up-and-comers like Prescott? Back in Ohio the Bushes were Presbyterian, which was the thing in Ohio. When Poppy moved his family to West Texas in the seventies they all became Methodist because the First Methodist Church in Midland was THE place for ambitious politicians.\n\nNowadays you don't need to belong to the right sort of church in order to succeed in business, so once the sixties came and went the Episcopalians lost a lot of dead weight (though admittedly a lot of money) when the barely spiritual left",

We still don't, despite the almost daily revelations once the investigation really got going. Had Obama remained in office, I'm certain he would have jumped on it as soon as it became clear what was going on.

I...disagree.\n\nFor 99% of history, men have been defined as the biologically superior gender, and as such, men have taken charge of everything involving intellectual/creative effort, based on  whatever primitive 'science' early civilizations managed millenia ago.  Women have spent most of history cramped in a few, forced social roles based on the same facile 'biology' of aeons ago - subjugation through lack of control over their own actions, restricted opportunities, and rights more appropriate for their historical status as men's possessions/breeding sows. The fight for women's education allowed our gender the context to really SEE their inequality - and the reasoning skills  to slay the flaws that underpin sexist beliefs. \n\nAnd cons have a ton of science advancement to read up on.",

It's an open question what would happen if Canada and/or Mexico aren't inclined to go along with his terms, as it then turns into a very dangerous game of chicken. The big question might be whether Trump *understands* how important NAFTA is (in this article, Mr Donohue says that he does).

I suspect very few small businesses (fewer than 100 employees) especiare incorporated to avoid taxes. They do so to further their owners' dreams, indulge their passions, to live as independent people (as opposed to being a \"wage-slave,\", in short, \"to be the boss.\") and, of course, the hope that they'll more money than they would as employees. For most, \"Making more money\" by avoiding taxes is, for most, a ridiculous strategy. That's like saving dimes as you make the dollars.

It's hardly accurate to say that \"Tahitians\" or \"Marquesas\" were the first people here, when Native Hawaiians have genealogical ties to every wave of Pacific Island settlers pre-Cook arrival - Native Hawaiians/Kanaka Maoli were the first people here.  \n\nThe 1893 Overthrow disfranchised most Native Hawaiians from politics.  There's clear evidence of this throughout the last decade of the 19th century and it culminates in a majority of Native Hawaiians protesting the insurrectionist government in a formal petition to the US (aka Anti-Annexation Petitions).",

If you think income sprinkling is acceptable then introduce a family tax return so all can make use of this.  This nonsense of issuing \"stock\" to family members so they can receive dividend  income when they have contributed nothing (neither labour or capital) to the business is also dubious.  Most small business owners are in business because it is their best chance to make money and avoid working for someone else.
