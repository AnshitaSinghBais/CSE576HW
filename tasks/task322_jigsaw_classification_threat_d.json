I feel that my neighbors, who are largely excellent dog owners, and would not let their dogs in my yard, are incapable of comprehending the harm they do through their cats.

Although their fish fertilizer is really nice, and you could use a little of that in addition to the others.

Apparently, the word FATHER was traditionally reserved for priests, whereas the word MOTHER was proper for female parents.\n\nIrish Catholics usually seemed to prefer “dad”, or less often, “da”.  I knew kids who used the word “pop”, but none seemed to be of Irish descent.  Some of my Protestant friends used the word “father” to address their male parent, which seemed weird to me as a child.\n\nMy mother and aunts usually used the word “mother” to address their female parents.  Although my mother would have liked me to do the same, times had changed and I insisted on caller her “mom”.  She endured this generational shift, but did make it clear that calling her “ma” or “mummy” would be disrespectful.\n\nIncidentally, during my early childhood, our pastor was called “Monsignor”, which seems to be equivalent to “My Lord”.",

Cut the PFD completely to allow each Alaskan to contribute their share of the state's resource wealth to state services in an equal and fair manner.

While O'Leary differs from Trump on many matters of opinion, style and belief, he shares with Trump the image of the bigger-than-life outsider and loner - and the Conservative Party now risks falling under his sway.\n\nHistory shows that charismatic demagogues and the movements they lead rise to heights and fall quickly to oblivion in times of anxiety.

People don't have time or resources for Uncle Jim or an injured neighbor when they are working a second job and living paycheck to paycheck. The \"stretched thin\" world, in turn, is a symptom of income inequality. Most people are barely getting by and an increasingly small group are doing better than ever. I'd like to see more legislation designed not to punish the rich, but crack down on those that evade their responsibilities with arcane financial set ups, and more training (like Germany) on trades work that can give a decent income for hard work.",

If we are able to discover the roots of violent behavior, whether with a gun, a knife, a club, fists, feet, or whatever, the tool used in violent acts would become irrelevant.\nAs to deferring to criminals, that's turning things upside down. We are deferring to law abiding citizens who own firearms.\nThen there's the issue of law abiding citizens accepting limitations on their behavior. Again, this is upside down. What law abiding citizen do is to place limitations on those who would behave in a manner that is not ethical or moral; essentially creating the legal means by which to curtail such behavior.\nRoss Nesberg is upside down on this issue.",

Our believe that abortion is immoral ultimately depends on our conviction of life beyond the grave, which forces us to ask when that immortality begins, we have concluded it begins in the earliest stages of pregnancy...so abortion is taking of human life.\n\nBut our believe in freedom of conscience forces us to take the perspective of the other, and we are forced to concede that for those who do not accept immorality, for those who believe that this life is all there is, the fetus reasonably (albeit incorrectly) be understood to be non yet fully human life. \n\nYour other instance are different.",

There are compromises that must be made in order to make such a system work for everyone, not just a privileged few.

At this time, it appears Clallam County citizens have been deprived of another $800,000.00! It also appears Clallam County citizens may not be aware of what Ms. Goschen testified was $8.2M in public funds spent on the CRTC endeavor thus far….an endeavor that has purportedly earned a whopping $28,000.00 and employs 17 people! Just imagine how far $8,200,000.00+ could go to create actual living wage jobs for Clallam County citizens if these funds were entrusted to honest and competent business persons?",

Frankly, our prison system needs to see the upgrades and rebuilding of facilities that Gov. Ige advocated in his State of the State address earlier this year. Get the Legislature to start focusing on that first, and then maybe we can talk about attire issues. \n* What about the families of prisoners in the mainland and what they have to suffer? Better yet, where is the article that says \"bring them home, here is how\". \n\nAgain, priorities....and keeping our eye on the big issues facing our prisons and prisoners in this state.",

The computer and telecommunication/television had come by 1957 and were changing all facets of society. Refrigeration was improving home life, medicine and indoor comfort.\n\nWhile your immigrant-to-invader observation is apt, your suggestion that the U.S. can no longer absorb immigrant labor is off the mark. Many immigrants arrive with plenty of \"high skill\", from computer technology to science to medicine.\n\nBut immigration isn't just about filling the workforce. \"Huddled masses yearning to breathe free\" isn't just about labor.

One could argue that the sloppy reporting reflects an institutional bias towards women who put forward sexual assault complaints.  You're right to highlight the discrepancy between St. John and Toronto.  That's probably because in Toronto the assaults are not even recorded and because woman don't report them since they know they'll be dismissed. \n\nAlso, different jurisdictions will have different ideas on what these categories mean.  Overall, these statistics show that the system is not working and is in a poor state.  Winnipeg has almost none dismissed, but then again, they don't all make it to court, so what's going on there?",

Paxton would look at 1 or 2 Wrs, if they weren't open he would just run, whether or not the pocket broke down, that is a major red flag to me. And the few times he stay in the pocket for the most part couldn't located an open Wr in early part of the game.\n\nThe part most of you guys didn't see was when the Broncos went to commercial, the coaches were huddle around Paxton basically tell him the coverage. The coaches were basically telling Lynch the Bears are were running a few basic coverages. For the most part, the Bears were in cover two most of the night, Trevor Siemian know it and was slicing and dicing the Bears for 6/7 for 51 yards.

K&T's work demonstrated that there are legitimate behavioural reasons why certain active investing strategies will provide higher than market returns.

And of course, the assumed rate of return is still way too high, so more pain to come for the taxpayers. Perhaps more focus should be put on the way PERS invests, investment costs, etc. Not that the rate of return will get back to 7 percent any time soon, but I do know, for example, that its hedge fund and private equity investments have underperformed for the better part of a decade.

Even NK's allies, Russia & China, supported these measures.\n\nBy passing these resolutions in last fortnight the UN escalated the crisis because oil shipments to NK will be cut and NK exports of textiles as well as other goods will be stopped.  \n\nMoreover, in 1950 it was the UN which intervened to stop NK's invasion of SK.\n\nYou obviously did not Google \"Korea Songun.\"\n\nAnd you are obviously just another ignorant progressive troll who knows nothing about the North Korean Missile crisis.\n\nYou won't be fed any more, ignorant progressive troll.",

I believe that our country has a moral duty to protect those in need regardless of their ethnicity or religious beliefs. The Government of Canada should accept all refugee claimants from Syria that have already been cleared to enter the United States. These claimants are now indefinitely barred entry into the United States by President Trump's executive order. My understanding is that these people have already been vetted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, FBI, and National Counterterrorism Center. Therefore, accepting these refugees into our Canadian family poses no threat to our security; not accepting them is a threat to our values.",

Luck went his way this year and he also drove very well, winning nine races (Hamilton won ten) . Hamilton had to contend with a new crew of mechanics on his car when management switched the crews and numerous mechanical failures throughout the season. If not for the DNF's he would have won the WDC again. It is smart to go out on top, Rosberg did well (better than his dad Keke) and he doesn't need the money it would seem.

The rector took his lover into his home, and he and some parish members helped nurse the dying man until he passed away.  It wasn't until after the lover died that the rector found out that his congregation had always known that he was gay -- and they never cared.

We have proof that Coughlin believed his own lie. Later that same year when Hitler signed his friendship pact with Stalin, Coughlin recanted his support for the Nazis. He didn't realize Hitler was playing Stalin for a fool - and if fascists were forming alliances with communists then he could no longer support them.\n\nPerhaps you too, like Coughlin, believe the lie.

I'm just pointing out that it appeals to natural law and NOT the Hebrew Scriptures to support its claim. In fact, the Church rarely appeals to Scripture at all when it formulates its teachings on sexual morality. The Church's teaching against homosexual acts are along the same lines as its teaching against masturbation and birth control -- that is, these things are forbidden because they dissociate sexual gratification/acts from their natural procreative ends.\n\nIf one endorses this paradigm and is consistent, then ANY act causing sexual gratification that does not involve the penis inside the vagina would be considered sinful. That chiefly includes oral sex among married heterosexual couples. Non-procreative by every stretch of the intellect. But we know that never happens. ;-)\n\nPersonally I find such appeals to nature to be flimsy. But this is the currently accepted paradigm among RCC theologians.",

Unfortunately, it is not the \"cold war mind-set\" that is pervasive today, but rather a reflection at how they altered that course and chose a distinctively repressive route similar to their old ways.",

He forced the Church to accept him back regardless of his Gender identity. He defend the rights of Transwomen who were sex workers as Cardinal. But he still has a rigid and a backwards view of how Gender actually operates, thinking it's biologically determined when it's not. That view has harmful effects on Trans and Non-binary people that can be very exclusive. \n\nIn a sense I find it ironic that as a Jesuit who is so enlightened on some topics(Climate Change, the poor, etc) he is still in the middle ages on this.",

It's up to the law-abiding citizen to decide what, how and where to carry openly or concealed, not you. Also community watch programs and patrols can be combined with other activities like just going for a walk around the block for some fresh air.

In the first ballot Michael Ignatieff was easily the most popular candidate with Bob Rae second and Dion a distant 3rd with less than 18% of the vote.  Similar story in the second round of balloting where Dion managed only 20% of the vote and was still a fairly distant 3rd place finisher.\n\nIt was only when they got down to the 3rd and 4th round of balloting that people, grudgingly, decided that they would prefer the 'bland' Dion over the more controversial Ignatieff or Rae.\n\nAnother potential problem with ranked ballots is seen in Australia where they have reduced elections to a de facto two-party system.",

Our moral law must be more humanistic, telling the faithful how to live the happiest of human lives - which does not necessarily imply license.  The biblical justification is that Jesus is meek and humble of heart, his yoke is easy and his burden light.

Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

This sounds very much like what is happening in the rest of the country for the majority of the population.  The problem is double dipping...having to pay income tax AND consumption tax.  With the current state of our tax system, there is virtually no meaningful discretionary income left over to handle the cost of every day living expenses. It is hard to sell more taxes if the cupboard is bare.\n\n Let's give all working people a break and abolish income taxes.  Income taxes were first introduced as a temporary measure to help with financing the federal government's efforts to  help our allies in the  1st World War.  Time to repeal that law.  Then perhaps introducing taxes for other causes would be more palatable.",

Either Israel goes to one person, one vote as a single state, like the very brave South Africa, or it shrinks its soul daily with what destroys all apartheid countries. Zionism, by the very definition of Zionism, is a deliberate policy of racism so is anti-democracy.\nLoving democracy and peace is not anti-Israel, not in the least. And loving apartheid isn't defending Israel, in the long run.\nHugh Massengill, Eugene",

Thank goodness DIA was built with a design that does allow for such expansion, rather than one of the \"everything close-in\" designs that suffer from lack of expansion capacity.  \n\nYes, you have to walk a little more.  Yes, you have to take a few escalators (I'm still puzzled as to why that's supposedly a bad thing).  Yes, you have to take a (rather efficient) train between concourses.

Doesn't the evil one just love the gray areas to draw people into evil? AL is craftily worded and vague enough to appear harmless, but it's full of ideas that open Pandora's box for individual interpretation of God's teaching and a slippery slope ride into evil. What's worse, is that Pope Francis' own penned letter to some bishops shows that he supports Holy Communion for adulterers living in the state of mortal sin, all the while calling it a pastoral practice of accompanying those persons. The truth is that when people in the state of mortal sin receive Holy Communion, they are NOT growing in holiness, but receive sacrilegiously and go deeper into sin, calling judgment down upon themselves.

Firstly, having influence over someone does not equate to having a veto over every decision they make. Southey is basically arguing that because Ms. Trump has been unable to stop every poor decision made by her father, her claims of being able to positively influence her father are completely bogus. This is an impossible and unreasonable standard to hold someone to.\n\nSouthey claims there is no evidence of Ms. Trump positively influencing her father, but this is belied by the facts. It has been widely reported that Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, played a key role in pushing the President to pursue a more moderate repeal of Obamacare keeping major elements of that policy in place, despite condemnation from the Freedom Caucus.

In this family, only one white southerner in eleven actually owned slaves, but they all lived off the avails of human slavery.",

They selectively absorb certain wavelengths of IR emitted by the solar-warmed Earth, and then reemit that radiation in all directions.

Answer: risk by groupthink association. If everyone is a closet indexer, there will be opportunity and higher probable future returns in not buying the index. Anyone who believes otherwise now is deluding themselves. The third question you should ask yourself is whether your sample period is sufficiently long enough to draw conclusions. Answer: no.

This gives +Francis a golden opportunity to rid the Church of this order which was \"conceived in sin\" by the sick mind of Maciel, even if +John Paul II fell all over himself in accepting the huge amounts of money Maciel gave him and others in the Curia.  The pathology that festers for decades starting with its founder rarely allows for a recovery to a degree of health necessary for the challenges of Church ministry.

The evidence based system was in its baby infancy in the 1970s and 1980s, when many of the seeds were sown for the present epidemic. It has really only been since the 1990s that evidence based medicine has been hitting its strides, hitting critical mass, to make a difference.\n\n2. It was the tools of evidence based medicine that uncovered the mechanism of the current epidemic. Decades ago a tiny entry published in a medical journal, by Drs. Porter and Jick, was sadly a catalyst for our present mess. The widespread misinterpretation of that publication WAS NOT evidence based medicine, a fact REVEALED BY tools of evidence based medicine.",

As to the rights of the widow of the US soldier, they are no in any way compromised by the payout. Her action is against the tortfeasor and if the US courts thinks their soldiers or the widows of their soldiers can and should sue for death or injury sustained in a war zone, that is their decision. Canada's courts will now get a chance to review it before allowing or disallowing enforcement of a US court order in this country. This is exactly what should happen.

The rational system would a University of Oregon and a State University system. Each would have their leaders a provost and their charges. OS Universities serving the state through regional units and university extension. U of O combining the Eugene and OHSU campuses. Look north or south and we have see leadership and strong distinctions and control. In this way Cascades, Eastern, Southern and Western would be an articulate vision meeting regional and statewide needs...PSU could argue with this but they should have been part of either group a long time ago.

There will be many, many people in the path of totality, coming from out-of-state, even out-of-country and there will be a large concentration of them in the Madras area. It is already too late to obtain lodging in motels, hotels or campgrounds in the totality path. There may be a few, but price gouging has already began, even in towns outside of the path. I say this based upon many phone calls months ago. Your best approach would be staying overnight on the 20/21 with a friend or relative located in the path of totality, so that you can view it that morning. The totality experience is completely different to a partial experience, so it is worth your trouble, but the traffic will definitely be a problem that morning.

And trade, we've got to see trade as opportunity, not as— competitive— scary thing, but one in five jobs being created in the trade sector today, we've got to look at that as more opportunity.

Bock says that without government guaranteeing you good health (not just health care, but good health!), you can't pursue other values. Well, even more basic, is to be without food. Shouldn't there be a government program that gives you free food?\n\nA socialized UK system is hardly a model. To control costs--as such \"free\" programs must--it rations health care.

And further, I would argue, the best way forward (that is the way that is most likely to survive into the future with respect) is to strive to identify that trace of the Spirit to be found in our past rather than just throw it out for something new.

I also understand that he thinks her claim to have a Native American heritage presents a political opportunity for her opponents -- but his use of the name of a Native American hero as a slur demeans him and the presidency. During the election, I sometimes referred to Trump as “Dirty Donald”, imitating his proclivity for naming his political foes (Little Marco, Lyin’ Ted, Crooked Hillary, etc.); it seemed appropriate shorthand for a man who has lived a filthy life personally, professionally and politically. I discontinued the reference on November 9, not because I suddenly acquired respect for him, but because I do respect the office to which he was elected. It’s too bad he doesn’t respect it. What a despicable, filthy, cowardly, petty little man this president is.",

It seems like both the big heavy planes and the skilled pilots are close to becoming obsolete, so I am glad to see the Navy re-evaluating their needs and direction before impacting so drastically the unique central island - if in fact, the original plans have simply become outdated.\nMy faith in and support of Naval operations on Whidbey will be hugely improved if the original plans are altered to take into account the downsizing of planes, numbers of planes, and pilots due to new technology.",

I think it's a lot easier for church prelates to think in terms of centuries, and to set policies and positions accordingly.   I'm not at ALL sure they'd think that same way were the married, with children of their own.  The difference is pretty simple to understand.  \n\nThe older I get, the more I realize how short a span of time we are here.  If I had absolute confidence in all the church taught, perhaps matters like the ordination of women wouldn't bother me.  But the simple truth, is that I lack that faith.  And in the scandal, I think we can see rather clearly where such a complete faith can lead.  So time IS important in my life, and that of my children.  \n\nThis temporal element to our lives becomes important in this discussion, and any decisions as to whether to stay or leave. \n (to be cont'd)",

Some pedestrians have this preconceived perception that they do not have to look before crossing a street and proceed walking off the curb right into the roadway w/o looking.\n\nThis program is most likely federally funded or funds granted upon participation and the primary reason for the participation.

Our Friday prayer did not disrupt anyone's learning, it didn't cost the school a SINGLE penny, and in fact most non-Muslim kids didn't even know Friday prayers were even held by Muslim kids in the school. \n\nIf you're talking about the Lord's Prayer being removed, that was its removal from the actual classroom, and even then only for the public school system. The taxpayer-funded catholic system still has the Cross up in the classrooms. None of this is even remotely equivalent to the unfounded objections about Friday prayers - they are not being held in a classroom setting, and it's not being taught or forced to any non-Muslim students - or to the Muslim students who don't pray at all.",
