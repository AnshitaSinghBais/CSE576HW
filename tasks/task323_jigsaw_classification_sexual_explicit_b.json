I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

If that's the point you're trying to make, him taking her into the men's room and a transgendered person using the women's restroom are two totally different scenarios. A male who identifies as female isn't going to have his penis on display in the female bathroom, because the stalls are all behind closed doors, so only a pervert who's peeking under or over stalls is going to know that the female in the next stall was actually born a male. If it's not, an unintended consequence of the ordinance would be that it would be difficult for him to take her out alone because it will prohibit her from entering the men's room because she doesn't identify as male.",

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

He's had innumerable girl friends, mistresses and victims. He described his efforts to avoid venereal disease while living a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle as his \"personal Vietnam.\" In that context, he described himself as a \"great and very brave soldier\" -- a manifestation of his contempt for real soldiers. He's a racist and a fascist who mocks the handicapped and attacks women.  The fact that some putatively pro-life and pro-family voters have glommed on to him demeans and disgraces those causes, and the fact that some members of the Catholic clergy are giving cover to vote for him is a lasting stain on the church.",

And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

As far as definitions go, society as a whole must through elected representatives define what various actions and scenarios violate law and what consequence to apply.  As I see it, we have trivialized sexual assault to mean anything a woman does not like.  Rarely is sexual intercourse the issue.  No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.  I think humans will always find things to piss them off.  No matter how close to perfect life is, complainers will still be there.",

You are what you are, whether its politically correct or not, accept the facts and truth.   \n\nAs far as the bathroom issue, I believe a human with a penis should use the mens bathroom.

You can't just have it because it's fun or because it makes you feel closer to your spouse. \n\nBTW, that's the main argument for the perpetual virginity of Mary: Sex is sinful, so the sinless Mary didn't engage in it. \n\nSo, they said that \"natural law\" says that the proper reason for sex is procreation, and sex must be \"open\" to it.

He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

We now know pedophilia is intractable, but ephebophilia behavior is more complex. Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy.

NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.

The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

It is not.  \n\nThe question of having sex in a way that \"avoids pregnancy\", which seems a new one in this thread, is definitely more complicated.  While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

Our bus driver was our music, PE and art teacher, so it was like a big family. The kids in the 4th grade and 8th grade, became assistant instructors and help the younger kids out, so the teacher never had to stop the lessons. It worked very well, not to mention it helped create a sense of citizenship and community. We can never go back to those days and I'm sure glad I don't have to attend the schools we have today. There are some lessons to learn from those times but education today doesn't understand the concept nor do they have a base for such perception. It can't be fixed but I feel bad for the youngsters now days. How is it that any 2-3 year old can tell you what they want to be but by the 6th grade they no longer care!",

Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive. Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop. I think it's important for people who care about the climate to explain that to their fellow citizens. As to gentrification, cause gentrification; what causes gentrification is rich people moving here. If we built zero new housing, the rich people moving in would still drive up the price of the existing housing.",

First, the 90 year period it too long and not representative of the world today.

I don't ask.\"\n\nand Kathleen Wynne, our Premier , with a MA in Linguistics and a ME from OISE , when asked about the price of pizza said : \"The fact is what we have to do is we have to come to an agreement.… We need a working partnership with our education workers and with trustee associations.\"\n\nso is it any wonder when Thomas gets asked on the exam, how much does it cost to buy 100 pizzas at $20.00 per pizza, he answers,, I don't know, but let me tell you, I'd spend twice as much",

He was 15 years old, one year past the age limit to be considered a child soldier, at the time (UN definition). Fighting against Canada and/or our allies (e.g. the many IED's he build and probably planted) is treason. Murdering a medic is against the Geneva convention and a war crime. He fought along side terrorists against Afghans in order to force barbaric fundamentalism on the population (e.g. girls could no longer go to school) and to have the Taliban rule. He was tried in a court of law and convicted for his crimes - 40 year sentence.  He said that killing Sgt. Chris Speer was the greatest day of his life and that he would gladly do it again. He is a terrorist, murderer and war criminal. He should have faced the consequences for that. He was very fortunate to be given his freedom. More than his victims ever got.

Even accelerated bi-weekly payments of $1,000 will yield substantial benefits.  But the equivalent amount paid on a monthly basis is certainly not virtually the same thin.\n\nIn addition to the benefit of 52 payments a year accelerated weekly also means you are drawing down your mortgage every week rather than every month.  Over a 25 amortization period that amounts to about $22K in interest savings on a $150K mortgage.  The reason - interest is computed daily regardless of your payment frequency.  \n\nSo yes if you could pay hourly it would be even better.",

It is interesting to note that the Online Etymology Dictionary link I provided doesn't include the derivation you got from the Urban Dictionary. The derivation I have quoted has now been in use for 89 years, and the derisive \"be contemptible\" connotation has now been in use for 46 years. Consider: http://womenshistory.about.com/od/feminism/a/Feminism-in-1971.htm — perhaps the derision was a backlash to Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem founding the National Women’s Political Caucus in 1971.",

But his account in Insight seeks to exemplify insight and judgment by finding the most unbiased researcher, which is why in the first prat of the book, he turns to scientists. Yet, the seems to me not to represent the consciousness we experience, biased and prejudiced as Gadamer argues. It also undermines his notion of the isomorphism of cognitional structure and metaphysical; structure, because such unbiased minds don't really exist. Still, I don't see how that disconfirms Gould, especially since Bernard speaks of diverse realms of meaning, offering the example of a scientist and his young child looking at a giraffe, with quite different questions. Mainly I like Gould because he strongly supports the magisteria of science as 100% normative, although he is weak on theology (being an agnostic).",

My position is both QB's are still young and inexperienced and need more game time experience to learn from.

I felt opposing defenses had a pretty easy game plan against both QB's because they knew Denver couldn't run.  I know everyone expects improvement, but there is no comparison between summer camp scrimmages along with preseason games and a regular season game with all the pressures that go along with winning them. Coaches have much more pressure on them and it's important for them to remember that ball control offense led by a strong running game is the young QB's and your defenses best friend. If Joseph puts Lynch or Siemian into a position they need to throw 40 or more times a game it's going to be another long season in my opinion. Patience is the key.",

Using the brake to control the speed of the vehicle is more precise than using the accelerator and in conditions of low traction will help both drive wheels to turn rather than spinning one. This technique is called Controlled Throttle Management(CTM) and this is how it is done. Press hard on the brake pedal and shift into the appropriate gear. Gradually increase the throttle till the car is trying to move. Now with light removal and application of the brake, the car can be moved in tight increments with precise control of speed and position. Very little movement of the brake pedal is required and the throttle needs to be held at a constant engine speed - usually about 1000 rpm. When connecting trailers I even shift my truck into 4 low for even more precise control.",

It merely states that its principles are compatible with democratic values and systems. Any conservative admits to the legitimate role of social and economic justice and of the enforcement of high ethical standards in the way business is conducted. They will also admit to the necessity for government involvement in these areas.  Justice is in fact at the center of free market economic models and no one would say that laws covering how business is conducted is out of place.",

But that logic is dead wrong! Just looking at the Kinder Morgan NEB assessment hearings will demonstrate to anyone that the NEB is a captured regulator looking out after the interests of oil barons rather than the citizens of Canada. My concern is that the same thing will be true of the so-called Development Bank. It should not be located in the financial district of Toronto because it too will likely become a captured regulator reflecting the reviews of high finance rather than the needs of Canadian citizens.\n\nMy view is that the NEB or its successor agencies should be located in Ottawa and so should the so-called Development bank. Before any projects are approved by either institution, they should be reviewed by fresh eyes - people understand the industries but are not involved in them financial or careerwise.",

It is one thing to demand that agents must receive from a judge the permission needed to use the methods and must show to the judge their evidence of suspicion to warrant permission.\n\nIt is another thing to demand that the agents explain to me and to publicize how the methods work at a technical level.

This is why the USA is putting out new sanctions against Russia to target their business with Europe: The USA wants to prevent Russia's economy from growing. But Russia has diversified and domesticated its trade and production enough that the USA doesn't have a lot of capability to harm Russia further through sanctions.\nAlso, purchasing power is a lot higher in Russia than in the West, and so Russia's GDP results could be higher than Canada's.\nBut Putin has done a very good job with Russia's economy, compared with where it has come from.",

They are also called \"paper mouths\" because their bite is almost undetectable, and it's easy to tear the hook out of their mouths. Jigging helps to set the hook.

However from what I have looked up under Pope Francis women's issues have been discussed and given more prominence at the Vatican(Cardinal Turkson's meeeting of popular movements is one major forum). You combine this with his openness on female deacons and his praise for feminism in the Joy of Love and there is some progress being made, however slow. \n\nHonestly decades from now i think people are going to look back at Francis's papacy as the moment when the seeds of much needed changes were put in place.....whatever our current cynicism.",

You dare not write your own thoughts or conclusions for fear of being accused of cheating. So essay writing is an exercise  in cutting and pasting that allows you to legally copy. Your conclusions should agree with your professor's if you want a decent grade. Sadly I do not believe critical thinking is part of an Arts curriculum any longer. That is why Arts degrees have so little value.",

The Obama Administration then appealed to the Supreme Court.  On June 23, 2016, the Supreme Court announced it had deadlocked 4-4 in a decision that left in place the lower court’s preliminary injunction blocking the program.

In English the authority given is word for word identical but in Greek the \"you\" is \"you plural\"-- desete and lusete. And in this parallel passage, this authority is given to the ekklesia, the gathered community of believers. \n\nI then went on to suggest that the extrapolation of Peter in Mt16 to successive bishops of Rome is problematic ON THAT SCRIPTURE ALONE; whereas the extrapolation of Mt18 from the ekklesia to the Church as the entire community of the believers ON THAT SCRIPTURE ALONE is not problematic.\n\nHow subsequent ecclessiologies over time deal with these texts is a further relevant question.\n\nDo we disagree on this minimalist proposition?",

When he dies, he still has the $2M pot of money (or his heirs do) assuming it is in equities and not an insurance policy.\n\nPerson B:  Gets a defined pension benefit of $80K.  Assume this is 4% of the pension funds, which would be $2M.  When the person dies the owner of the pension fund (the $2M) stays in the pot.  If the province, then in the provincial pot, etc.\n\nTherefore, Person A really does have an asset of $2M, but Person B doesn't have any asset when they die.\n\nThere must be an accounting reason that full value can be assumed to be an asset for a defined pension plan, but I don't understand why.

It's certainly not from wage growth in Canada which I believe is in the neighbourhood of 1.5% (compared to 2.5% in the U.S.). We'll see in the next six months what happens in Toronto housing market as to whether the good times continue to roll. \nOne also can expect that gov't spending and their accompanying deficits have contributed to recent growth.

As teenagers, I believe we have all rebelled against our parents/teachers/society at one time or another and these individuals used this flag as a symbol of rebellion.  I believe we should quit looking at the immediate negativity of things and start teaching people to think on their own.

But you just don't want to see that way, because you have your own opinion, and apparently your opinion matters more than the opinions that actually matter",

The first step was to try and divorce biblical Judaism of the Torah from later Judaism of the Talmud. Then Messianic Jews could distinguish what was is really a religious issue and what is a cultural one.\n\nThe same with Islam. Many things we associate with \"Islamic\" are actually manifestations of Arabian culture, or the later Haddith, and not the religion of the Qu'ran. So a Messianic-Muslim shouldn't, for example, feel obliged to where a Burkha. \n\nAnd funny you mentioned head dress. The only religion with explicit commands about wearing head dresses is Christianity, in 1 Cor 11. Yet we explain those texts away today don't we? \n\nMuhammed was a deeply flawed person - but any more than OT prophets? His fundamental message was for Arabians to abandon paganism and worship the God of Abraham. Judge him by his time and place, not ours.",

Spend a couple of million dollars doing a great study showing your tumeric-probiotic product aids in digestion, only to find everyone else can copy it and use your study to sell their products.  This is why the \"evidence\" behind natural products will never reach beyond a certain level.  \nAs for the \"3 billion dollar\" industry, unlike the pharmaceutical industry it's comprised of more small entrepreneurial companies who believe they have a unique product and want to bring it to market.  \nAnd if you think there's currently a lot of choice available in Canada you are very mistaken (ever been to the US anyone?).\nBut the most worrisome aspect of all of this is the paternalistic attitude HC has towards Canadians ability to research and choose for themselves.  The most educated and internet savvy nation on the planet??\nSo why is HC making these changes? There's the real question.",

(The pool of people wanting 18-month contracts is small.)\n\nSecondly, many simply won't come back (but of course won't tell you until month 17).\n\nWhat this all adds up to is, a disincentive to hire women, particularly those in the 25 to 35 age bracket.  The risk of them being gone for 3 of the next five years (because most women don't have just one child) is too high.\n\nFrom the worker's perspective, they will have been out of the game for so long, that their skills will likely have eroded.  They've become less valuable.\n\nIt seems to me that better child care is a better answer.  Help workers have a work AND a home life, rather than helping them to choose one over the other.",

We can blame the test, we can blame the curriculum, and we can blame the teachers; however; the education is out there to be had. The students who really want it and go after it do well. There are a great number of parents who see nothing wrong with the quality of education and they have raised the students to prove it. Too many excuses are afforded for failure. Teachers are not being turned out in the volume to meet the demands for a blame oriented structure called our educational system. Students are behind and are not at grade level and there are schools of thought that de-emphasize homework. Really, how badly do we want an education?",

Are the Palestinians and friends decadent or evil or just reacting in a way one would expect. \n\nIf I can feel sorry for the Palestinians, imagine how other Muslims feel. They could be  expected to retaliate. They did. Every country which has been attacked had attacked Muslims.\n\nWhat in the world did you expect the Muslims to do. I hope that the West would accept that retaliation could be expected. And since the West had killed thousands of innocents, why should the Muslims not do the same thing. Where it hurts.",

Livent went bust and the Hall was sold to a a Church at a loss. Not that different from the SoCreds lending the money taken from workers to BC Hydro to build the WAC Bennett Dam, at 2% below what Vancouver was paying for Sewer and Drain bonds, and even farther below other low risk investments at the time.\n\nMy IT employer has a policy that they will match any employee's purchase of company stock, up to 3.5% of their annual salary.

Doubtless there will be an ongoing chorus who question the authenticity of Boyden's work based on his \"lived experience\" - or lack thereof - of being First Nations.

This SECULAR moral is used as a basis in the human rights, yet grossly miss-applied as something to do with Jesus and or Christianity. Also this SECULAR misconception is magnified by the false notion that what Jesus said and taught was to not be judgmental, as we all make mistakes, do not focus on the behavior of others, but instead focus on your own behavior and attitude and let it be good.",

It gave me the impression the doctor was more interested in cranking up the billings.\n\nIf I am going to see a doctor to assess a problem, I don't think I would be comfortable with a doctor who rushes through their diagnostic exam just so they can fill up their roster with more patients.  Such a situation will bring  liability issues and malpractice lawsuits if misdiagnosis leads to something more serious.  Will the government take on such liabilities?\n\nThere is quite a difference between any other small business and a doctor's office.  In a doctor's office, only a medical professional is able to treat the patient.\n\nI don't begrudge physicians their high incomes.  It's a long road with lots to learn.

The PERA trust fund is in trouble for 3 main reasons - PERA members are living longer, economic stagnation as far as the eye can see, and legislative meddling and mismanagement.  There is a matter of fairness here, as I'll try to explain.  It is fair that employees pay more to make up for demographic change, or increased life spans.  It is fair that retirees give back some of their COLA to make up for a changing, slower growing economy.  It is also fair that employers (i.e., taxpayers) contribute more to help mitigate legislative mismanagement.  I and many others who have charted PERA's course over the years can cite many examples of mismanagement.\n\nSo, as I have outlined above, fairness dictates that all three parties contribute towards funding PERA's unfunded liability.  Employees should contribute more due to demographic change, retirees due to economic change, and employers due to mismanagement.",

There's zero evidence of wrongdoing.  So why bring up impeachment?\n\nThe events of the past year show that tradition and process are out the window.  We're in a whole new world now.  There's never been a coup attempt in the US before, there's never been a President like Trump, there's never been this kind of discord. So who knows what would happen?  I'm betting that Trump would act swiftly and decisively and the majority of his supporters (and the army) would back him.",

For example, I oppose it for the same reasons as all three county commissioners. Its not needed, it would cause enormous problems, suck up all county planning energy for years, isn't consistent with the Growth Management, and convert over 1/3 of a square mile of farmland into classic urban sprawl.\n\nInteresting Historical Fact: The term \"silent majority\" was made famous by Richard Nixon's VP Spiro Agnew. Agnew was the second VP to resign from office, but the only one to exit in disgrace. Agnew was investigated on suspicion of conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax fraud. He took a plea deal for one felony count of tax evasion that included his leaving office. Credit to Wikipedia.",
