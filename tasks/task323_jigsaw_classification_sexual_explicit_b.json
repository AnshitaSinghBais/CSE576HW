You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites.

As far as definitions go, society as a whole must through elected representatives define what various actions and scenarios violate law and what consequence to apply.  As I see it, we have trivialized sexual assault to mean anything a woman does not like.  Rarely is sexual intercourse the issue.  No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms.

Your quotation from John Jay (JJ) correctly asserts the exact opposite. Think about the prevalence of gay rape among straight prisoners. \"Opportunity\" is important.\n\nNull, it is critical to distinguish pedophilia from ephebophilia among clerical abusers. We now know pedophilia is intractable, but ephebophilia behavior is more complex. Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy. IMHO, globally the correct figure today is minimally 50%, and perhaps as high as 75%. Reliable data is virtually impossible given the ongoing preference for the closet among priests.",

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

There is some sex, drugs, or money involved here, and you better believe It !!!!!!   If this guy randomly attacked a U.S. Senator on his property, that is a 1st or 2nd degree assault.  There is a lot of sensitive information missing here and no one is talking.  Mr.Rand Paul did something wrong........\n\nFor sure.",

A photo shows a hand behind her it does not show it on her ass and it certainly doesn't show it on her bare ass... In fact it shows the opposite as the skirt would most definitely look different than it does if the back of it were being lifted AND he would have to be a freaking contortionist to touch a bare ass from that 'position' of his arm without lifting the skirt.  So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?

Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.\" \n\nLisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.\n\nLisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men.

While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

You don't GET to tell other people what their sex lives should be (you ONLY get to decide that for yourself - and so do they). The only time there is a CRIME involved is when you intrude on other people's ability to make that choice for themselves.\nWhether you do so by raping somebody or by denouncing them for choosing to be sexual its the exact same evil .

Father D. accused me and the other boy of stealing altar wine, which was not true. He told us we had two options: we could be thrown off the altar boys and expelled from school. Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked. Since I was the youngest, he chose me to be punished first. He had me lay across his lap while he proceeded to spank my bare bottom.",

I think because of modern perspectives in sex (thanks to Kinsey the quack, et al.), too many people over-emphasize the importance of sex in life.  The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to. Yet women are encouraged to be 'adult' by becoming sexualized - by having sex. How great is that? Ask, who benefits, and how.",

As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

I'm a 30 year old male. The way women dress in our society already has me breaking my neck and \"objectifying women\". Put a nice set of boobs in front of me and I know I'm going look and think sexual thoughts. Without that intention even. The woman in the article stated women should be able to be topless because men can do it. What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said \"object\". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S.",

Do not revolt against, for who will give you the fish, how will you provide for yourself? \n\n\n\nThe end of the Civil War, many slaves returned to their previous masters, sadly for generations, many knew only one life that was reliant on the one who owned them, provided for them, took care of them. Sadly. what we are seeing today is a new form of control, a new form of slavery, it's chains are economic. Why empower, educate, and lose that control, for how sad for the Masters of the new poltical plantation of enslavement",

(EDA Project Number: 07 01 07214). One of the conditions of that reimbursable grant was that the Port charge “fair commercial rental value.” While working at the Port, among other things, I was tasked with oversight of the Port’s business with the CRTC including working toward a long-term lease with the CRTC that would meet EDA approval. During this work, I discovered Port Executive Director Karen Goschen had executed a Memorandum of Understanding that committed the Port to a ten year lease with the CRTC at a rental rate below fair market value. \n\nCOMMENT PART 1",

I travel all over the nation and when people ask me where I am from and say Homer, the first thing they want to know if I know the Kilchrers. The Klichers are living a lifestyle that people have a longing for deep in their soul. To be one with nature and compromise and win without selling out to corporate America . The show has a big fan base and men like Otto and his adventures.",

An untenured prof may cost more, but not much. \nIf there really are fans for these sports, then they need to step up and provide financial support.

That school certainly isn't subsidizing it to the tune of $40,000 per athlete per year while the top skiers travel and compete nationally and internationally. Alaskans are getting little return on athletics (how many fans travel to Outside UAA/UAF events or even attend local ones?) and spending ever rarer state dollars and cutting educational programs to do it. We may not care how they do it Outside, but we don't need to make the same mistakes.",

The reason bathrooms have traditionally been segregated is that the vast majority of people don't want to be sexually harassed or ogled while going to the bathroom.

We need signed petitions for local issues, signed petitions to run for local and tribal office and signed petitions to get the attention of local governments about issues we care enough about.

It's why every time we've seen the popular vote winner lose in the electoral college, it's been a Democrat. Urban and rural citizens have different concerns, with urban voters unable to recognize the problems associated with rural living, and vice versa. That's why the electoral college is baked in to our constitution. If Democrats can't find a way to appeal to Middle-Americans instead of just leftists and foreigners, they will have to continue hoping Republicans keep putting up establishment milquetoast for the presidency like McCain and Romney to have a shot at overcoming the Electoral College.

Instead, 21% of the total earnings over 5 years are distributed 50/50 into the Earnings Reserve (ER) and the Permanent Fund Dividend distribution fund (PFD).  The ER (not including the PFD funding) is then reinvested in more liquid instruments than the Corpus of the PF does not need to be touched and can keep growing for the future.  The ER is available to the legislature (through a two-thirds consensus vote) at any time for NECESSARY government functions.  So, if they want to cover the $2.8 billion deficit with these funds this year, they can.  Do I want them to?  NO.  I want them to use a combination of cuts and ER funds to work for 3 years on reducing the ENTIRE governmental budget, regardless of UGF, DF or Administrative funding name.",

Teenage angst and hormones are real, and everything in life during those years can seem like a huge emergency or tragedy.  Kids commit suicide over test results.  For me, 26 years after graduation, I look back on tests and any singular events in high school, and realize that they have had no impact on my adult life.  If one is depressed, they may not act on their own accord.  Threatening is usually a plea for help, and someone encouraging you to kill yourself simply reinforces one's negative situation.",

Oh yeah, that's right, a whole bunch of us fell for the lie that reducing oil tax rates was going to somehow, miraculously, lead to INCREASED tax revenues, a bigger permanent fund and bigger dividends.  This announcement is just part of BP's ploy to convince Alaskans that they are not really making any money at these still  \"super low\" oil prices.  So that the state legislature should not tinker with their hard won tax law that allows them to claim credits for illusory \"losses\" and claim them and apply them to future profits when prices go back up.  And to prevent any ideas of doing any audit to see if the \"losses\" are actually real or just accounting tricks.  And a little blackmail and extortion by reducing investment and cutting jobs always helps too.  Don't fall for it.  Those of you who believe BP's false premise, wake up.  Fix the oil tax law!

One way to do this is the ancient practice whereby the pope would select the bishop from a terna presented to him by the local church.

We have projected deficits of around $1 Trillion a year, and as the debt grows, the cost of servicing the debt grows, and crowds out all other priorities.  If we can't get back to 4%+ growth consistently soon, our financial system will collapse within a few years.  The status quo is unacceptable.\n\nRand Paul gets it.

For instance, in the case of the Eastmoreland sequoia lots (a story I imagine developers and sympathizers of this article scoffed at), the neighborhood offered a very viable plan to build two smaller houses on the property without clearcutting the land, along with compensation for preserving the trees.  Such houses would have been more affordable, and saved a valuable public resource: big trees.

There is not near enough Industrial land to support a major cargo port. And it is Ugly. The cost of building is 750 million to 1 billion. Port Mak is not in the silt and does not need dredged. Good deep water and miles of Industrial land. We can do the ugly heavy lifting there.

By receiving the Eucharist, Christ unites us to his resurrected self physically and spiritually.  Why would we \"strain a gnat but swallow a camel\" by trying to equate liturgical dance to such benefits when it's right there before us staring us in the face?

Not a big deal, or use of space.\n\n2) with ADDING concourse D/E, but using them as malls, it allows for the airport to have a reason why ppl should come for longer layovers, which also help the airlines. Having ppl jump from 1 craft to another, means that the airlines can have very little slop or ppl miss flights. With a several hour layover, when somebody grabs a meal, perhaps shops, then it allows for the airlines to worry less about weather. \n\nThe fact is, that ppl DO book longer layovers at the NICE airports. For example, in the top 5 airports, they have places for kids and pets to go out, stretch legs, etc. All of the top 10, have MALLS built in the secured areas. ALL. Why? Because ppl DO Like these\n\nBy building D/E AND adding the walk tunnels underneath as Atalanta recommended, it means that ppl can move back and forth between concourses with ease and assurity.",

Consequences are handed out by people who have discretion and in truth it is those people who determine the consequences.  One must be careful in saying that choices imply responsibility for consequences as the principle covers drunk girls and drunk boys who have sex.  Both drunks made the choice to place themselves in the situation and the probable consequences are well known.  If you say the drunk girl is responsible for the consequences on these pages, you will be fried in oil, hated, scorned, etc. etc.  So the principle of responsibility itself is applied arbitrarily, i.e. in a discriminatory manner.",

The problem is what happened in China when the British East Indies Company and traders from the US got the country hooked on opium.  200 years ahead of most nations in science and tech they suddenly found themselves 200 years behind.  If you take away the drive and struggle for success and achievement you fall behind 'everyone.'  It's a major problem in the US and we are falling further and further behind other nations in almost every category.  There is no such thing as the perfect drug - PERIOD.

The bishops didn't get it, and even now, they still are unwilling to make the real changes necessary.  Yes, there needs to be a focus on preventing more abuse in the future.  But we can't forget the past.\n\nCanon Law could easily be changed, but it won't be, for the bishops rather like the system that protects them.   \n\nEven Francis, who says good words, and even tries things ( the Commission, the Tribunals) has effectively failed to make real change.  Both of those efforts have pretty much died on the vine.\n\nAt this point, this really IS about accountability, and that's simply a step too far for these guys.",

That they are in fact affordable and further, that such policies will not in fact cause the sky to fall, will not prevent the sun from rising or do damage to BC's economy. The Clone Speech is a vindication of what both the NDP and the Greens have been proposing for years now.  So thank you Christy, in your final hours as Premier, you have laid the track for your Liberal Party,  soon to be under new management, to sit in the opposition benches and vote in support of the new government's legislation agenda.  After all, you can hardly do otherwise given your Clone Speech. So let us rejoice in building a better British Columbia!  One final bit of advice Christy, please don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out!",

Obama has done a great deal to implement hope, much of which is ignored in your analysis.\n\nThe Arab Spring was a movement of hope supported by Obama, bringing democracy to millions. Unfortunately the millions used it erratically, as is often the case with democracy. See the divergent ways the US and France implemented their revolutions in the 18th century. It got messy then, and was messy more recently, but the beginning of democracy is a sign of hope.\n\nObamacare is a gift of hope for those who need healthcare. That should be everybody but there plenty who think themselves immune somehow. If Obama had acted differently on contraception, it would have been a reversal of his core objective, healthcare for all. There could have been a debate about whether contraception was healthcare, but nothing would have changed.\n\nHope still lives, despite the grumbling opposition.",

They do this by throwing the more outspoken among us to the wolves in order to signal how virtuous they are; sometimes they do this by endorsing some fatuous liberal position in order to show their willingness to compromise.  I call the latter approach the “dogshit yogurt fallacy.”  If conservatives like fruit in their yogurt and liberals prefer to eat it with dogshit, it is NOT a sensible accommodation to say: “All right.

As anyone might have guessed, the $100,000 was, is, and has turned out to be nothing more than symbolic and an empty symbol at that.  So now, that court with its absolute authority in question is threatening even more draconian measures.

These new masks sure look like they encourage a mental grey out that leads to drowning. \n.\nThis needs further investigation.

Total value of those on the open market is in the vicinity of $9,000 / year.  Contrast that with the salaries of employees and support personnel for the mine, estimated in the $7 - 10 million range for some 1,550 part and full time jobs for a generation or two.  The math is easy.\n\nIf I were PacRim, I would contract a stocking program below the mine for 50,000 smolt a year and call it good.

A potential human is not yet a full human, it is a life growing, developing towards full humanity. Since the fetus is, according to you, not yet fully a person, then the secular moral agreement that we can not take the life of persons, does NOT apply to the fetus.\n\nAu contraire, the Catholic position is that the fetus is a full human being in the most essential manner that makes humans, humans from the perspective of our theology. The fetus has been \"ensouled\" (to use an older terminology that has its own problems) and is thus immortal long before it is born.

He is a president-elect who is manifestly unfit to be president. I think Fr. Reese is right that many people have reacted to the election by moving through the stages of grief. I think it is important, though, that we don't get stuck in denial. There are two ways (at least) in which denial can get in our way as we go forward: \n1.) We can't deny the fact that this man has been elected. For sure, we need to study the election and understand what happened. But we have to accept the outcome.\n2.) We can't deny or minimize how dangerously incompetent the president-elect is. We can't indulge a thought that begins with \"Maybe it won't be so bad.\" We need to trust our Constitution and our democratic institutions, believing that they are sturdy enough to restrain and contain the worst impulses of this reckless, dangerous man. But we can't deny how dangerous he is.",

Talk is easy, doing is hard. In my experience in dealing directly with these gentlemen, many talked, very few act. Inmates must want to be reform, it can't be force upon them. Second, people who commit a felony crime, is not your average Joe. They are in sense, predators and often they preyed upon each other. Separation is needed and segregation are often required. Some one who is a clear threat to other inmates and staff are the ones who are usually lock down 23 hours. Sad but would you rather have them endangered others?

He made a special inspection of 35 schools in the prairie provinces in 1907. The experience shocked him.  Newspaper articles appeared.  In 1922, Bryce retired and wrote a book: The Story of a National Crime; Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921.  \n\nMany of the deaths were due to TB.  Bryce found on more than one occasion, that infected kids were mingled with uninfected, healthy kids. Many survivors (which means, of school life in the 1940s-1970s, told of experiences similar to what Bryce had found, decades before. Many of the healthy kids were scared to death--they felt it was a DELIBERATE strategy.  Said one: \"they wanted us dead.\"\n\nRead more on Kevin Annett's website.  Annett's word: Genocide.",

Mitt Romney on  revealing his tax returns paid approximately 2%. This guy David Cay Johnston is worth reading.

We do know our American wheat was not the same grain referred to as \"wheat\" used in those times so why are we demanding its exclusive use as long as a legitimate grain is used?

What we saw in the campaign and election was people who were not actively seeking harm to others, but were willing to accept plenty of harm or room for harm, if it was shackled to their primary objectives. They believe that because they didn't \"care\" about anything other than their own objectives, they cannot possibly be racist.

Bush 10% when he left office the unemployment rate was 4.7%. President George W Bush lost over 3 million jobs.  \n\nA 6.3% decline. Trump so far .4%.  Unemployment today is 4.3% Obama wins. \n\nAny economist will tell you that Donald Trump's economy is a direct result of Obama policy, I know you don't feel that way. It is fact.\n\nIf as you claim Trump's growth is soooo strong, why was Obama's last 5 months of job growth larger than Trump's first 5 months. So job growth declined in comparison under Trump. \n.\nShow me any legislation through congress which has changed Obama's policies.",

These are good signs that there is moe focus on saving Obamacare so long as Trump doesn't sabotage it.",

I have also seen advisors compare themselves the TSX but leaving out dividends in the benchmark to make themselves look better. Average Joe has no chance of knowing they are being manipulated.  A good place to start would be to look at SPIVA, just Google it. Standard and Poors Index vs Active and understand how most funds perform compared to the benchmark.  If your advisor does not tell you 1) what rate of return and inflation you need to achieve your goal/ plan 2) what you made after fees 3) what the benchmark made then it's likely because they don't want you to know.",

Hardly any republicans, etc.  Even then, Trump would lead in many polls in certain areas.

So he was fired because of the way he handled the release of information about Hillary and the derogatory comments he made about her after the FBI had declined criminal action.  You may remember his remarks about negligence and mishandling documents and so on-- these were the things he did wrong. So as some Republicans have said Trump fired Comey for his mistreatment of Hillary and this is like an apology and a peace gesture to her and the Democrats and putting all the email server stuff behind us.

Proof, they have never been used since WW2. I have always regarded nuclear weapons as a necessary evil as they keep great powers in check as neither regards a nuclear war a winnable war. Without nuclear weapons, that logic would change and could result in WW3. Ask yourself, would Trump show the same restraint as he does now regarding war if nuclear weapons did not exist?

Spawning a child that ate their mother, the Tea Party came to see Republicans as part of establishment politics. Compromise = bad. This message was spread throughout the land via hate-talk radio and hundreds of right wing wacko web sites (we take Visa) that still spew lies, i.e. our Muslim President, hate for liberals and RINOS.

The only way to ever fight a dangerous substance is to fight it on the demand side. As long as rural villagers need alcohol, they will get it.

Are firewood users going to spend thousands to convert to gas to then spend $3,000 to $4,000 more per winter to stay warm?LOL.  \n\nGary WIlken was the insider who used his connections to make millions when he and fellow conspirators purchased the old MUS utilities for pennies on the dollar and flipped it to an outside investor and made millions.  At the time the city mayor was Jim Hayes, a felon who got caught stealing money intended for children.\n\nFairbanks is doomed.",

Gentrification and displacement will continue if we elect yet another mayor and council member(s) who represent developer interests first. \n\nAs you observe, in Seattle all candidates will sound liberal, but most will indeed have more or less \"neo\" in the policies and actions they promote.

Today's GOP used to place the good of the country as a whole before that of single classes.  But then there were only a dozen planks in the party platform too.  To refer to those calling the shots \"leadership\" in the face of the chaos that has been legislative process is ludicrous. Add to these woes the fact that the GOP has lost the ability to govern and yes, one does have to wonder why Lisa and Dan would ever endorse the \"party line.
