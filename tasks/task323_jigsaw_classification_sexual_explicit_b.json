I think because of modern perspectives in sex (thanks to Kinsey the quack, et al.), too many people over-emphasize the importance of sex in life.  The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

Why doesn't a full term baby not quite born yet have those same rights?  Are our rights determined by which side of the vagina we're on?  Do men lose them during intercourse?",

It is not.  \n\nThe question of having sex in a way that \"avoids pregnancy\", which seems a new one in this thread, is definitely more complicated.  While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Jones was exposed as a liar for saying Clinton's penis had a deformity, and Willey lied under oath repeatedly to Ken Starr's investigators. None has ever provided a shred of evidence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations",

I've had more than one friend who was sexually assaulted by a brother growing up, and in my extended family, one brother orchestrated a gang rape of his own brother.  Maybe because of my history, in my own family there were lines of privacy around intimate body care that were never disturbed or questioned, so I can imagine being uncomfortable with the situation LW described.",

NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.

He's had innumerable girl friends, mistresses and victims. He described his efforts to avoid venereal disease while living a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle as his \"personal Vietnam.\" In that context, he described himself as a \"great and very brave soldier\" -- a manifestation of his contempt for real soldiers. He's a racist and a fascist who mocks the handicapped and attacks women.  The fact that some putatively pro-life and pro-family voters have glommed on to him demeans and disgraces those causes, and the fact that some members of the Catholic clergy are giving cover to vote for him is a lasting stain on the church.",

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites.

What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

No, this is normative developmental and universal sexual behavior.  And by universal I that means that it is practiced by all human beings at one time or another in their lives.  And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

These ideas, promulgated by heretics and paganss, were taken up by Christian ascetics who also distrusted pleasure. Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture. It is a wholly man-made concept, stemming from the thought that sex is nasty.\n\nRD trots out the standard traditionalist twaddle in support of this.",

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to.

Yeah, he had a criminal record that wasnt very good but HE'S NOT A RAPIST AT ALL!!! Actually he is one of the best people i have ever met, he was the only one who protected me from my extremly abusive boyfriend. \n     Joshua Wesley Sherman is my BEST FRIEND. Yeah, his record is bad also but the Lane County Legal system is cruel and unusual. Most everything they claim he did wasnt true. They just pinned him guilty by making it his only option.\n  They tell you the details they want to but they arent telling you EVERY DETAIL. Joshua wasnt present when the crime was commited he has an alibi but they silenced her. If the TRUTH came out maybe it wouldnt go unnoticed when the police do faulty ass shit.",

Father D. accused me and the other boy of stealing altar wine, which was not true. He told us we had two options: we could be thrown off the altar boys and expelled from school. Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

The Orthodox Liturgy is about what hasn't even happened yet--the transfigured world.

When you receive communion, you are receiving the transfigured Christ. Some people may argue the finer points and there may be some variation from region to region but it has been said many times about the two liturgies--one seems forever centred on Calvary; the other on Pascha. \n\nThere is some parting of ways on the whole notion of atonement too, mostly a reaction to Anselm, but then, there are some Orthodox thinkers who think Anselm's ideas are correct. One thing for certain: you will always get lots of disagreement within the Orthodox church.",

The offending rate for blacks was almost 8 times higher than whites, and the victim rate 6 times higher\" (I'm sure you can confirm those numbers Mr. Statistics).  He also said that it's insulting to suggest solutions of weaning off welfare, education, jobs, and family values (more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock) as these fixes are myths perpetuated by racists (like me apparently).

Most notably T-34 tanks and MIG fighters with swept-back wings, which the USAF didn't have until later in the war. Some of the MIGs were flown by Russian pilots. Subsequently the UN forces were forced to retreat and North Korea was reestablished as a communist state, with Chinese support.

Why were tougher rules put in place if they just turn around and give these same people an additional loan to cover their down payment and put them even further into debt?\n\nI'd love to live somewhere like Monaco, but just like a 20 year old in Toronto trying to buy a million dollar house, I CAN'T AFFORD IT!!!.

The United States with ten times the Canadian population has the strongest economy in the world, so that theory is easily debunked. \nSecondly, Canadians no longer have large families by choice. Fifty years ago, it was not unusual for couples to have between eight and fourteen children, especially in Quebec. But as women became educated and chose to enter the workforce, they no longer wanted large families. So immigration is the only way to increase the population. \nAnd increase it, we must to retain the taxpayers' base necessary to sustain the social programs Canadians want.",

Who knows what lies ahead for the children of \nboxed-in two parent, white bread families. Some of them are in fact gay. Some of them are in fact trans.

While it makes me sick to my stomach that those poor dogs were so neglected that they likely died from it, and a third is in less than perfect shape, it seems something is seriously wrong with Murphy.  She was reported to have health problems and someone was concerned enough to call in for a welfare check. The police find her home in deplorable condition, w/2two dead dogs inside  No mention of what the dogs died from. They track her down at her office where she has been living with her 34d dog, who had urinated inside. What do the police do? Arrest her.  Do me a favor: Never ask the police to do anything for me.

In a time of cheap oil, plastic bottles aren't recycled but end up in landfills or cast into the environment. Even in times when it is more expensive, less than 40% of these billions of single usage bottles are ever recycled. That's a huge amount of wasted plastic. Combine that with the energy it takes to transport water at seven pounds per gallon, distances of thousands miles(Fiji water actually comes all the way from Fiji!) and we waste vast resources and create a huge amount of solid waste. It is also ridiculous to spend five dollars a gallon on water  which is usually the same quality that can be purchased locally for around twenty dollars for a thousand gallons. Buy inexpensive reusable bottles, fill them from the tap. If you are concerned for some reason about water quality, buy a water filter.

That is all in sandstone & shale, acid is used to etch carbonates in lieu of proppants. \n\nIt is all in accord with Darcy's Law for flow in permeable media - the flow rate is proportional to the drive pressure & inversely proportional to the flow distance & permeability. Drive energy is a given {water injection apart}, permeability cannot be altered, except by acid in the very near-wellbore area, so stimulation is done by changing the flow regime from radial to parallel flow, reducing the distance the fluid needs to travel.",

This is to prevent powerful nations like Germany in the case of Czechoslovakia and Russia in the case of Eastern Ukraine, from taking over smaller countries,\n\nThe second reason is that a great majority of Hawaiian subjects rejected the idea of annexation by signing the ku'e petitions and submitting them to the US Congress.\n\nThere was also the question of the legitimacy of the Republic of Hawaii since it was an unelected government which directly resulted from a coup d'etat.",

From that point until October of 2002 there was no UN inspector presence on the ground in Iraq so a lot of suspicions went unchecked. After October of 2002 however the foremost weapons inspections teams in the world operating under the authority of the United Nations scoured the country and disproved all the suspicions.

The hypothesis that governments require \"consent of the governed\" is actually a testable hypothesis.  It's demonstrably false.  I can give you obvious examples of governments existing that do not have the \"consent of the governed\" and you would probably agree with me (North Korea, for example).  But even using America, or literally any country on the planet, I can demonstrate that it isn't consensual.  Governments have always existed, long before \"consent of the governed\" was ever thought of.\n\nGovernment is force.  Tihs is just a plain fact.  If it's government, it's not consensual by definition.  If there is no force involved, then it's not a real government.  \"Consent of the governed\" is an oxy-moron.  It would be like saying \"consent of the rape victim\" because we took a vote and gave the rapist the \"right\" to rape his victim and called that consent.  Logically absurd.",

In a government created through \"rep by pop\" parties with fewer seats will ensure that the \"government party\" keeps its shoulder to the wheel and delivers on promises and commitments.  The $200,000?  To be used by the organization Fair Vote Canada to spread the rep by pop word throughout Canada, and the current ministry of government institutions to train every Canadian in the ways and means of \"rep  by pop\".\nDirk Smit\nWindsor",

The guess at the rate of return is how much to credit to each account.  If there is too much money,  from good investments and markets,  the employees get the overage,  or have in the past.  If the rate of return does not make the estimated return,  the taxpayers via public employers,  all of which are tax supported,  have to pony up the difference between the expectation and the reality.  Damned if you do,  and damned if you don't.\n\nSo the jackboots of public employee unions and lawyers are stepping hard in the throats of every citizen of Oregon,  on behalf of a small minority that got a windfall two decades ago,  with overheated markets,  and when those crashes occurred,  continued to believe a windfall every year was their entitlement.

I don't think many deny that CO^2 will lead to or is at least correlated with rising temps. It's the hypothesized feed-backs that amplify the predicted increases up to 4x (4 degrees v 1 degree) that are the points of contention. The feed-backs are not observed and the models have repeatedly failed to predict. Regardless, even if it was warming 1 degree or even 3 degrees by 2100, what should we do about it? De-industrialize?

Imagine how many picks he'd throw vs a hitting team that also would be sending cruise-missile blitzes at him all game long? Ugly.\nWilson appeared to me to be the future. He had that \"x\" factor that jumps out: a quickness that cannot be learned. A \"live\" arm from which the ball appears to rocket. Quickness, not just straight-line speed--- overall rapidity in all action.\nOf course, if Hoke's D indeed takes major, major steps to the point of being Stanford-like---- it could be an interesting year. The key will be in limiting offensive errors and not giving up bunches of throwing scores",

Current Republicans have gutted that Act. Since 1965 the GOP has set a pretty low bar for Democrats to cross to look less racist than Republicans. Every Republican president after Ike has used the Southern Strategy to get elected, appealing to white racists. That is why they have kicked off their campaigns by going to Philadelphia, Mississippi. Its other significance is being were Swerner, Goodman, and Cheney were lynched for registering black voters. The local white people love the attention. Democrats want us to vote. That is more than I can say for the majority of Republicans. Democrats are just the lesser of two evils. The GOP has become a white identity party in my opinion.

Hell, if Alaska went entirely carbon-free overnight, it would be years, more likely decades, before that difference alone would be noticed--and that's assuming everything else stayed the same, which it obviously wouldn't.  You'd have to take a lot of carbon out of the air to stop seas from rising.\n\nSo, Margaret, even if Alaska's Three Stooges are wickedly refusing to face the facts and admit the problem, what difference does that make to Alaska?

Bottom line, the Federal Government has set the rules as to what they are willing to stomach when it comes to what the City's plans are to obtain new funding for the program. \n\nNow with those rules set, what do the candidates have to say? What novel new ideas do you have to address it with these new rules in place.. \n\nOr are we just going to continue hearing from one side that the other guy is to blame and to elect him, instead to fix the whole problem? Nice way to campaign for a City Council seat, but I think the electorate, with this development, want to hear about real plans - even if that means we are going back hat in hand to the Legislature for a further extension of the GET.

Day in and day out these very brusque captains of industry would give me short shrift and often hang up the phone.  Your Dad on the other hand was very patient and courtly in an almost old world way.  Over time I got to meet him a number of times and to this day remember him as a great gentleman.

From 1974 until 1995 I was part-owner of E Noa Tours and the Waikiki Trolley (I am happy to say the company is still very active in its 42nd year).  We were a regulated Common Carrier of passengers by the State PUC.  We carried over 1 million people per year, and we had over 50 vehicles and 100 drivers. Ridership was the lifeblood of a private company like E Noa.  I have brought the topic of rail ridership to the attention of the city council.  Low ridership will kill this project.  The majority of rail riders (according to HART) will come from the bus - that is, they will be forced to transfer to rail (their bus routes will be changed to become \"Feeder\" routes for rail).  Our current mayor has never discussed this fact with the public including our bus riders.  He is misleading us by omitting this fact.",

Incredibly, the main criticism of the study’s conclusions take the opposite tack, that in this already undersized sample of non-citizens, most or all who said they voted were actually non-citizens, falsely indicating that they had committed a felony, when actually they hadn’t.

You need a place to live, and in that sense you are not getting \"wealthier\" merely by staying in the market.\nThe focus on the likes of Toronto or Vancouver is quite misleading, nobody is forcing people - young, old, immigrant - to live there. There are many smaller cities where housing costs remain reasonable in an environmetn of low traffic congestion, clean air and still all the facilities ( e.g. \"shopping\"  .-). Takes a bit of strategic planning - by way of example I had a challenging professional career, always lived in a rural environment and my normalized housing costs were about 1/2 of the likes of \"Toronto\"( been there ). Never mind an easy commute, clear skies and park like environment.\nA second thought - the Mc Mansions of today are of far better quality, huge by comparison to housing say 50 years ago. Anything over 1000 - 1500 square feet is a waste of space, not knocking it but not necessary.",

Because you never know when a family member or friend over doses or when the child of a friend, co-worker or realative over doses. Drug addiction is a very tough addiction to beat. Drug users can go undetected until a tragic over dose occurs. Often drug addicts resort to theft or prostitution in order to support their habit even if the once had good jobs or attended school because of the spiral downwards. Sometimes violence is involved either by the addict or the addict being victimized. There is a emotional reason to care as well as a financial cost/burden to the public.

However, the anthropogenically-sourced ~43% increase in the CO₂ mixing ratio was an abrupt departure from the millions-of-years period of stability before industrialization, and clearly began after that period, not 300 years ago. The highest rates of increase have occurred since the mid 20th century.\nThe ranges of ECS values given in the IPCC ARs have actually been remarkably consistent. 1 through 3 had the ranges as 1.5ºC-4.5ºC. The AR 4 slightly increased only the lower limit of the range to 2ºC-4.5ºC. The AR 5 brought the range back to that of ARs 1-3, at 1.5ºC-4.5ºC.

Gloves separate your fingers so they get cold. Use a scarf and try to breathe with your mouth closed so you aren't sucking that cold air into your lungs.\n To keep your place warm shovel snow up against the walls as high as you can. Close your curtains. Roll up a blanket or a rug and shove it up against the bottom of the door. Get some shrink wrap window kits and cover your windows. If there's cold air coming in through the electrical outlets put a piece of duct tape over them. Bring in a couple extra armloads of stovewood so you don't have to open the door and let the cold in.

What you might not know is that many people with an IQ higher than 25 but lower than the normal range struggle to identify right or wrong in some contexts. \n\nLet's suppose your brother says John is bad and has threatened to hurt him, and asks you to kill John. As a person of presumably normal intelligence, we can count on you to reliably determine that killing John is not right in those circumstances. People with intellectual disabilities cannot always make that determination, and might easily decide doing what their brother asked was the right thing.\n\nBy the way, let's say you know John served time for several past murders, and you overheard a phone conversation in which he said he was going to kill your brother tonight. You have a chance to kill John and save your brother and get away with it. Is killing him right or is it wrong?",

With student loans, part time work and scholarships, higher education is accessible to virtually anyone willing to put in the effort. From there, work hard for your employer.

If those valves were to be shut off quickly, the pipeline could burst somewhere upstream of each valve.\nAre the people operating TAPS cognizant of the potential danger? Even if TAPS isn't hard-wired into the N. American fiber-optic system, there are still the satellite connections. And if the NSA attack tools have already infected TAPS, they could be set to trigger as soon as any remotely activated controls are taken off-line.\nWere I in charge, I would immediately have all shut-off valves physically blocked from activating, except by manual override. That alone would prevent the worst of damage.\nThen what about the smaller pipelines? The inlet platforms? What else?",

The company that actually provides the drilling rig and drills the hole is also hired by the E&P company. \n\nMy greatest success as an investor was buying shares in an E&P company that was \"losing\" money -- until it didn't -- leading to a '22 bagger'. \n\nDO pursue your quest to understand the importance of cash flow re E&P companies in O&G sector. Failing this, and if you are somewhere in the 20 to 25 age group, you could join the long line of farm hands who are lined up for better paying jobs on the rigs. Be warned; the learning curve is short and sharp.",

The notion that aboriginal existence is \"criminalized\" is so tangential as to come across to most Canadians as amounting to proof of a victim mentality. Sure, indigenous peoples were mistreated in the past, with \"status Indians\" being excluded from full citizenship and not being permitted to vote until 1960. And there's no doubt that indigenous peoples are forced to live in a world built by their colonizers. But this can be argued to be the case throughout most of the world, where Western influence has been pervasive for more than a century. It's not unique to Canada. Cloaking a community or culture in an eternal shroud of victimization isn't likely a healthy or productive basis on which to build a future.",

The voters trusted the Republican-led Legislature would act on their initiative to:  Build the Gas Pipeline.  Governor Walker hasn't or isn't about to let us down.  It's the Republican majority and Big Oil that've blocked building the gas pipeline.  When the last drop of oil is gone (25%), what new revenue do you propose to replace Prudhoe Bay?

Hollywood is at the very heart of big money, sex, glamour, power and liberal politics.  They are anything but conservative. They mock values and traditions that made America  a beacon to the whole world. Hollywood has  replaced that  beacon  with a 'red light'  that advertises  a message of depravity, replacing the ideals of freedom and liberty with 'money, sex and power'  We have, by and large, been co-opted by Hollywood and liberal politics\nPresident Trump is not a 'known' sex harasser. Every single woman who came forth last fall, as if on 'cue', backed off when they could see it wasn't working.  Weinstein, on the other hand admits to it and has a tape with him engaging in it.  Like the 'blue dress' in Monika's closet, it can't be refuted.  \"Allegations\" must be proven. Not one has been proven in Donald Trump's case.  Please stop slandering the President.",
