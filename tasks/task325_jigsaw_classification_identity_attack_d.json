When asked why he was running much higher deficits than he promised during the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau said: “If you actually want to do the math, we talked about $10 billion worth of deficit in our first year. It became $30 billion. But there were still only about $10 billion or $11 billion worth of new spending. It was the economic situation that fell out.” Actually, the current backcast for the 2016-17 deficit is $23B, but Trudeau is probably too clueless to know this. Anyway, his contention that only the deterioration of the economic situation kept him from fulfilling his promise is groundless.",

There are more priests imported from Africa and some from India, when even in their home countries there are not enough priests for their own burgeoning Catholic populations.  \n\nWhile the ordination of priests has been reduced in many countries and increased in others, world wide the Catholic population has grown, increasing the ratio of priest to laity dramatically.  JPII and BXVI together led the Church for 35 years and left the Church in a very poor position with respect to the number of priests.

Now, it could be US senators/congressmen are all stunned and dazed by Trump craziness, but, surely SOMEBODY down there would be doing more than advising the Pentagon to \"review\" Norsat contracts. If the mighty a- red-under-every-bed US ain't worried...why are we?",

The pecking order works like this: Gay women create cliques and take over the business. Straight women are second class citizens. People of color (gay or not) are 3rd class citizens.

It always comes back to the all celibate male clergy and their reasons for accepting ordination.  \n\nI am always amazed at the average pew sitter's inability to understand why this Church can't move forward on the clergy abuse crisis.  For once, it's only partially about the money.  For too many practicing  Catholics it's about the sacramental magic and their own soul and avoiding hell.  Hence the official Catholic line from prelates like Wuerl about the Gingrich's:  \"They both went to confession.\"   As long as the 'confession card' can be played by adulterous heterosexuals, gay Catholics don't stand a chance versus the hetero norm.",

We have to have the confidence to believe what we are actually seeing in our practices and speak out. Every family doctor who has ever been on call has received calls at 5:30pm on a Friday night from people asking for narcotics as soon as their own doctor is off call. The signs were all there. But there was no mechanism by which those of us who disagreed could make our voices heard. The consensus conferences of the 1990s never recorded dissenting views.

I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day…I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”\n\n Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate.\n\nTrump has repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists”, plans to build a border wall & force Mexico to pay for it, repeatedly referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” due to her Cherokee ancestry, called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the US\n\n(cont'd below)....",

It doesn't work and never will.  50 years of leftist policies haven't helped, and have instead given us a president Trump.

Ontario's government expenditures in 2016 are roughly $130 billion.

She held on to her factional support but probably only out of courtesy. \n\nI don't see Ron Kouchi or the other Majority leadership mentioned likely suffering at all.

Some of these deaths would happen even if the nation had sensible gun laws. Many would not. \n\nThe research that exists increasingly shows there are effective measures that reduce gun deaths without materially infringing on law-abiding people’s liberty: deny firearms to domestic abusers, for example; perform serious background checks on would-be gun buyers; require that gun owners obtain a license. Such measures...would make society safer. \n\n—So, About That ‘Good Guy’ With A Gun \nWashington Post 7/12",

The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner. \n\nOn average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”",

Solid accounts by rare seminary or chancery personnel underline this reality. Yes, concupiscence is a function of humanity, so let's start such conversations by being compassionate and, where required, forgiving. But we must also acknowledge that the sideways living of enough priests, and the bishops who manage them and who themselves live less than integrated lives, give cover to those in their ranks who engage in criminal, and not merely immoral, behavior.

The bishops do not give a sh#7 about their priests or their people - there are very few I would consider even remotely connected to the Good Shepherd. \n\nHonestly, I do not see the macho/heterosexual brawny culture that Fr Reese references in the article. Quick the contrary, bishops running around with their  boy-toy sycophants. Talk about a gay culture. Of course all that sexual energy is tied up into the exercise (sometimes brutal) of power and an affinity for raising large sums of money for their special projects.",

The Bank of Canada's inflation calculator says that we went up 214.79% in that span, so that a dollar worth in 1954 cost $314.79 by 1980. In that time, a typical mid 1950's house in Vancouver worth $10,000 rose to around $100,000 for a roughly 1000% gain. My parents place went up far more than that due to land speculation. Contrast that with the Dow Jones index, which was at 292.39 in January 1954 and rose to 875.85 in Jan 1980, essentially just matching inflation, nothing more. You got some dividends from the Dow, but you paid tax on that and on the capital gain if you sold the stocks.  In comparison,  you got to live in the house, were more easily able to leverage it via a mortgage and got a huge tax free gain that vastly exceeded inflation. Any wonder that people prefer real estate?",

In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for \"shaming\" the family.",

My understanding is that it was youth from the community that went door to door to in an effort to convince government to move forward with the bike lane.

It only involves situations or actions that a particular person does not like.  Frankly, this disgusts me.  Someone is assaulted in a violent way which means via physical force in some manner, we must protect them.  Someone experiences something they don't like, well, so what.

And I had none of my usual outlets for surviving — or thriving — in the cold. Local ski trails were grassy. Walking routes were glazed in ice. Without snow, I ran out of ways to coax my children outside so that we all wouldn't go crazy. I unfurled an old tarp across our steep, green backyard and sent them down it in sleds. That held their interest for 30 minutes.\n\nI'd always bragged to folks Outside that in Alaska we enjoyed a \"reliable\" winter. But as they got buried in successive snowstorms on the Eastern Seaboard for the second year in a row, nothing seemed reliable about our winter. It wasn't winter at all.

Whether or not a Rite is valid is not BECAUSE a pope said so, it is for the circumstances for which it is declared so.  An invalid form is invalid no matter what century we live in.  So the question begs asking, are any of the \"presbyters\" installed using the new \"Rite\" validly ordained?  And if not, they can't confect the sacraments.

But if you make the choice for better produce and live food then these big grocery chains are going to lose every time. Natural Grocers, Whole Foods, Alfalfa's, Sprouts they all blow the old chains out of the water when it comes to organic produce with a good selection. If Kroger wants to make a profit, sell decent food, same goes for Safeway and Walmart. I have a plant based diet and I find very little that is suitable at Kings, Safeway, Walmart or Target.

Physics and reaction time have more to do with vehicle spacing, which is better when vehicles are travelling more or less at the same speed instead of wildly varied ones driven by partial compliance with artificially low limits.\n\n\"If a low speed limit is posted on a road designed for higher speeds, enforcement problems will be considerable. This occurred on many Interstate highways under the NMSL. When speed limits were raised by 10 mph (16 km/h) on sections of qualified rural Interstate highways in 1987, average traffic speeds increased much less than the change in the speed limit immediately following the change.\"\n\nhttp://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr254.pdf",

And what you say about illegal aliens turning in others because they have no fear of being deported is garbage. Prove it .Obama said he would withhold Federal funds for States not following his \"bathroom\" rules. Where was your outcry? It's not racism. its safety.  How many more Americans are you willing to harm by protecting criminal illegal aliens?   Who in your family are you willing to sacrifice?",

Where Trump is concerned, other than a couple of instances where Trump can definitely be accused of being heartless and mean, his actual dealings with women have been mostly positive and aboveboard. I do not understand how you truly believe that Trump is actually a \"practiced, serial abuser\" of women and lived a life in the spotlight for all these years, when there is no actual credible accusation of that.

However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

In their native countries they would be raped and murdered for not wearing them. Islam as it exists today is a pestilence on humanity. Of course there are many wonderful people who are Muslims. There were a lot of charming German Nazis too. But Muslims belong to a cult whose basic tenant is that anyone who is not Muslim is sub-human and can be enslaved and murdered with impunity. That is a fact. It is a cult which deems women as property belonging to men - first their father and brothers, then their husband. If those men decide the behavior of a woman has dishonored them they are free to murder her. The worst problem with Islam today is that it encourages women to have as many babies as possible.",

And Mead called the police because his victim defended himself after being attacked. Poor baby didn't like a dose of his own medicine! Prince Charming ladies!! Run, Michelle RUN!!",

Anti-abortion activism (8 per cent) and nationalism/separatism (7 per cent) rounded out the list, while in 40 per cent of cases there was no clear ideological motivation.\n\n\"The threat from the far right in Canada is real,\" Ryan Scrivens, one of the new report's authors and PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University, told VICE News. \"It doesn't get the same kind of attention and publicity that Islamic extremist groups get, but they have, historically, done more damage in Canada.\"",

The friend and other kid made it out of the store with their stolen goods.  My son knew better and stuffed his items behind a rack on his  way out of the store.  The three then proceeded to go behind the mall facility and spray paint graffiti on the mall wall.  A security guard saw what was happening and nabbed all three by the nap of their neck and took them into his office.  Parents were called.  All three were banned from the mall for a year.  They were allowed back into the mall if they were with a parent.  My son cried his eyes out not because he was associated with his friends stealing from a store, but because he knew his behavior was wrong and I'd be disappointed.  He was right.",

Mr. Trump is Mr. Trump.  He brought to the Presidency all those personal traits and values he's developed and displayed throughout his life.  Additionally, he's been very clear that he sees his election as validation of those values.  He was elected because of who he is and what he is, whether you or I like it or not.  Any changes in his approach to life or to others or to the responsibilities of his office will come from \"without\" not from \"within.\"  \n\nI think many Americans, very optimistically, hoped the Office would change the man.

If the City thinks thousands of people can enjoy a music festival on the golf course for one weekend a year that could be a good use of the land.  No golfing for about a week doesn't seem like a big deal.

American society stinks because it has never reconciled and made reparations for its racist past because mainstream white Americans are feeble-minded, obedient consumers and not much else. \nThe stench too comes from the corruption of Americans ignoring the fanaticism and terrorism of far-Right racists and misogynists, abdicating power to them in the guise of protecting religion.\nHillary Clinton is better than most Americans because she's a fighter, an intellectual workhorse, she knows her enemies and generally takes no prisoners. It's more than you can say about Obama who was always capitulating to his enemies, treating them like friends when they were calling him \"nigger.\" Obama preferred not to get his hands dirty and so accomplished less than he could have. \nThe reality is that American men are psychologically uncomfortable with the idea of a woman in power.

We cannot disregard these teachings under the guise of discernment. The laity in general does not have this charism and experience has shown us, they fail time and time again by mistaking their own wants with the will of God.\n\nWe cannot ignore the truth that those who are not free to marry are committing adultery in their new marriage and if this sin is done with full knowledge and free will, they are not disposed to receive the Eucharist. What the Pope has done is say one thing, but then send a wink and a nod over to those who want to receive but cannot. \n\nThis is leading people into sin. This is not what a good pastor does.",

Both straight/gay alike who want' to act on sexual tendencies, are, hence, both called to lead celibate chaste lives. The Church specifies deep-seated homosexual behaviors as they differ. When a man sleeps with say a woman, they generally have a child - most often/common. Deep seated homosexual don't result in having to raise a child/children. Since people with preference of same gender cannot have children together. So the Church explicitly points out these actions do not follow from Christ's birth. Nor the necessity of life for Baptism.

He missed three years when he was stripped of his title and denied his opportunity to compete while he was in his absolute prime. Many of his most memorable fights happened after the Supreme Court unanimously overturned his bogus conviction on draft evasion. Opposing the Vietnam War, advancing social justice, and bringing attention to the oppression of black people were far more important to Ali than merely being The Greatest. For him, being The Greatest involved using his platform to change society for the better, even at the cost of many more victories in the ring, millions of dollars, and the temporary approval of \"mainstream\" society. I agree with your evaluation of Bennett being a five star prospect  for his post-football life, but it's smart on his part to use his 15 minutes (relatively speaking) of fame, to bring attention to issues more important than football.",

The NY Times did the same thing in 2014 and nobody cares. Every single wealthy person in the country has done the exact same thing at one time or another and nobody cares unless it is Trump who has done it. Hillary is extremely careless with classified information and the left does not care, Trump does something legal and proper and is excoriated by the left.

If women actually are seen as representing God then men are really not 'separate but more equal', which is what their identity has largely been built on. They are actually then 'less equal' in their own eyes because they can't give birth.

Not expensive per se, but burdensome.  The reason, of course, that offenses not worth the effort/cost should not serve to deprive a citizen of freedom.  Murder, rape, etc. will always be core serious crimes.  Many other crimes, the drug crimes, minor shoving matches, etc. etc. are often of no real consequence, but the criminal justice system is involved because 1) prosecution is no skin off the citizen's teeth, 2) the system feeds many and must have meat to grind.\n\nTwo: In the multiple crime scenario, some triage may not be so bad.  But I do not think that most plea bargains are in that category.  More likely a man will be charged with felony kidnapping for holding the door for 30 seconds during an argument.  This, of course, is obscene abuse of the kidnapping statutes, but such a charge will instantly force a plea giving its massive sentences.",

We seem to be experiencing a significant increase in seemingly concerted hijacking by coteries of disrupters, and individuals of persistent evidence of either ill will or obdurate attempts to exclude legitimate discussion. Many of the posts themselves might warrant a \"sort of\" by those of us who are sort of tolerant and, be given the benefit of the doubt as \"civil\" individually. Taken in their successive, persistent and even strategic context they are an attempt to further an agenda that seems clearly antithetical to minimum standards of civil discourse.

Problem is, having a gun usually makes the first attempt lethal.

Assad has had great \"success\" employing these against his civilian population: between March 2011 to March 2016, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (http://sn4hr.org/) notes the Syrian regime and its backers were responsible for 188,000 civilian deaths or 92% of the total.

Australia legally requires that eligible citizens vote.  Maybe we should do the same here.  \n\nBut most of all, we need to teach basic civics to children and somehow reinforce that for adults.  Maybe include a basic civics test when people applied for a drivers license.  Or require people to re-register to vote every five or ten years and the re-registration includes a one-hour basic civics course everyone was required to take.  But most of all teach young people about how our system of government works, the three branches of government, checks and balances, rights and civic responsibilities.  \n\nSounds simplistic but we aren't doing whatever it is we need to do.",
