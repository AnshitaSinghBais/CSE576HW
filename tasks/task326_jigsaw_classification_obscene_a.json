The wearing of a veil is still rare in Canada and terms like \"mass immigration\" are meaningless. What quantity is \"mass\"? What reduction in the current immigration levels would mena that it is no longer \"mass\".

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola. My guess is that STASI contacted the Cubans and the Cubans conspired with Noriega to seize the freight. I wouldn't be surprised if Noriega then sold the cargo to the CIA.

And yet it seems sex wasn't the power they held, weirdly enough we hear a lot about past \"shotgun weddings\", let me tell you something poor women worked, dad was liable to fund them until they married and yet there was were shotgun weddings concentrated.\nAnd yet a lot of wedlock kids happened with kids who still saw their daddies and were directly supported by them but mom wanted nothing with dad. So it seems women were still fucking for the reason they always fucked, fucking itself. Women lined up the docks for the same reasons girls line up the sports block, to see hot men who are there to work not please them sexually.",

If Oahu can not care for the outer islands, it is long overdue for the outer islands to be granted the right, and share of state funds, to care for themselves.\n\nWe have seen this inequity played out time and time again. From our schools to our infrastructure needs. Our healthcare facilities lack, our environmental concerns are not protected, we are not protected from invasive species, but damn Oahu gets its rail. At some point there's got to be a reckoning. \n\nThank you Russell.",

That crap was everything from being sent to detention for not wanting to sing Christmas songs praising Jesus as a part of a required Christmas pageant, to being told pointedly that I would fail a class if I missed a day for the Jewish High Holidays.  Those holidays happen early enough in the school year that there is no way I wouldn't be able to make up the work, but since the teacher had scheduled a test for that day, with no way to make it up, I was out of luck as far as he was concerned.  Thankfully, my parents are both incredibly pushy and managed to make most of the problems go away without resorting to suing.\n\nAs for the Christmas songs, I would have been fine if they had been the secular Rudolph and Santa type songs, but not full on religious ones.",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

Hey, Dana Altman, you recruited a player who was under investigation for sexual assault at his previous school and then you either lied about knowing this or were incompetent for not knowing. Your pathetic and embarrassing press conference after those three players were kicked out was the epitome of ignorance about the realities of rape and sexual assault that women face. Now you want to play it off as people just didn't believe in you? Go to hell, you selfish bastard! 1 in 4 women will be raped in their lifetimes. 1 in 10 women at the U of O will be raped in their time at university--this is a true horror.

If Pakistan plays games they have had good teachers in the CIA and other shady colleagues in the US establishment. Do not forget Mr. Bin Laden was a US trained operative. Do not forget the US's role in the killing of Allende of Chile,  Mosaddaq of Iran and the millions who have died courtesy of US interventions in Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq and Indonesia to name a few. Mr. Rogan get your facts right. Nobody trusts the US. Sadly an empire in decline always has its former allies turn against it. Pakistan is merely following Machiavelli's principals of doing just enough to get the hegemon/ bully off its back. Don't expect Pakistan or any of your allies to do much more. Oh and don't bore us with stories of billions given to Pakistan. That is utter bullshit. They have paid of dictators and politicians with no benefit to the host country.",

It argues for allowing opinion, even on a hot topic.   (Especially on a hot topic, I'd say.)  \"Cultural appropriation: Why can't we debate it?\" she asks.  Well, the 253 comments before this one have been doing exactly that, so I guess that's her question answered.  But is anybody in this thread going to lose their job because of the views expressed here?  Not if their name is Retrofit, apparently.  So, why are people losing their jobs over this?  Because a smallish group of angry people disagree with their opinion?  Were Niedzvieki, Kay and Ladurantaye guilty of hate speech?  Is that why they lost their jobs?  No?  Then why did they lose their jobs over being part of a debate?

It's pretty typical to assume that if you let an opponent get a shot off, they stand a very high chance of getting hits, and with high damage output per hit. Wargames are not usually intended to be easy on the blue force. Real history is much more complex, and much smaller carriers than we have today absorbed huge amounts of damage in WWII.\n\nIn the exercise, a 40 year old missile design was assumed, just based on being launched within range and with decent location intel, to score a large number of hits and do massive amounts of damage, when history shows both the reality of being able to intercept these missiles, and of large vessels to withstand the damage from them.\n\nThere's nothing from Millennium Challenge indicating carriers are obsolete. Only that unconventional thinking is, as always, a potential game changer if you're not on your toes. Gen. Van Riper proved he has that skill.",

They have done all of Hawaii's taxpayers a great injustice and continue to project a cloud of corruption, self interest and discontent concerning the rail. Fortunately CB provides an avenue for all to voice opinions and more importantly inform the public on events that affect us.

The South declared its right to secede, but in the Confederate Constitution hey outlined the \"Confederacy\" as a “permanent federal government,” and outlawed secession.

Whether or not their complaint of unfairness had a basis,  from the outset the city has played politics by accusing households of wasting water allegedly watering their gardens and pools and shaming residents, incl those who had undetected leaks; for not taking action per restrictions against non-household users; in the initial period, granting exemptions of restrictions to a certain class of users to water their gardens and fields; for a lack of transparency and questionable information about overall consumption and their own culpability in their development-at-all-cost approach, which in its way, contributed to water high demand.\nNo one is blaming the city for the drought, but at every opportunity their poor management must be stated until they acknowledge some blame.",

After all we only have hundreds of thousands of miles of pipelines that have been operating successfully & safely for almost a hundred years.  Nothing new here.\nYet... without a word or regulatory hearings  this carbon spewing industry (yes... that's what cars are) gets to build an expanded plant----WITH  government money!!!!\nWhere are the protestors, all the Indians demanding their share, people pleading they have the right to block this development because of social license??   What a bunch of BS double standard hypocrites.\n\nSo what's different,  Could it be that it's Ontario and poor Alberta has the oil?",

Consider as well the population of Canada, and the possible number of mentally challenged individuals , and then the number of mass killings that occur. This doesn't excuse it , make it go away, or make it any less horrific. But to make the leap that all of Canada has a problem, or that all of Canada has to question whether we are racist because of the actions of one man, just isn't right.

Taken together, the healthcare plan and budget would accomplish exactly what Trump intends them to accomplish: a massive tax cut for the very wealthiest among us. Meanwhile, Trump's pro-death policies will, if enacted, lead to more abortions, more infant mortality, more maternal deaths, more sickness, more death.

Then I googled SSJD, and read:\n\n\"The Sisterhood of St. John the Divine is a contemporary expression of the religious life for women within the Anglican Church of Canada. We were founded in Toronto on September 8th, 1884.\"\n\nBingo. This ungracious, ill-informed, uncivil gentleman rejects your monastic calling because you are not Catholic. Please accept my apology, which I am sure is shared by the substantive community of regulars on this forum.\n\nI think you are new here?

His sacrifice covers our sin, allowing God to see us as perfect and unblemished.\nFor me this is the situation of the tax collector and Joe who are entangled in a sinful situation .\n\nMatthew Henry from the link\nhttp://biblehub.com/luke/18-10.htm\nThe Tax Collector \n“He owned himself a sinner by nature, by practice, guilty before God. He had no dependence but upon the mercy of God; upon that alone he relied. And God's glory is to resist the proud, and give grace to the humble. Justification is of God in Christ; therefore the self-condemned, and not the self-righteous, are justified before God”.\n\nThank you, Juergan for all your efforts.\n \nkevin your brother\nIn Christ",

McKenzie had the long td reception but did not look strong as a punt returner but that could change.  Can they keep both of them?  Butt can contribute after the bye week. He is the best TE on the team but can he overcome his injury history like Gronk did coming out of college? Bolles has looked outstanding in camp and against Chicago.  Carter has a lot of competition ahead of him but he has attitude, athleticism, and versatility going for him. Walker needs to slide back inside on passing downs.  Henderson reminds me of MJD.  He just seems like a tough dude.  All-in-all this looks like the best draft class for the Broncos in the Elway era.",

Also, the New York Times has said that Trump has grown more angry about the Trump-Russia investigation lately, blaming it on Comey.\n\nIn my opinion, the administration line that Trump was angry about Comey's interference to the detriment of Hillary Clinton during the election makes no sense whatsoever. At the time, Trump was yelling \"Lock her up!\" Comey did Trump a huge favor. That was then, this is now. The tables have turned, and Trump is feeling the heat. He needs to come clean, but that likely would be the end of his very short-lived political career. I don't think Trump can survive this even with the help of Mitch McConnell.

In comparison, it's a socialist, communist, monarchy, or totalitarian government that fixes social problems and prohibit free commerce.   So where commerce appears to solve a consumption need and the State regulates the commerce alleging public health, safety, or welfare needs, then the State must be fit enough for the job.  If not, the State will deny consumer capacity and starve necessary consumption, while excusing itself from its duty.  This may be acceptable in a communist regime, but not in Hawaii.",

There is no \"hard-line\" or mandate for land managers to restore all-native ecosystems and eliminate all introduced species.  The term invasive species was codified in 1999 through an Executive Order issued by then-Pres. Clinton, and clearly defined invasives as introduced species which cause or are likely to cause harm to the environment, the economy, or human health. The author fails to mention that invasive species are a very serious threat to our food security.  The vast majority of funds spent fighting IS, by state and federal agencies as well as by private landowners, is on agricultural pests.  (If you are tempted to believe that invasives aren't really that much of a problem, I encourage you to ask a rancher or farmer if they agree.) The author may \"like\" a species and disagree with the label - but that doesn't mean the species is any less of a threat to others who may suffer due to its presence, including endangered species.",

We can for example adopt the Obama health care plan, were people pay insurance companies for their coverage or they can pay higher taxes. You can't have health care without taxes and the cost to the economy is lower if health care is provided by the government. People know this but for some reason they can't accept that  there is there a need for taxes. Perhaps the problem is that the past 30 years have seen economic benefits go to the richest households but the tax burden has been shifted onto to lower income households.",

The concept was discussed in the first Bush White House. It was offered by Newt Gingrich as a free-trade alternative to \"Hillary Care\" during the attempt by the Clintons to set up a single-payer system. It was proposed again during the Dole Presidential Campaign of 1996. A similar system was implemented by Mitt Romney as Governor of Massachusetts. As a free-trade conservative myself, I wonder if had Mitt Romney (or John Mcain) had been elected in 2008, would he have proposed the ACA?  As Obama himself has predicted, will the Republicans tweak the ACA and rename it? DonaldCare anyone?",

Extra marital affairs was a sin. The only sexual act that was not a sin was sex between a man and a woman united in holy Matrimony. And even in that case, a child born was born with \"original\" sin. When the Hierarchy saw that many of its' priests were engaged in sexual activity with children how did they see it. Of course, they saw it as sin. Nothing has really changed in the Churches' teaching in the last one hundred years regarding sexuality.

Meanwhile some dude named Tauchman is pinch hitting late in games the Rockies are losing. Tauchman has never hit .300 in any season in his minor league career. He has a whopping 8 homeruns in over 1400 minor league at bats. Bridich and Black have some explaining to do. Meanwhile Part 2: The Rockies head out on the road where Black will continue to write the name Carlos Gonzalez into the starting lineup. Car-gone on the road this year in 185 at bats has a whopping 2 homeruns and 9 RBI. His slash line is .205/.264/.286. This makes Cargo the WORST player in MLB on the road who plays regularly.

He held a mirror up to us as a society, the better that we might see ourselves.  This is why his strip is still running.

In my opinion, this is the same modus operandi as climate alarmists', who identify singular weather events as the result of climate change (something we appear to agree on as being wrong and lacking the correct context). Yearning for science of yesteryear (\"In fact, climate scientists used to warn that specific weather events cannot reliably be attributed to a warming climate, even if there was a plausible link.\" - they still do: see the IPCC reports) seems deconstructive rather than inquiring, and I argue we need the reverse.

Sufferers of PUSSYS often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, the delusion that they are the majority, sudden & prolonged bouts of self-pity coupled with inexplicable feelings of euphoria, feeling sorry for themselves & uncontrollable whining. PUSSYS are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to see that Donald Trump is a pathological liar who was put in office by Putin, not the American people, & is an illegitimate president. In moments of lucidity, they experience intense fear that Trump will be impeached. Research is ongoing but PUSSYS appears to be prevalent in primarily conservative, profoundly ignorant, NRA Heavy, excessively religious red state populations.",

In comparison, we consume 100,000,000 barrels per DAY of oil. Vehicle air pollution causes 53,000 premature deaths each year just in the U.S. alone. The extraction, transportation, refining and ultimate burning of gasoline and diesel has a human and environmental cost that is orders of magnitude greater than from electric vehicle batteries. \n\nRather than blame EVs, it would be more productive to add Cobalt to the list of \"conflict\" minerals and strengthen existing international sanctions.",

The burden of costs will be shifted from wealthier Americans to poorer Americans, and from healthy and younger Americans to ill and elderly Americans. Some Americans, again especially poorer Americans, who have gotten health insurance for the very first time under the ACA's Medicaid expansion, will now lose it. And the future will be grim for those still on Medicaid as the proposed cuts will cause states to cut benefits, impose waiting lists, implement unaffordable financial obligations on beneficiaries, or otherwise restrict access to services.

The primary study that might support your suggestion was conducted at Purdue, and studied the possible exposure of bumblebees, not honeybees, to the dust from the planting of neoniconoid coated corn seeds.  This study has been criticized due to its small scale and the fact that the EPA has already determined that this poses only a minor risk to bees.  A study published in the Scientific Journal PLOS looked at neonics' affect on bumblebees in a three state study.  They concluded that it had no negative impact, and in fact appeared to increase foraging.  Science does not support you.",

A recent Toronto Star report indicated that two-thirds of GTA seniors are immigrants, which contrasts with a 2014 report indicating that immigrants now make up just over half the GTA's population. This suggests that Canada's urban immigrant population is quickly aging, likely because a significant percentage (about one-third, according to Stats Can) of relatively young skilled immigrants leave Canada after arriving here. The Star article also notes that GTA immigrant seniors, who often speak little English, report poorer health and mental health circumstances than do their Canadian-born counterparts. The implications are ominous for the viability of our health care system.\n\nhttps://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2017/05/16/significant-health-gaps-found-between-canadian-and-immigrant-seniors.html",

There are select winter studless tires made available in high speed ratings for pursuit vehicles, up to W rating (160+MPH) from Nokian, Firestone and a few others. Studs are used because they impart additional traction in specific challenging surfaces, such as black ice and snow powder over ice.

Why didn't the district plan on properly expanding the options program during the past decade when year after year the options programs were so preferred that families needed to win a lottery to get in?

The bankers who destroyed the economy, contrarily, were rewarded with huge bonuses and bigger profits than ever. Obama did their bidding beyond the call of duty. \n  Knowing Republicans and corporations would oppose change to health care, Obama could have begun single payer health care. Instead he made it easy for the next president to get rid of Obamacare. He forgot about the Bush-Cheney war criminals and their torture.
