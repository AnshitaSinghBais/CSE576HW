Welfare support payments are meant to be short term, ideally 3 months or less, and is never enough to cover basic living expenses for the long term.  The honest recipients are forced to spend all they receive.  Just as an example that benefit is spent on groceries, clothing and other basics.  Looking at  grocery expenses only, that helps support the grocer, his employees, his landlord and the food processors or growers++ all of whom pay taxes to the governments, and their own living expenses, (generating more tax revenue).

I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past. I'm an example of a successful survivor, but Brianna will never have that chance because someone brutally murdered her. Someone abused her - this time they killed her.  This young woman had her whole life ahead of her. She should still be alive.",

THEN reduce the amount of games to 70 since playoffs have several rounds.... then reduce to 60 games.\nEvery time the players negotiate a contract the amount of games increases. !?

Had those public employers paid the PERS pick-up each month along with the \"employer contribution\", there would be virtually NO unfunded mandate.  Folks shouldn't blame the public employees.  It was the legislature, school boards, city and county governments, et al who chose to NOT pay the contribution as it was \"credited\" to employee retirement accounts....

Still, to the chagrin of my peers, I never let them point toy guns (or even their fingers) at a human and say \"POW!\" No squirt gun fights, playing 'Army', 'Cops and Robbers', 'Cowboys and Indians' or Grand Theft Auto type video games (These came out later and as \"adults\" they played them anyway...). And I screened (to the best of my ability) their intake of movies and TV. Perhaps I was viewed as a hard ass, but, I know first hand that it sucks to be shot. Yet, guns have always been an important tool in my life and I'm not one to throw out a hammer over a black thumbnail. I've kept them handy and I've kept them loaded.

If Oahu can not care for the outer islands, it is long overdue for the outer islands to be granted the right, and share of state funds, to care for themselves.\n\nWe have seen this inequity played out time and time again. From our schools to our infrastructure needs. Our healthcare facilities lack, our environmental concerns are not protected, we are not protected from invasive species, but damn Oahu gets its rail.

This is what I find so riotously funny about the predicament of white Christians and all of their sympathizers. In Trump the finishing touches have been added to their two-bit, cartoon version of Christianity. Now every one can point and laugh heartily at the grotesque hypocrisy of this spectacle before it tumbles under the weight of its own crapulence.",

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, \"Economic Justice For All\", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: \"With Grave Concern\" (respectful thanks to Pius XI).",

It is very expensive to produce.  As you say, it depletes the soil and depends entirely on petrochemical fertilizers.  And it takes millions of acres of farmland out of food production and has a huge detrimental impact of the commodities market.  The use of more and more pesticides is just a little \"bonus.\"  We live in the country and a neighbor keeps 24 hives on our land.  He tells stories of beekeepers being completely wiped out as their hives were killed by such pesticides.  We're capable of being such damn fools.  Gary Crum",

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola.

Expectations should be known before going in, though - even better just don't get married, it's the worst possible contract for a male to have ever existed.",

If I remember rightly that was about 6-10 times what it should have cost. Sure my comment was tongue in cheek, but thanks for the link - I have been trying unsuccessfully to get an accurate price comparison, but no go.

There are challenges faced by both genders, and comparing and contrasting, to discover the \"winner\" of the airing of grievances, is a zero sum game.

The psychological ego was not well studied before the time of Freud.  If you are looking for authors of more recent repute you might look into the meaning described by Daniel Winnicott, and his descriptions of the childhood ego.  This man was both a pediatrician and a psychoanalyst.  Other good concepts about the Ego come from Melanie Klein, who started play therapy in child analysis.  One person that I have read extensively is Wilfred Bion's scholarly works about psychic structure.  All of these authors were alive and wrote in the past 100 years. Your religious use of the word ego implies self centeredness and as a psychic structure that would be false ego or egotistic...",

However, within the Mainline there are, in Lutheranism and Presbyterianism, confessional statements. Anglicans have scripture, tradition and reason, and the BCP. These adopt dogma long held within the church, and in the case of Luther a ringing defense of Real presence against Calvin and Zwingli who took a spiritual presence only view. Today, the evangelicals (an amorphous term) are closest to the sola scriptura model, and dismissive of fixed prayer and liturgy.",

In that case, residents will definitely notice a difference, a difference in their pocketbooks and in the quality of services provided by the city. They will also notice that the solution is not fair. \n\nProperty owners will bear the lion's share of the cost. And tourists and others on temporary stays will pay none.

On their website, Green Crow reports that they moved into Grays Harbor County, in 1986, to exploit the western red cedar resources for direct export to Japan. Green Crow's website notes that they have been at the forefront of corporate efforts to ship logs to Asian countries.

There you have the two forces that are the entire cause of the huge amount of economic dissatisfaction in America. It is not the Dems or the Independents. \nBTW if your fear is about open borders, I too am concerned about them but for a different reason, a Sociological reason. Unlimited immigration is damaging to the stability of any nation. I am not so concerned about them as you are -- for economic reasons.",

There is no conundrum here at all, the Church has always taught that marriage is indissoluble.

In the Legion we have lived an incredible adventure and have been saved by God's mercy: the Hound of Heaven. The NYT article brings out the basic decency of  Mr. Williams. Still I have always asked myself about the dominant right-leaning instinct of many of my colleagues, even when they are indeed decent. I am not at ease with that. Neither am I at ease with his association with Breitbart, and its anti-Islamic tint: with regard to Islam and other world religions, and with regard to ecumenism,  I follow Francis,  John Paul II and the Second Vatican Council.

Look up the research by Donald Tashkin on the prevalence of cancer and lung damage among  cannabis smokers. Spoiler alert: really heavy, long term cannabis smokers sometimes get bronchitis. An average country cannabis consumer has healthier lungs than an average city-dwelling non-smoker.\n\nMore significantly, cannabis is an economic substitute for alcohol and other drugs, such that when cannabis use goes up, drinking and other drug use goes down. Because alcohol is so exceptionally toxic, carcinogenic, impairing and criminogenic, even a slight reduction in drinking results in a net public health and safety benefit. For example, opiate overdose deaths have dropped about 25 per cent where cannabis has been legalized for medicinal purposes.",

Subsequent events have proven that would not have been wise, and as I now move towards retirement this spring I have a healthy dividend portfolio of mostly Canadian Dividend All-Stars paying me more than I'll require in annual income to fund that retirement.  No more watching the ups and downs of the market.  I'm following the annual dividend increases that I expect to take care of inflation in the coming years.

Balance that otherwise wouldn't have been there.  And that if it wasn't there, some pretty bad decisions and implications would exist.

Since then immigration has expanded dramatically and diversified greatly with nearly all immigrants coming from the third world. California has gone from an over 80% white state in the 1970s to 35% white by 2017. Hispanics now outnumber whites in California, New Mexico and among the young in Texas and Arizona.

They have a few decent right handed relievers, Brandon Morrow, ex-Blue Jay among them, but no Andrew Miller type setup guy either left or right. \n\nStill, I agree with you. If Darvish pitches well, it takes a lot of pressure off Kershaw, who is scheduled to be back, but you never know with back injuries. \n\nAlso, this .705 winning clip they are on, not sustainable and probably above where they should be.",

Put your partisan blinders up (and I'm sure this idea has flaws all its own), but I think it's a good starting point: Single-payer for all with something like a $50K deductible (no one knows what the real number should be, so for right now $50K is a placeholder). The government covers you for all expenses above $50K. Below that, you are on your own. Pay out of pocket or find an insurance to cover you below $50K.

The story relied on a single un-named source for some details, and as such did not meet CNN's standard. Given a choice of in which fact source I'd put my trust in, Trump versus CNN, it brings to mind that Mr Harper faux pas - it's a no brainer. \n\nIt's difficult to determine the facts when parties who may have broken the law work hard (and with the support of the leos) to obfuscate those facts.

Why would someone applaud platitudes mere days after Republicans actively reduced rules for keeping our water clean?\n\nThe tribute to the SEAL was emotional, of course, and I think it is fine to paint a rosy picture when the widow is in attendance. But afterwards, my thoughts returned to Trump saying \"they lost Ryan\" (they being the generals) rather than acknowledging he had a role. Even uglier are the memes now circulating attacking Sanders for \"refusing to stand\" even though he stood twice. Trumps goal may have been purely to honor the dead, but others are willing to lie about this just to score points.",

When I hike or go on the trails with my dogs, I watch for approaching hikers and command my dogs to walk next to me while passing hikers.  I don't allow them to approach strangers.  Not everyone loves dogs.  Not everyone likes when dogs run up to them even if they appear friendly.  Here in the neighborhood I live...I can not walk the neighborhood because too many dog owners allow their dogs out unsupervised.  If you can not seriously control your dog by voice then keep them leased or move to a rural area where you just won't run into people.",

If no candidate gets 270 votes (e.g. if it is close and Johnson picks up a State or two), then the House gets to pick between the top 3 candidates.

If a project is NOT a good investment, and does not attract private capital to build and operate it, then it is still NOT a good project, with public $$.  One would think this would be obvious, but JT is JT.  One reality in public procurement is that contractors know that the public is the final payor, so delays and cost overruns are very common and very large (see defense spending!!).  Injecting a profit motive, therefore, CAN in principle force efficiency, as a build/operate firm has real incentives to control costs.  Against that there is the fact they expect to make a decent return, much more than the % cost of debt to the government.  But even if you like some private involvement, you don't need this bank - just let private capital build Edm/Cal if it pays, if not, too bad!  This is just a badly disguised subsidy scheme, to get $ into dumb showcase projects, or the friends of Junior.",

Too many insurance policies out there do not cover short term renting. Meaning there is no liability coverage in place when someone sues the homeowner. This gets passed on to the community and leads to problems. There needs to be regulation requiring at least $500,000 of liability coverage. Smart insurance companies are already on top of this, Proper Insurance for example offers 1 million in commercial general liability coverage, and is customized for the short term rental market.

If half of immigrants are homeowners, I'd like to know how many in that number are from the 2004 cohort. We know over 50% of them live in the GTA and Van. You can't buy any sort of property in these regions on $33,000/yr.\n\nPerhaps Doug is referring only to the 50% of more recent immigrant households that have one or two university-degreed breadwinners. That would mean less than 25% of recent immigrants. I wonder how many of these folks had money from outside Canada to help them purchase? And, what's happening with the other 75%?\n\nIn the 1960s, the % of home ownership among immigrants was higher than for non-immigrants. That % has declined steadily since, and increasingly, most immigrants require more years in Canada to reach ownership, if they attain it at all.\nhttp://geography.uwo.ca/faculty/mok/paper/immigrants.pdf",

The technology exists, and we really need to move forward away from landfills, transporting our `opala to someone else's district. Every moku should take care of its own trash in these recycling centers. There is a former quarry site alongside H-3 between Kailua and Kaneohe that is a virtual \"hole in the ground\". This would make an ideal demonstration recycling center. To me, this is really \"walking the talk\". Nobody should have to absorb someone else's solid waste.",

Those towers were, when built (1972), the highest in the Western Hemisphere.  I wonder if bird and bat kill statistics are available for these military towers.\n\nRecent studies have shown that bird kills are greatly reduced when blinking lights replace the steady lights commonly used in the past.  This finding is now being applied to wind turbines.

The collars that go with electronic fences normally are NOT anti-bark and for good reason -- you don't want the dog confused over whether he is getting shocked because he is close to the boundary or because he is barking. I know because I have both collars for my dogs and I need to choose which one they wear.\n\nYes indeed he was barking because he did not have his bark collar on. He had his electronic fence collar on. And if you shoot an animal running he will continue moving for a short period of time, hence why dog was half out of his yard.",

(But I'm guessing you already knew that!)\n\nFor instance, the AMS just did a survey of broadcast meteorologists, and asked that question. They're a good group of scientists to ask, because they are well-qualified to distinguish between climate change and mere weather, but most of them have no \"skin in the game\" to bias their opinions.\n\nThe AMS found that only 15% of those meteorologists now believe that more than 80% of the last fifty years' warming is due to human activity. Another 34% think 61-80% of the warming is due to human activity. That means 15+34=49% believe that more than 60% of the last fifty years' warming is due to human activity.\n\nSo, the \"average position\" is that a little over half of the warming was caused by man (mostly by CO2).\n\nThat's not enough to be worrisome. It suggests an ECS climate sensitivity of only 1.5 - 2.0 °C, and a TCR sensitivity of only about 1.0 °C.\n\nRefs: http://sealevel.info/glossary.html",

Portions of Waikiki and Ko Olina are good examples of resort zoning that allow individuals to partake in the visitor lodging industry.

Currently, Oahu needs an additional 25,000 homes within the next 5-10 years to shelter local residents. If we follow Mr. Palmer's advice and convert between 11,000 to 17,000  (3-5%) of our residential-zoned homes into visitor lodging businesses, we're going to have a lot more residents go homeless.

In 2015 the MNA for Arthabaska, Sylvie Roy quit the CAQ and became an independent. Her death prompted the by election. Did some of her loyalists refuse to go back to CAQ ?\nDecember 5 was not a happy day for François Legault. \nThe CAQ lost support in three of the four bye-elections and failed to take back St-Jérôme, a seat they had won in 2012. \nDespite the upticks for QS in Verdun and Marie-Victorin, QS declined outside of Montreal & suburbs, falling to 5th place in Arthabaska.",

Spend some time on your search engine of choice and you'll see what I mean.\nI own two AR type carbines and lots of thirty round magazines. Seldom do I ever fill them to max capacity but when I do, I do. The main reason is I don't want to bother with reloading so often. There are times when I just want to keep up a sustained rate of fire.

So the state makes the loan which creates an artificial high value for the boat and permit which creates a need for more state loans because of the elevated cost when compared to risk.  There becomes a increasing disconnect between risk, and return on investment  that the state creates and no one should wonder why a traditional lender is not interested in the risk.

Far be it from me to attempt to explain a Calling they or no one could ever have anticipated, but from their witness the conviction settled in me that something is radically wrong about Institutional Roman Catholicism that denies females equal vocational standing with males. Exclusionary male priesthood  is a human convention - not so much a divine - this cultic injustice is wrongheaded",

The headline to me feels like clickbait.\n\nTake a look around at how business works.  Who created planned obsolescence?  Men. Who created our mission is to increase shareholder value?  Men.\n\nIf we want business to not be a moral abyss then we need places like Shecosystem.  In the article the quote says \"Women deserve a workspace and culture that empowers and inspires them to be their best and sometimes its worth building our own table rather than fighting for a seat at a table where we didn't want to be in the first place\".\n\nFor me, personally, I feel at home here because its a values-based workplace.

But rather than my prattling on about physics, why don't you reply with a tenable explanation for why government agents would bomb building seven? You didn't like my proposal. I cannot think of a more believable one. Can you? I mean, seriously man, what is going through your head? What is your \"grown up\" explanation (laugh out loud) for why government would sneakily demolish building 7 with explosives?
