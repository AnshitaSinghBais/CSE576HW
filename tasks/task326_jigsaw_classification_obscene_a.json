And when you’re a star they let you do it.  You can do anything…  Grab them by the pussy.  You can do anything.”\n\n— The President of the United States of America",

If they have a problem with that, they can turn over the Glenn and Seward highways to the Muni and we will put a damn toll booth at either end of the Muni to fund patrols and maintenance.

And given Trump's performance and behavior to date, I think there is a lot to question and criticize. Maybe, just maybe, the problem is with Trump, not so much with his critics. \nCriticism, just to get your name in the news, or to only score partisan political points undermines democracy. But I expect and want thoughtful, well reasoned criticism from our other officials when they think the country is going down the wrong path.

Trump is different, not only because of his sickeningly obvious unfitness, but even more because the Republican party has decided to give his corruption and lies cover in order to advance its own power.  Frankly, only a handful of Republicans with consciences can save the country.  But I wouldn't hold your breath.  Our own Lisa long ago learned that cynicism pays; and after all, she holds the safe Murkowski family senate seat, so why should she worry?

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola.

We clearly articulate preorders as \"strong leads\" in our offering circular. They are-- anyone who's put cash down, refundable or not, is a much stronger lead than someone who merely signs up for a test drive. Yes, we still have to build a compelling product, and continue to communicate that product to our pre-order customers. While some will certainly fall off, to me it seems likely they will more than be made up for from folks who are unwilling to place a preorder on something that is not yet in production, which is a very common refrain we hear.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the positive home-town encouragement.

Those holidays happen early enough in the school year that there is no way I wouldn't be able to make up the work, but since the teacher had scheduled a test for that day, with no way to make it up, I was out of luck as far as he was concerned.  Thankfully, my parents are both incredibly pushy and managed to make most of the problems go away without resorting to suing.\n\nAs for the Christmas songs, I would have been fine if they had been the secular Rudolph and Santa type songs, but not full on religious ones.",

Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.

He's completely regressed as he's aged, completely opposite of what's expected of a veteran. And I've said for a WHILE that he's literally THE LAST position player I want coming to the plate w/the game on the line. \nCLEARLY, Story took offense at my comment, and is trying to wrest that title from him. \nI wish there was a stat for the distance between the bat and the ball during clutch situation whiffs. I'm joking... kinda. But if they actually HAD such a stat, Cargo'd be among the league leaders. Be it sliders or curves off of the plate, or fastballs up around his shoulders, he misses by a LOT.\nHe's a great guy, he's awesome in the locker room/dugout, and having a bilingual veteran leader in today's MLB sure can't hurt.

Had he known of this event and \"covered it up\", and that \"cover-up\" been exposed, he'd be receiving considerable criticism.

Likewise, women in professions don't, on average, put in the same time as men. They care more about their families (for which, kudos to them) than climbing the greasy corporate ladder.

If Swift was in an upsetting assault situation why the hell is she smiling in the photo that is supposed to be damning. this case reeks of a spoiled damned celebrity whose Mom snottily insisted this DJ be fired.

The administration exercised that legal right and terminated Mr. Walls with no stated \"cause\".....that was perfectly legal...however \"unfair\" it might seem.  On the other hand, perhaps they did have \"cause\" but chose to \"take the easy way out\" and not go through the hassle of proving any justification for his termination.  They experienced considerable \"blowback\" because of their actions and, it seems, decided to \"buy off\" Mr. Walls for $90K....\"here that this damn money and go away!\"  The whole fiasco reflects very badly on the administration...these guys make too much money to be so horribly incompetent...Gary Crum",

And we already have it as far as how God made us and how He wants us to live from Scripture and His revealed teachings. The neo-Nazi, KKK et. al are not following God's Wisdom and neither are Antifa, BLM, LGBTQ groups, etc. They are all out for themselves and their \"rights\" instead of giving a fig for God's Rights and the rights of our fellow man.

So there is a potential non-military option available. But will the West sanction the validation of yet another despotic regime?

Calling such knowing misrepresentations \"lies\" is far more accurate than calling them \"mistakes\", while KellyAnn Conway's calling them \"alternative truths\" is simply silly.

My point is that individual liberty allows for context, differences of opinion, and deliberation. I'm not opposed to local communities or elected officials making a decision to move these monuments. What I do reject is the notion that our leaders should make these decisions based on trying to satiate a majoritarian mob. Conservatives (classical Liberals) are absolutely for freedom, liberty and justice for all peoples; but that is not achieved through lawless behavior. \n\nOur ultimate goal of freedom, liberty and justice for all is best achieved through economic freedom and human flourishing.

Lysenko taught a variant of Lamarckism, the idea that acquired characteristics could be inherited. Stalin like this, because it meant that Stalin's desire to \"create the new Soviet man\" would be instilled ed genetically from generation to generation. Of course, it failed.

People may tend to abandon their dog rather than pay the fine if not covered by the annual fee, but their next dog will have to have an RFID when they obtain it, and abandonment of an RFID'd dog will not get you out of the fine, so most people will eventually wise up and pay the annual fee.

After all, vaccines are products, not suitable for everyone, and like any other drug,  someone will have a life threatening reaction to it.  The choice to take this product must be left to the people.  And those who are injured need to be taken care of by vaccine manufacturers and the government - that's currently not the case in Canada.

There certainly wasn't any Liturgical 'watch-dog' group over-seeing developments in the liturgy.  This was done, not only in Greek, but in other languages in which the Liturgy was celebrated.  At this time, there was no Eastern and Western Churches.  For example, in the Chaldean and  Assyrian Rites, there are no words of Institution of the Eucharist, no consecration.  This went on for centuries [yes, they were and are faithful Catholics].  It was acknowledged with an agreement only on October 26, 2001.  There were other places during the Liturgies, where there is reference to the words of Jesus.\n\nWhen the Benedictine Order was established, the monks undertook the task of printing by hand---Sacred Scripture and the Liturgy.  But there were mistakes as well in the hand printing.  When humans do anything, there are errors.",

For example, in the School/College of Education decision reversal, even the Chancellor and Provost at UAF did not know that the decision had been reversed. To date, SP has not provided data to demonstrate the utility of decisions in cutting costs or improving education. Little to no impact analysis has been done. I'm not saying that Abel's plan is perfect, but it does at least attempt to project cost savings and possibilities for generating new sources of revenue.

With the Cruze plant located in the USA 100,000 new Cruze cars  will sell at a higher price.  To keep them competitive, Trump will  introduce his 30% China tariff, and other tariffs, and the net effect is some jobs saved, against higher prices for many goods.  Having to spend more for less goods is going to reduce overall demand, affecting demand in the US and around the world.  Globalization is not easy to unravel.\nIn summary, you're saving comparatively few jobs and increasing price pressure tremendously.",

If you look at anti-semitism, Europe has had it for two thousand years, culminating in you-know-what in the 1940s. Whereas the Jews were far better treated in the Middle East or India.",

Our government could best use their resources to combat Islamism (per example) rather than a mis-guided and wrong headed effort to combat Islamophobia by bill M-103. The sharia law of the Islamists provides for harsh penalties for criticism of the koran, Islam or Mohammed and it seems to me bill M-103 borrows from the ideology of the Islamists as it attempts to enshrine in Canada protection against criticism of Islam when in some instances, criticism should be made rather than  covered up.",

But as Funk, rossan, Borg, etc., progressed, the made theological moves: anything meaningful has to be historically verified. That was I think a historicist, rationalist approach, sharing in the rationalism of Ehrman, Mack, et al. Luke Timothy Johnson's critique was on the mark: a private endeavor of Funk.  Except his \"solution\" was :the metaphysical Jesus, which undercut all historical study. But I have read broadly across boundaries among exegetes--mainly in English. Still, I favor John Meier and James Dunn, principally because of their careful historical approach, employed without trying to fit everything into a \"historicist\" straightjacket. The Jesus Seminar, what is left of it, has simply become unitarian universalist, claiming a historical pedigree while doing embracing a preferred theological agenda.",

I don't think it was ever written into law - it was a ministerial order to his underlings, caused by a particular event.\nThe school was forced to abandon the rules, and thus the kids abandoned the lawsuit.\n\nHe was right to. The right of schools to make rules does not supercede the constitutional rights of students. As was recently confirmed in the OGOD case yet again.\n\nYou spoke of limits to rights. Do you understand that the rights of school boards to make rules are ALSO limited rights ?

Let's suppose the coach most responsible for the excruciating defeat in Kansas City returns home and finds his dog jumping around in glee at the occasion of his arrival. The coach, in his melancholy state of mind, thinks, \"He's mocking me. My dog is mocking me!\" Whereupon, he kicks the poor thing to death. We don't want that now, do we!?! Let's stay the course on this one and provide a humane execution that will send a subtle but indelible message to the coach that we expect a more lively presentation of our local football team in the future.

No.  That's an American territory.  Will it be against South Korea?  No, the U.S. will counterattack and besides, the North wants to own the South in good condition.  Will it be against Japan?  No, again because of the U.S.  But, wait!  There are those 2 Russian occupied islands in the north of Japan.

As for the unbearably sad story of Charlie Gard, who had an extremely rare inherited genetic disease - encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) - it was not an insurance company case worker who determined he was out of options. It was instead his own doctors and even Columbia University's Professor Michio Hirano, who initially proposed the unproven nucleoside therapy, who determined from a purely-scientific standpoint that nothing more could be done for him. The story of Charlie Gard is an incredibly heart-wrenching story, but it's a story about a tragedy, not how we pay for healthcare.

Also, I didn't note that the thinkers in question claimed unique possession of any goods- proper, as Mattson says. Rather, it seemed they claimed a happy sort of relation to some of those goods.

No.  The developer would rather get it built and sell the units at their market value once complete.  Because banks add this requirement, the developers have no choice but to look at it as a cost of financing.  \n\nAs to the suggestion that someone is avoiding property transfer tax by re-selling their right to buy, their is no merit to that.  No real estate has changed hands.  The only thing the pre-sale buyer sells is the right to buy, not the actual real estate.  \n\nAs to whether the ultimate sale attracts the 15% foreign buyer tax, that is a function of the residency of the ultimate buyer once the building is complete.",

Behind the question of \"worthiness\" of the celebrant of the Sacraments was an ecclesiology that believed that the Church was a \"society of saints\" more than a \"school for sinners.\"  \n\nThis was a tension in the Church at that time.  Roman persecutions having ended, there were those, like the Egyptian hermits, who believed that the Church had gone \"soft.\"  Only the hard-core believer, willing to offer his/her very life for the Lord was worthy of discipleship.    They lamented how \"secular\" Christian had become (Sound familiar?)  \n\nThe rigorists (i.e., Donatists) were often allied with the Arians, presenting Christ as the \"super-human\" who, by sheer effort and heroic self-denial, served as a witness for all Christians.  For that reason, Athanasius was happy to use St. Antony of the Desert, hero of the Egyptian monastics, as an ally against the Arians.",

Almond smelling cyanide was one of the often used murder weapons of the southern European mafia. There has been much written about JP I's death that indeed substantiate that this was a very suspicious death.  Just a blood test would have discovered poisoning.  Even today if his bones were exhumed there is a good chance a poison like cyanide could (or would according to many investigators) discover these types of poison.

Specifically, when the babies brain starts recording experiences and motor function is more than reflex action. At this stage, the fetus is not a cluster of cells anymore. This is the standard we use to determine death, it works just as well to determine life imo.\n\nI am ok with my taxes funding abortions in instances of rape or incest. (Even other situations where the mother had very little choice in conception) I think the mother's healthcare should help cover instances where her health is at risk due to pregnancy.

We have a choice to make between two very unpopular candidates, one has a world of experience in government, both nationally and internationally, and the other has absolutely no experience in governing anything, and has proven time and time again that he is nothing more than a mentally unstable, lying narcissistic egomaniac without any connection whatsoever to reality. As someone that has voted for candidates on both sides of the political spectrum over the years I've done a lot of fact checking since this presidential campaign began, and I have based my opinions on facts, as opposed to political rhetoric. For that reason I will vote for Hillary Clinton.",

It can take years for an assault charge to be investigated and prosecuted criminally.   Where the evidence is sufficient, the university has a duty to other students to ensure their safety by dealing with the alleged assailant, to the point of expulsion if necessary.    While providing due process, of course, which doesn't mean accepting all allegations credulously.",
