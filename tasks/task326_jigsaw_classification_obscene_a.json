Citizens subsidize Developers like Zepplin and then they complain when there is no parks and trails by them and say we will do it ourselves. Well that's what happens when you make a killing as a developer in RINO and pay nothing to the city for impact fees or Cash-in-lieu.

I've had a look at your account, and to be quite honest I'm not sure of the reason for your restriction! I do know however, that your restriction doesn't have to do with other users choosing to flag your comments--even if a large number of your comments are flagged (for good reason or not), it is still up to a moderator in the end to decide what to do with them. In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you. However, the restriction should be lifted tomorrow, Jan. 14th!\nThanks,\nEmily",

The newspaper of record at the time wrote this as part of the reasoning for this decision:\n\nWhile adding $200 million to the $3.9 billion construction, the airport route would average an estimated 95,000 passengers a day, while the Salt Lake route would carry 88,000. The airport route would be useful to employees commuting to the airport and Pearl Harbor Naval Base\n\n“;The higher cost of the airport alternative would be offset by the higher ridership and user benefits for that alternative,”; the environmental statement says. \n\nSo my question, even if you adjust the numbers because your cutting out half the line, wouldn't the system still be viable for the time being at least from those employees that work at the airport and JBPHH?",

Do you think you might need to replace a few things -- couple pieces of furniture, maybe a kitchen remodel or two? Maybe you might renovate or even move? Not to mention, schools should be preparing students for working in this century, not the past. Take a look at your phone -- do you still use a rotary phone or party line?  Still use that formal living room as much as you did when you bought that house? FWPS is trying to give our students the opportunity to learn next-generation skills, and they can't do it in an old 1950's formal living room. Heavy-duty wear-n-tear means heavy-duty solutions.",

Some can cause severe reactions if inhaled. Smoke inhalation could also be a cause of the symtoms. I understand the residue of conventional explosives is also toxic if inhaled in closed spaces. Also there is the possibility that the rebels had chemical weapons that were release during Syrian attacks. ISIS is reported to have used them.\n\nWe may never know for sure what happened but I think it is unrealistic to jump to the conclusion that Assad's regime is responsible.

Any funds the parents raised privately for transfer to the US were not available for three months after that.\nMany top doctors, from other hospitals and countries, consulted on this case, the parents appointed their own independent consultant, they all concurred that the treatment would not benefit the child.\nThe parents did not give 'informed consent' to using Charlie for experimental purposes.  They insisted to the end that this was a treatment that would make Charlie a 'normal little boy'\nCharlie was given the best available, without concern for costs.

Even Yuma County with a whopping 10K people has a taxable O&G value of $240M, which would equate to $23K/person of taxable value.  Denver is zero.  Personal property is often used as an indicator for sales tax revenue.  Denver is $23,100/person, Yuma is $23,600, Weld is $34,900.  So from a personal property standpoint Denver citizens are poorer than even Yuma citizens. \nYou should challenge your urban-centric paradigm a little bit more by really visiting other parts of Colorado (not just driving through).

I'm talking about the church getting involved in things like programs that give kids positive role models where they have none and teach them to live by the principles of God instead of the street. That's where preaching utterly fails but relationships and going into the community to do more than pass-out literature succeed.  We need to stop measuring the \"success\" of our churches by how many people are baptized, but by answering questions like: If my church disappeared today, would the community miss it?

Of course, there are other reasons, everyone is different, but surely to say so does not constitute Revisionism. Naturally, Father Reese does not blame the banishment of the Latin Mass (though interestingly he does acknowledge that is the case for 11 % - a good argument against his advocacy of renewed banishment at least).

But honestly, more absurd than the misinterpretation of those words is the assertion than any kind of animal-sourced dairy is \"healthy\" (as though for some reason ice cream is unhealthy, but bleu cheese is great for the body!). Cow milk is meant for one thing and one thing only, to fuel a baby calf and help it grow into a 2000 lb cow/bull.

Both are no longer supported by their respective open-source communities and have numerous bugs that have been fixed in subsequent releases.

The need in Eugene for subsidized housing is much greater than the supply. \n\nEveryone's situation is different. The amount of food stamps you get is based on your income and other considerations such as how many people you're supporting. \n\nNationally, food stamp amounts are inadequate. especially for people with kids, and do not last the month. The states run the program, and a lot of them are very restrictive. A whole lot of people in this country are struggling just to survive.

I may not claim any death threats, then or later, no self-imposed exile, but 7000 of us students took the protests seriously, some were arrested, most of us eventually returned to our books.\n\nToday, if there were a protest to restore the academic qualities of the UCT I remember I would join it, not for he sake of nostalgia or colonialism, but to give the youth of South Africa the benefits, that you may like to call privileges, thatt apartheid granted me.\n\nYour attitude is insulting.

Vehicle wind resistance for the majority of cars increases the faster you go, decreasing mpg. \n\nThe increase is actually exponential, meaning wind resistance rises much more steeply between 70 and 80 mph than it does between 50 and 60. \"\n\nThis site lets you compute how much your mpg will drop by going faster. For my 30 mpg car, driving 80 mph reduces mpg by 28%. Meaning I'm buying more gas to go the same distance at 80 mph versus 65 mph.

And above all, my father was an independent thinker  who would not compromise on the freedom of thinking independently.  It didn't take me much to stop trusting religious leaders who want to rule on the members' thinking process. When I saw the Church's misleading in the Desmond Ford csse in the 1980s, it was the last straw!\n\nLooking back into the SDA educational system, I can see exactly why Dr. Taylor is right!

And the fact is, too many parents lack the skills to be good parents and do not or have not learned from their own parents how important it is to show one's love to one's children. Many children who lack this turn to bad behavior such as bullying and grow up with problems that lead to incarceration. We need to begin in the schools and Mr. Rod is showing why we need to start there. If the parents do not give their children this love, where else can they receive the love and discipline?

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

A tax system that can confiscate private property or put someone in jail is not compatible in a free society based on individual liberty & private property rights. In part it is a redistribution of wealth from people who have earned it to people who have not earned it. An income tax means the government decides how much of the fruits of my labor I am allowed to keep. The weaker private property rights are, the less freedom we have. People who have no property rights at all have no freedom at all. The income tax was the 2nd tenant of Marx & Engels “Communist Manifesto”. Our Founders supported consumption taxes in the form of tariffs & excise taxes. A sales tax is a consumption tax. After the budget was cut further, I would support a flat sales tax. https://nccs.net/1996-03-answers-to-americas-tax-problems",

He said so himself. \nAnd the tax dollars he spent all that time asking about?? Perhaps another $200-300 per year per home owner for a $450 million dollar bond. People throw away that much in leftovers in a year.\nCelski asked questions to indicate his true feelings then pandered to the audience for votes. \nDon’t be fooled.",

It says that he was staying in the Anchorage hostel as a monthly resident when this story makes it clear he was paying $30 a night.\n\nIt says \"agents,\" implying agents of the FBI, gave him his gun back, when that obviously wasn't the case.\n\nTwo of the more scary parts of this is that he was identified as being nuts in Puerto Rico, years ago, and his gun was taken away by police, only to have it given back there, as happened in Anchorage. Also, thanks to the NRA, its is quite difficult for the police to take guns away from psychotic people in many jurisdictions, especially Alaska.

I do not know any Republicans, including myself that are pleased with Senator Murkowski's voting record from the very beginning.  Her voting record proves she is fiscally irresponsible.  There has been no spending bill that she did not vote for from the bail out of Wall Street, the Stimulus Bill, Omnibus Bill, and on the last budget vote she gave the POTUS everything he wanted.  She has been more than willing to kick the can down the road even though our National Debt is over $19 Trillion.  On social issues she is quite liberal, and she promotes amnesty under the code name of 'legal status' for illegal  immigrants.  Murkowski could be the poster child for RINO.",

Next question is how can a fire spread so fast and intensely in a building made of concrete?  The other point is instead of installing fire sprinklers in each condo which in 2017 prices, could approach $12,000 for each condo owner, how about a partial sprinkler system in which there is a sprinkler system ONLY in the common walkways of these type of older condos & the sprinkler systems do not extend into each individual condo.  Marco Polo, like Waipuna, are open air type common walkways on each floor & it should not be that difficult nor expensive to run water pipes up the side of one building and then run the sprinkler pipes only in these common area walkways.  Had this type of partial sprinkler system been installed, the common walkways areas would have remained clear of smoke, fire and destroyed only the condo in which the fire originated and not nearby condos on the same or upper floors....",

With governments, the people directly elect key people in the government, but have little direct influence over the type of government, which for the most part is established in the constitution and is only changed slowly over time through reforms.\n\nIn my opinion, the management styles for thes two types of organziations are very incongruent.",

But to say that EPD is intimidating, harassing, and preying upon the community because they are handing out candy?? Those are some pretty serious accusations.

To me, it seems better to find a way to wind down the DREAM program. Those with no current education commitments, have 1 year to either attain citizenship or leave. Those currently in college, have what is left of their 4-year degree program (max) to finish their education and attain citizenship, or leave at the end. They are not without a country, they have a citizenship - albeit one somewhat unfamiliar to them.

I also agree that the overwhelming majority of people in this country are good, decent, hardworking people who are not themselves bigoted. The problem, however, is not individual racism but institutional racism. When the levers of power are predominantly accessible to select classes of Americans -- and denied to others -- discriminatory practices are built into the very structure of that society. What we saw in the election of Donald Trump was a panicked grab for those levers by a class of Americans who not only feels their grip slipping, but also spies those \"other\" classes coming up fast. This is what the \"Again\" in MAGA is all about. The vehemence with which some commenters on this thread deny that fact is proof of the primacy of institutional norms to guide individual behavior, even for otherwise good, decent, hardworking people.",

If you find misrepresentations of fact in those stories, (most of which, BTW, come from \"wire services\"), by all means note them and demand a correction. \n\n President Trump is, IMO, a seriously mentally ill person and his every action as President replects that illness.

If the words were said, which they were, and in such a case as this, the logical conclusion is that he as a judge is incapable of impartial treatment to either sides regarding testimony.  The only thing that can be done is to ascertain what punishments have been given to other judges who have behaved in this manner and use those examples when sentencing him.  \nWhen someone has such clear biases that are inherently part of them,  they tend to show up sooner or later.  That he would dare utter them openly  in a court of law means that what he is saying is already an integral part of his belief system,  and in this case  I highly doubt he has suddenly seen the error of his ways;  I would question his reformation.  The problem is that most judges get a slap on the wrist but there are some bad apples in every bunch and this one is rotten.",

Hillel noted the text said a man could divorce his wife for \"a cause of sexual immorality.\" Since rabbis believed that every word in Scripture was there for a reason, Hillel decided that this word \"cause\" must refer to other grounds for divorce besides sexual immorality. Hillel believed a man could leave his wife for any reason: wearing her hair unbound or burning the toast.\n\nShammai, on the other hand, thought that Deuteronmy 24 only referred to sexual immorality, and that this \"any cause\" divorce was wrong.\n\nHillel's \"any cause\" divorce was popular among Jewish men. It was much easier to get, though more expensive. It is almost certainly what Joseph was thinking of when he considered divorcing Mary \"quietly\" in Matthew 1:19.",

Since then, many reports says that the level of  methane emissions in Canada has been underestimated. But even at 15%, the level of methane emissions in Canada is very worrying. Methane emissions have an enhanced effect on climate change because methane has a \"climate forcing effect\" 25 times grater on a 100 year basis than CO2 (72 times grater on a 20 year basis).\nMethane emissions from the oil and gas industries are the largest anthropogenic sources of Canadian CH4 emissions, according to Canada's latest submission to the UNFCCC in April 2016. \nProduction of crude oil in the Alberta bitumen oil sands is a major source of CH4 emissions as more and more natural gas is used to extract and process bitumen. It is estimated that around 20% of all the natural gas extracted in Canada goes to process bitumen. Most of this gas is \"fracked gas\" which is in itself a large source of CH4 emissions.",

And that was a fraction of the bomba tzar that was rigged at 50 mega tonnes ( it actually did lower temp slightly for that area for a couple of years ).\n\nOtoh, age really has potential to turn Denver into looking like northern Mexico.

OF course the sleazy green money grubbers don't want you to know this because the need to scare you into sending them money to pretend to solve the (non-)problem.\n\nFurthermore, growth is highly subsidized by taxpayers, and yet it never pays for itself. See: http://www.fodorandassociates.com/rpts_and_pubs.htm\nME Somehow we grew for 150 years without bankruptcy. So this is more bull crap from the anti-growth zealots. Next you'll try to convence us that we should get out of $0.25/passenger-mile cars for $1.00 per mile buses or $1.60 per passenger-mile toy trains. http://www.debunkingportland.com/top10bus.html",

Their schools peppered the east coast cities of New York, Philadelphia, Newark, Atlanta, Boston, and more, as well as the Midwest -- Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus. The Sisters also established Xavier University in New Orleans, a very prominent institution of the city, which is still in existence.

Canadian oil producers have the capacity to export to other countries using U.S. port facilities, and they did it in 2014 (The Globe and Mail, Nov. 02, 2014 :\" Oil sands crude reaching Europe, Asia\"). Around 1.2 million barrels in \"total\" were shipped to refineries in Europe and Asia in July and August 2014. That same year,  Canadian crude oil exports to the U.S. averaged 3.5 million barrels \"per day\".  With the price differential between Brent and the TWI  at its highest, 2014 should have been the best opportunity for Canadian crude oil producers to make it on the international market. It didn't happen. That is why when the CAPP and the politicians argue that we need more pipeline to reach tidewater to reach foreign markets, they are lying. Crude oil carried by the Kinder Morgan expansion will end up as before at U.S. West Coast refineries.",

A SINGLE SEAT and LOW COST solution.\n.\nVirtual track rail (meaning no tracks required) is going in all over China and the companies providing it have factories already in the US and the systems are FTA approved.

They maybe right. Sad. Very, very,  sad.",

And it is a question of whether the people in this neighborhood are being asked to bear more than is fair in the way of having to change their lives and adapt to greater population density.

Even then the 1000 HP figure is only instantaneous during maximum acceleration - a feature intrinsic of electric traction ( DC ) motors. The issue as always with electric vehicles is battery capacity and life expectancy - but methinks a toned down version ( e.g. like the Chevy Volt ) will be the long term practical solution. \n\nMost of current IC vehicles are grossly over powered in order to obtain acceptable acceleration - not to maintain the usual cruising speeds. Smaller high efficiency IC engines ( constant speed ) and batteries for acceleration are in my mind the future - not the pure battery powered heavily subsidized greenie day dreams  that get sucked in and stuck in the air cleaner of my 1/2 Ton .......    .-)",

It's in the EIS, kill off like 15 of the bus routes that parallel the rail.\n\nI am not sure i would agree with other stuff you said. some of it maybe.  A lot of the homeless that use the bus now have disability bus passes. So it's almost like it is free. Like $30 a year.

Hopefully, AOGCC oversight will manage situations so that abandoned wells are properly handled, but some of the Hilcorp related stories at that Lousiana news source seem to show that putting off abandonment activities could be a problem.  http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2017/03/oil_gas_leaking_from_abandoned.html\n\nThen, that story links to a barging/ drilling transportation incident and oyster farmer lawsuit. http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2016/07/oyster_growers_sue_hilcorp_for.html\nThe suit says Hilcorp did not have required Corps permits when they attempted to move a drilling barge with 8' draft into 6' deep waters. \nMany links you can follow..",

The owner had no sign that said \"electric fence underground\" so this man had no idea if the dog would stop. The dogs body was past the electric fence by the time he stopped shooting. \nThis man was odiously fearful. \nHave any of you been in the situation of self defense? How are you to say what he should and shouldn't do? He could've shot once, I don't know his caliber of gun, but he did shoot way too much. who's to say what a humans reaction should and shouldn't be at that moment of fearing death or serious injury. \nI do understand it hurts to lose a dog, especially like this.",

It looks to me like Trump shares all of these problems.\n\nOn the other hand, for all of those faults, he did manage to do some things that were actually of benefit to the nation as a whole. I believe that, while he and I are political opposites, he did actually want to improve the nation. I also, by the way, think the same of Reagan and both Bushes.\n\nHistory may prove me wrong on this point (and I honestly hope it does), but I have seen no real indication from Trump that he is interested in well-being of the nation, or that he has the ability to forward such an interest if he does have it.

It was not there in 2010. Usually this is the result of pesticides...and can cause illness and death in infants if in higher concentrations than the 'average' ppm quantity found  in their 2016 samples; however this amount can spike quickly in well water near the nitrate sources.  More research on this is needed probably 'just because' ...   Sources of nitrate in our water can exist other than pesticides; but they aren't good for us either - sewage related things.

Go with the new funding total of $8+ billion to complete a 32-mile locally preferred alternative with 31 stations and 35 four-car trains.\nOtherwise, stay with steel wheels and expect to see the mayor back again next year stating that the new funding plan is not enough to reach Ala Moana.",

I don't know what happened with that ban, whether it went into effect or not. To my knowledge hunting ammunition isn't under consideration for a ban, though I think most high-powered hunting bullets would penetrate Kevlar armor.\n\nGame hunting has many advocates among sports retailers, guides, the tourist industry, and wildlife management agencies. Big game bullets are carefully engineered and manufactured to kill quickly, and those characteristics make them able to penetrate heavy bone while deforming in a controlled manner. The point is, that design is crucial to relatively humane hunting.",

It seems to me that we are close to \"peak air traffic.\" As with so many other things, it means getting air traffic infrastructure to new places, whether it can be done under the terms of conventional safety or not. So it is very good that orbital systems can situate the locating functions so well.\n\nI'm enjoying Guy Murchie's book, \"Song of the Sky\" again after several decades. He wrote it in the early 1950s as an air navigator and it's an absolutely superb telling of the needs of locating oneself and the part of the planet that is between sea level and the stratosphere. It makes me want to go out and buy a sextant, and learn how to use it!",

(2) it disenfranchises minority opinion in a state, either red or blue, (3) it allows for an outcome where the popular vote and the EC vote don't coincide - which is a terrible situation for a democracy.  Like most people I thought Clinton would win the popular vote.  Unlike most people, however, I thought it was possible, because of Clinton's unpopularity, that there would be many more 3rd party voters, and that it was possible that Clinton would win the EC and Trump would win a plurality of the popular vote, and given the rhetoric from the Trump campaign about rigged elections, there might even be bloodshed.",
