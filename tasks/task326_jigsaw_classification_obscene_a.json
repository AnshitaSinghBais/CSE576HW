That starts right at the top of the pile & trickles all the way down to the local level. Case in hand would be the crooked officials that collect per diem when they live in Juneau or when they state that they're in session but are not at all. Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks. Why can't you just get off your fat lazy butt & take the time to deliver it to the office rather then use an unnecessary service. Waste!",

Suddenly he had a roster full of superstars and not enough money to pay them all with the new cap.

Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.

They found a way to use a \"reduction in force\" to end my employment.  Like Mr. Johnson,  I felt I had been \"royally screwed\" and was extremely bitter.  Fortunately, I was able to \"get over it\" and keep that bitterness from clouding my future.  It wasn't real easy,   I still think the administrators and Board members were a bunch of #@$%$s, but they are $#$%^s \"in the past.\"  I've \"gotten even\" by enjoying the last 30 plus years and, while I've been \"at it\", outliving all of them.\n\n  It sounds like Aaron is doing the same.  \n\nThis will sound a little \"preachy\", but, IMO,  how we handle \"getting screwed\" is more important than \"getting screwed\"  regards and best wishes,   Gary",

After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past.

Isn't that just a different form of forcing an external viewpoint on her?\n\nAs for \"numbers\" whatever you meant was somewhat unclear. The wearing of a veil is still rare in Canada and terms like \"mass immigration\" are meaningless. What quantity is \"mass\"? What reduction in the current immigration levels would mena that it is no longer \"mass\".

It's Donald Trump and a violent minority that are attempting to re-write history--white-washing Nazism, playing the victim while at the same time they attack and kill Americans. Turns out the supporters of Donald Trump are the terrorists and Donald is their defender. Donald thinks he can \"grab America by the pussy\" because he's a billionaire but he's just a racist scumbag and a fascist.

Perhaps they want us to support Isis and the'moderate' terrorists so that Assad can be overthrown and Israel can encroach upon even more territory?  Or maybe they think we should keep violating Syria's political integrity so that the southern pipeline can go ahead unimpeded.  But let's be clear about a few things:  The US is *not* the 'world's sole superpower'--it never has been.  And in any conventional military confrontation with either Russia or China, we would have our asses handed to us. The only way the US could 'win' in Syria is through the utilization of nuclear weapons.  But maybe that's what Rogan and his crowd want after all.

While in some countries a common slur might be \"hijo de puta\" or \"son of a whore\", in Peru it more commonly would be \"hijo de cura\" or \"son of a priest\", because that is the equivalent of \"bastard\" being that the biological father is forbidden from marrying his defacto common-law wife. But an honorable priest would be expected to adequately care for his \"wife\" and children, and this reality is tolerated because it is the people or community (sensus fiedelium) who not only support but at times require that a priest have an attachment.

I would suggest the natives start pulling their own damned boots on for a change, quit relying on the government and get resourceful. The reservations I have been around all offered a great deal of resources.  I'm not talking mining or drilling although those were generally present as well.  I would suggest hunting, fishing, hiking, tourism, even cultural history.  Nearly every reservation in the country is loaded with these resources and lets face it many of us would love to learn more about your culture and you.  Think about it!

Like management has the right to direct the workforce. Unions specifically don't have comanagement rights. Like how to clean toilets. What stands out in the article above is how the Hawaii public worker collective bargaining law rules out any negotiations on working conditions. A standard feature of pretty much all collective bargaining agreements. An example, AC in the schools. When you get to the heat levels in some of Hawaii classrooms it becomes a health and safety issue. Yet teachers could niether file a grievance, nor even negotiate it.

Or that many, many Republicans already are condemning Trump's words.\nI suppose you're fine with Trump sniggering on Howard Sterns's show as the great lecher described Trump's daughter as a hot \"piece of ass.\" What father wouldn't punch that guy in the face? Trump is a very sick man. At this juncture, to support him is the act of a morally confused person.",

The \"learning curve\" being one. As you are probably well aware from the reports of the various Judicial Reviews here in Ireland; the repeated phrase of many bishops & superiors; was that they had no awareness; it was all new to them; they had no training; they were never prepared for such scandal; nobody told them etc. These were the men with PhDs in various disciplines. The best and the brightest, that got the tap on the shoulder. They were the \"good shepherds\", who would look after \"their flocks\". Good shepherds would not leave their flocks vulnerable to predators.\n \"Lies; lies and damn lies\" . \nYour synopsis is very revealing and opens up another path to understanding this critical failure by the institutional church.

Their is a law on the books outlawing Muslims from even being in this country but no one pays any attention to that!  Democrats think a wall on our southern border is such a bad thing but they erected a wall around their convention hall.  I am telling you if we don't elect Donald Trump you can bend over and kiss your ass goodbye since you will not like what becomes of us.",

Trump is different, not only because of his sickeningly obvious unfitness, but even more because the Republican party has decided to give his corruption and lies cover in order to advance its own power.  Frankly, only a handful of Republicans with consciences can save the country.  But I wouldn't hold your breath.

Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him. If this were Lynch's first season with the team, I'd agree with your logic but I believe his leash will be shorter - especially since it is also tethering the new coaches and possibly higher.",

These are confirmed orders on which deposits have been paid by homeowners. I have a quote from one of these drillers for late April 2018. They are not available to drill for the COCT. There are fly by nights from other provinces but they do not understand local drilling conditions and are far less likely to succeed. This is crucial. There is also a high failure rate on new boreholes. \n\nIt is impossible for me to quantify precise savings. However my argument is that existing supplies are inadequate for existing population numbers and this is the imperative for halting population growth until supply matches demand",

The Church clerics have clung onto those privileges ever since and continually advanced their own cause of elitist, narcissistic clericalism.

Of course there is a lot of variation and other reasons why inflation might be lower or higher in any given month, hence why averaging out over a longer of period of time can help \"smooth things out\".\n\nSill it is not unreasonable to guess that Ontario's Cap 'n Trade added maybe 0.6 percentage points to inflation, averaging inflation here vs. Manitoba and Quebec.  So if your family's after-tax income is $50,000/year the cap'n'trade tax might be costing you about $300/year?\n\nActually the cap'n'trade tax is expected to be a bit regressive, so with $50,000/year income it probably costs more than $300.",

The main danger to Bosnia and Herzegovina came from the self-styled war heroine of Tuzla Airport, Hillary Clinton, promoting a unitary state for BiH rather than a federation. Reasonable people can agree to disagree over how the federation should be structured; possibly giving a Croat entity the same status as Republika Srpska has some merit. However, but for now at least, not even a quarter of century after the Bosnian war, only a federation makes sense.

Improved library services and enhanced funding for colleges to maintain and grow its programming. Let's attract talent! This is what makes a place livable. And these expenses are just for the cities.

As recently as Arizona v. United States, the Supreme Court has stated that the Executive branch has prosecutorial discretion in deciding how to allocate resources when enforcing laws. As explained in a Slate article:\n“Congress sets only the outer limits of executive power, like a board of directors giving general marching orders to the CEO of a corporation. The president, like the CEO, makes most of the decisions as to policy as well as to enforcement. Congress can prevent the president from doing certain things by refusing to grant him authorization to do them. But Congress generally cannot force the president to enforce a statute if he does not want to.\"",

Further, even if changing behaviour is an appropriate use of the tax code, the statement that doctors practice medicine in the same fashion whether they are incorporated or not seems false. The limited liability offered through incorporating encourages doctors to invest more of their wealth into expensive diagnostic tools and other capital intensive equipment.

And, for the record, an otolaryngologist told me the best thing for parents to do for children with hearing loss was to read aloud to them regularly and a lot, sitting with the text visible to the child. \n\nSudden ear pressure change can burst the ear drums.\n\nResearch shows that children with early hearing loss are more likely to struggle in school (regardless of the use of hearing aids) and if the diagnosis is delayed or missed, they are more likely to be incarcerated as adults.

And the anchor islands (the Slate Islands, Pic and Michipicoten islands in Lake Superior) that were once inaccessible to wolves now have routine wolf visits with anthropogenic origins for their visits. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources trapped the wolves from Michipicoten Island, but not to relocate them, just to study them while they killed and ate most of the caribou. I'd call that mismanagement.",

The states with the strictest sex ed policies tend to have the highest rates of teen pregnancy.\n\nAlso, policies like refusing HIV/AIDS relief funding except for programs that offer abstinence-only education. The best way to have sex and prevent HIV/AIDS is to use proper contraception. It usually spreads in places that are either ignorant about sexual health or have no access to contraception.

Ever-increasing building in flood-prone areas is another.  \n\nProbably the biggest is more effective drainage ditches.  Everyone wants to get the water off his land fast in the spring so he can get on with planting.   Nothing sinister about that, except that the water has to go somewhere.  The guy downstream gets it faster than he used to, so there is more flooding.  Digging more effective drainages started in the 1930s and accelerated after the war.  It is no coincidence that, in addition to the major flood in 1950, there were significant floods in 1948, 1956 and 1965.

It costs less to send a parcel from China to Toronto than it does to send it from Vancouver to Toronto and Canada Post does 90% of the work involved. But now they have a space program and build aircraft carriers, etc. - I think they can manage to pay the same as Canadians do to send a parcel. Then the goods they send here basically never get charge duty or taxes - in part because they routinely misstate the value on their customs declaration.\nHowever you are partly correct - Canada Post is very expensive for parcels. But note that couriers, e.g. Fedex and UPS, operating within Canada charge the same as Canada Post.\nPart of the reason for this is the couriers made a trade panel complaints about Canada Post subsidizing parcel rates and they won. That was right about the time Canada Post bought Purolator.",

Robert Mueller served the United States as a prosecutor working on cases including the prosecution of Manuel Noriega, mob boss John Gotti, and Pan Am Flight 103. He  sifted through the rubble of the Lockerbie bombing, including children's shoes and teddy bears. Robert Mueller served the United States as F.B.I. director, a position he accepted one week before 9/11. He served under two presidents from both parties, and had the longest tenure as F.B.I. director, second only to Hoover. Gingrich suggests that when it comes to Trump, however, Mueller is unable to operate objectively and is eager to abandon his integrity. Gingrich is acting like a surrogate stooge and should recall: \"Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity. Media should now calm down.” -Gingrich, May 17.",

He's still young and learning but I would rather have him than Dak.  116 QB rating- #7 for the week. He's still young and improving.  Watson did better but needs improvement.

Try simple meditation.... it's free.",

After the referendum was successful, Crimea's government applied for accession to Russia. Crimea was an unbound region at that time, not a part of Ukraine, as Ukraine had ceased to exist as a legal or constitutional entity when its constitution was rendered null and void in February 2014 - meaning, there were no Ukrainian laws, and no Ukrainian territory.\nThe outcome of the Crimea referendum has been confirmed as authentic by over a half-dozen international pollsters, and Crimea has invited the UN to visit and witness the situation.\nListen to what former CIA agent Ray McGovern has to say about what happened in Ukraine, and Russia's response:\nhttps://youtu.be/NeSfvA4cCtg",

Sometimes, the driver of the truck would forget or intentionally resort to having to use the reserve tank. The reserve tank is designed to be used for what ever purpose the owner would deem necessary. So it really doesn't matter, but one thing is certain, the reserve is not intended to be a savings account. This is why the PF has an earnings reserve account and there is a CBR; one is intended to reserve funds for payment of dividends and part for government spending, the other is for when ever the legislature deems necessary. \nPersonally, I would like to see spending and workforce reductions to 2009 levels prior to federal recovery programs, because we took hundreds of millions we really didn't need.

It is highly competitive and very impersonal.\n\nIt is the sort of management style that doesn't mesh well with Canadian tech workforces.  Obviously there are going to be some Canadians that would fit in perfectly at Amazon, but it isn't the sort of place that is likely to thrive in our culture.",

Allow me to provide a frame of reference for the author, before we find him teetering from some elevated landmark. In the Middle Ages, the average person lived to 31. I'm certain that the lack of proper medical care, clean water and general hygiene, and indentured service to the local lord may have affected that number. In the Industrial Revolution, people routinely worked 14-16 hour days in terrible conditions (smoke, dust, unsafe machinery). There were no sick days or holiday time (overtime pay? Seriously?).

For me, this issue comes down to integrity. The business community was sold a bill of goods by the city that this new tax was going to be used exclusively for arterial road repairs. They largely supported taking ownership of that infrastructure expense. The debt service piece was a city decision after the fact. There are two candidates who intend to honor the purpose of this tax - Swansen and Berrios. Berrios even had evidence at the debate to prove the original intent of B&O.  As a citizen and tax payer, wouldn't you want the leader of the city to keep their promises and not unfairly tax you because they cannot keep expenses in line?",

There is no benefit to allowing the car to idle to operating temperature compared to driving it under light load.  Both techniques warm the engine with very similar wear and tear on the engine.  The benefit of driving is simply that at least you're moving while you burn gas.\n2.  If you're idling the car to allow the interior to warm sufficiently to allow the interior of the car windows to defrost, the solution is found the night before.  For the last few hundred feet of your drive, open the windows.  This allows the humidity that has built up in the car to be removed.  There will be no moisture in the air to cause frost.  Of course, turn the defrost on in the morning to keep your breath away from windows.\n3.  Knock the snow of your boots before getting in the car to avoid the build-up of snow, which leads to water, which leads to humidity.",

This perversely incentivizes local law enforcement to confiscate suspect property even where state laws forbid the practice,”....\nIt's really far worse than you describe because there's never any court hearing, which constitutes a \"taking of property without due process of law\". Do we want our 'Justice' Department to violate our Constitution? Do we want our police departments stealing from us without any oversight? It's a 'slippery slope' to further violations of our rights such as eavesdropping on all of our telephone calls. \nWo0dy",

And any consideration of the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bees must also recognize the risks to pollinators which would occur should Canada shift to the use of older pesticides to protect food crops, as has occurred in Europe. There are major threats to bee vitality in Canada, but these are primarily pests like Varroa mites, viruses and other diseases, and indeed the pesticides which beekeepers use themselves - again as emphasized in the recent University of Guelph revue.",

A 60% margin was required for adoption.[7] Voters have also rejected proposals to repeal their state-level Blaine amendments in New York (1967), Michigan (1970), Oregon (1972), Washington state (1975), Alaska (1976), and Massachusetts (1986).[8]\"\nWikipedia",

Until the ONS publishes a monthly UK HICP with an owner-occcupied housing component based on the net acquisitions approach, the best monthly inflation measure for the Bank of England to target would be the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments and council tax with a formula effect adjustment. The inflation rate of this series was 3.2% in July, up from 3.0% in June. This estimate itself is on the low side, since the ONS hasn’t added stamp duty to the RPI as it should have done.

That's the way long term investments of this sort work. The current crisis we face is partly due to changes in economic growth and in returns on investments, but it is partly due to the legislature's attempts to further reduce PERS benefits in a way that violates law. We have had enough of that. The State has to look elsewhere besides old folks' retirements for new sources of revenue to pay the bills. Most PERS retirement benefits are quite modest.

Read about what St John Vianney, the patron saint of priests - said about how most bishops and priests are destined for hell for not preaching about it and leading their flock astray with liberalism.",

The geopolitical situation in 2027 might look very much like 1957.\"\n\nThe repeated accusation that \"the West\" is living in that past, hoping to revive the Cold War must be understood in light of a feature of Russian cultural psychology: if we accuse you of having raided the cherry orchard, we do so only to excuse ourselves in case you discover that the cherry orchard has been raided.",

When you consider A.L., it just codifies what a lot of priests do with divorced couples.  Once they have been married for a while, they privately bless the union and let them back into Communion - and without much investigation. That happens with civilly married Catholics who were not previously married.  I am sure it does or will happen with gay unions.

(Which is one of the reasons receiving our Lord at the rail instead of at the head of a queue is such a beautiful thing.)  It remains set aside for this purpose and few others even when Mass is not offered.  Typically when vespers or other hours are prayed they are only led from the sanctuary if led by a vested priest or deacon, and even then not always.  \n\nWhy open up the sanctuary for devotions that have for centuries taken place in the nave?  And where in the sanctuary do you intend for people to pray the rosary or stations?",

Even a cursory look at the basics, such as with their TSX TR ETF (HXT), makes the point that the prices roll in the distributions so that there's no periodic tax liability from monthly or quarterly payments. Instead, the unit price incorporates the dividends, and you settle up with the taxman via capital gains/losses when the holding is liquidated.\n\nIf you don't trust that the dividends are built-in, then so be it, but this makes for much less ACB bookkeeping, and may also be a relief from automatic tax withholdings in taxable accounts, though not sure how that works in international holdings.\n\nPoint is that no distributions may be a good thing, for tax reasons, and maintaining your ACB records for the CRA.\n\nMr. Pape's self-promotion often digs into ancient history to point out his old ideas, forgetting how acting at that time would have tanked for anyone who bit!",
