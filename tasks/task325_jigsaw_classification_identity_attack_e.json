And the issue is economic - if there was no social assistance and free money, they wouldn't come here - all the migration patterns show that the purpose is to get to countries with financial assistance, not to culturally similar regimes. People came to Canada originally for freedom, not economic reasons - now they come here for primarily economic reasons.  The real question for you is will you agree to have 4 billion people here? Can you afford to fund them all from your wage? Many of whom who believe that women are property and affect women's rights because of this perspective? If yes, open up your home to as many as you can and share all of your money with them.",

It was more than three months previous that the DOF had announced that their forecast deficit for 2014-15 was actually a $1.9B surplus and as we found out later the 2015-16 budget balance would have been a surplus if it hadn't been for the spend-like-drunken-sailors Liberals taking over, so Harper actually only had six deficits in his term in office.

Lisa's committee vote in favor of DeVos ensured her confirmation. Her \"no\" confirmation vote was meaningless and Murkowski knew it. You see...lockstep Lisa likes having it both ways. \n\nNothing in politics would make me happier than to see Murkowski vote against this abomination of bill.

Pretty unlikely. But the deep financial hole left over from the conservatives cannot be blamed on the NDP.

Tom Doyle may be the only priest I have ever heard anything from that addresses why so many victims could not come forward.

I get on an intellectual level why the Church CAN NOT DEAL WITH THIS ASPECT, and yet, it is such a disservice to the children abused by priests.

Instead of wailing about what it costs the country when some union goes on strike - do the math. That cost - the total combined cost to the ENTIRE economy that their strike imposed, is the actual value of their labour TO the economy.\nNow subtract their actual wages from that cost - and if the difference is too large, you understand two things (1) why strikes are needed and (2) just how severe the theft of capitalism truly is.\n\nIt is impossible, through the mere withdrawel of labour, to cost the economy one cent more than the VALUE of your labour.",

The flag is just bits of red, white, and blue cloth - and what it theoretically stands for is trashed daily by the very people who claim to love it so much.  I personally stopped displaying the flag when the right wing bigots claimed it for themselves (1970s).  It's my flag too but to too many people it stands for bigotry and racism and at this point I don't want to be associated with it and I don't want to be associated with anything that strips people of their right to protest - bye bye NFL in my life - the sport is too violent anyhow.",

You didn't see whites hit the streets stealing and burning after Reginal Denny was pulled out of his truck by blacks . Nor did they riot or protest when O.J. was found innocent . Blacks celebrated someone getting away with murder .   Where are Black Lives Matters leaders this weekend as blacks slaughter more blacks in Chicago ?  Where's the march over that ?

I noticed my recently deceased grandmother's purse that she was carrying was pretty heavy. I opened it and found Grandma's 38 special... loaded.  Grandma bought the gun after she was terrified by a heroin addict who kicked in her front door, rampaged through her house and fried to escape by jumping out of her bathroom window. The cops caught him.  Luckily my daughter never hurt herself or anyone else.  \nI've had NRA training in High School, believe it or not, and realize that gun safety is the first and last lesson they teach.

However when you have much of the western world reporting the same problems, you can down one road and say that the whole world is experiencing group  Islamaphobia, or you can down the other road and question whether the problems Muslims are facing are due in part to their failure to fully adapt to the society they live in .",

That is, no-one is baptised without there being touching which makes touching part of the sacrament.\n- So it could follow, theologically that holding hands (touching) during prayer has a baptismal connection.

In their native countries they would be raped and murdered for not wearing them. Islam as it exists today is a pestilence on humanity. Of course there are many wonderful people who are Muslims. There were a lot of charming German Nazis too. But Muslims belong to a cult whose basic tenant is that anyone who is not Muslim is sub-human and can be enslaved and murdered with impunity. That is a fact. It is a cult which deems women as property belonging to men - first their father and brothers, then their husband. If those men decide the behavior of a woman has dishonored them they are free to murder her. The worst problem with Islam today is that it encourages women to have as many babies as possible.",

A legitimate demonstration honestly announces what it is and why, usually ahead of time. A \"stunt\" misrepresents some significant part of the event. In this case, Pence tried to claim that he had gone there to watch the game, and that his walkout was a spontaneous reaction to the kneeling. We have since learned that neither was the case.

Canada vets immigrants through the same rigorous system of highly trained interviews, checks and balances as the US.  Sayfullo Saipov was radicalized years after arriving in the US.  So were others like him (i.e. Boston Marathon bombers).  It simply is not safe to allow Muslims into our country regardless of how rigorous the vetting is. You cannot prevent them or their children from becoming radicalized by groups like ISIS after they become Canadian citizens. When a local Muslim immigrant gets radicalized and  mows down your children with a UPS truck or rips a bomb off at a concert and kills your children in Canada then will you think differently? All nationalities, and all cultures are welcome in Canada, but I say stop it before it happens - NO to immigration of any kind for ALL Muslims from any country period. Enough is enough!",

Well, when bases his opinion or belief of something as crystal clear as”homosexual behavior is sinful”, is it obstinacy or principled dissent?  And why do you think we should be tolerant of sin?  That certainly isn’t Christ-like, being as that Christ admonished everyone to “sin no more.”  You are the obstinate bigot here, clearly.",

After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

The way to get that money for defense industry spending -  create more fear of foriegn enemies, nothing like a good conflict to jack up fear and a willingness to spend ever more on tghe MIC.  To sustain spending, the MIC needs war to expend current inventory that they want to replace.   \n\nSo that's three guesses.    Again, I hope your right.

(2) only small, single site organizations can have \"constantly shifting\" teams that are \"physically working together\". Larger organizations without work from home flexibility will have a poor choice between static un-shifting teams or co-located teams without the best talent. Whereas, flexible work allows physically separated teams with the best talent. I think talent will beat physical distance every time. Finally, managers such as Laermer are great at devising strategy and solving org problems in short stints, where as the teams he manages should be solving long term, solitary thinking problems.

He had been, it was discovered, doing so for years, but it only \"blew up\" when a former resident/victim reported it years after he had been victimized.  IMO, the director's actions were as horrible before they were exposed as after.  I admit, this is an EXTREME example.

But I think he needs to go a bit nuclear on the hitting.  It's a bit surprising that he's never settled on his clean up guy.  Cargo was in there for a long time, which I never understood.  But lately, Reynolds isn't moving guys too well, which is a big factor in so many games starting with runners LOB after the first inning.\n\nBlackmon clearly knows what to do mentally when guys are on base.  Why not put him at clean up?  If not, what about Tapia? They do have a few guys who are hitting well, but they're too unevenly distributed. It also doesn't help that Wolters is in a mini-slump.

Every so often, the host body fails and the alien has to find a new host. Dr. Crusher knew this and had told herself she was prepared for it. At the end of the episode, the alien gets a new host body, and rings Dr. Crusher's door. It turns out the host is female. Roll credits.",

Brings to mind the case of Bishop Olmstead's excommunication of the nun who led a hospital ethics committee who allowed and abortion to occur in the case of a mother of 4 at 12 weeks gestation who was intubated and diving in the ICU because of pulmonary hypertension.

You see, AA was founded in 1935 and has literally not changed the first 164 pages of the big book in all this time, regardless of how much knowledge we have gained around alcoholism and drug addiction.   There are numerous other avenues to  getting and staying sober and I would encourage people to try other programs or methods rather than buy into the 12 step religion.

Pres. Trump needed to be more definitive in his statements about white supremacists and their violence. But to say, as a counter, that the GOP should take up the words of a Democrat who has expressed this, and then had to backtrack this statement a day later because, really, as a State Senator you should probably be a little more high brow than being the mouthpiece of Air America and their liberal bent - that is a little too low brow for even you, Mr. Borrecca. \n\nHere is a hint if you want everyone to start saying \"he is not my president\" - tell everyone about this in about 3 years when we are all looking at the candidates, and implore everyone to vote. That is the only real way to say \"he ain't my president\".",

I don't know your age, but when I was younger, the amount of money needed to run a campaign was far smaller and could be raised by people wishing to serve their  community.  You had to have lots of popular support, not a few Super Pacs or corporations with their deep pockets.  Given the paucity of funds, they were used to debate issues, not to commit personal assassination or to make grandiose promises that could not be met.",

This catastrophic loss of moral authority and persuasiveness has compounded itself by staggering proportions with the utter disaster of clerical sexual abuse of children. \n\nThe hierarchy of the Church, apart from its magnificent track record of Social Gospel teaching, should  shut up on matters of sexuality and sexual morality for at least five hundred years while it does a lengthy silent retreat, meditating on its own moral congruence and accountability to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.",

There is no question about many of them having served with honor and distinction, but they did so serving in positions aligned with their sex at birth and wore uniforms consistent with their biological sex, of which there are only two, male and female.  However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

She said the IHS shelters are full of bed bugs, most people she knows use them only as a last resort because they are so gross. I said that I disagree with the sweeps, and wondered what she wishes the City would invest in to actually help people like her. She praised the efforts to get people into homes. But added that \"people like me\" - who have extremely bad credit - will never get approved for rentals, and never get hired for job - after years of trying, she felt there is little point in trying. So two things occur to me: 1. Why does IHS have a near-monopoly on homeless services in Honolulu? Their \"make people bottom out\" philosophy is so harsh and judgey. 2.

Islam in North America is called the \"Religion of Peace\" but their Mid East roots do not support this assumption. Islam is a Political entity that must rule not just be a Religion as we see everywhere it dominates as in many African and all Mid Eastern Countries. These Countries have blasphemy laws protecting only Islam, WHY?? They are expecting those same laws of protection as we see now being put forward by Islamic people in our political system.

But these idiots - criminals, actually - who feel some moral obligation to skip paying taxes so that they can help\"people in need\" - well, lets hope they go down first in the impending shakeout.\n\nLet's stop pretending marijuana is at all expensive, too.  A gram of bud - $15 if you want to splurge - will keep two people buzzed for a couple of days. A $15 bottle of wine will only give a couple hours buzz for the same two people. The only reason people are complaining about the cost of pot is because they are at the bottom of the economic ladder, precisely because of that cheap weed they've been consuming for years.",

The assailant attempted to seize the officer's gun. The officer shot the assailant, who was on top of the officer, in the patrol car. The MO AG Office, MO State Patrol, FBI, ATF, and DOJ all meticulously reviewed all of the evidence and cleared the officer who was defending himself during a felony assault. The assailant earlier robbed a store by physical force. \n\nObama famously said that Trayvon Martin \"could've been my son or me.\" The facts and evidence showed that two neighbors, Martin and Zimmerman, got into an argument that escalated into a physical assault. Zimmerman, half-Caucasian and half-Hispanic, shot and killed Martin in self-defense. So an idiotic beef between two neighbors ended up in physical violence and death. Yet DP and the MSM entire narrative is that Caucasians randomly murder black people.",

If forensic pathologists and anthropologists can usually determine the 'races' of centuries-old corpses, one would think this should be possible in the immediate aftermath of a police shooting.\n\nDon't insult our intelligence, Paul--put a little more effort into your lies.",

Apparently, for this baker, the definitive factor on if he will get into heaven or not is if he ever baked a cake that was later on used in a gay wedding.\n\nAnd I agree - if the couple had wanted some image on the cake that the baker found offensive, or was not a normal image/item that he had used in the past for other wedding cakes, and the baker refused on those grounds, I would be much more inclined to side with the baker.

The thing is...the republican party is completely incapable of changing or adapting because at its core its full of old white people who continue to cling the outdated ideals that resemble that of the old traitorous confederacy. \n\nThese old white folks were dragged kicking and screaming from the Jim Crow era into a post civil rights / voting rights America. They resented it then but for years it wasn't cool to make a lot of noise about it so they kind of kept a lid on it. Then Trump came along and released them from the bonds of their self-imposed \"political correctness\". \n\nIn the end, Donald Trump isn't problem with the republican party. The problem is that the party is full of republicans.

The arrows on the road point towards the middle and the white dashed lane dividing line disappears, and then the road narrows.

A Pope who is called \"a goddamn socialist\" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating \"economic Americhristianity\", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

Mahalo for your efforts and concern.\n\nFormer Hawaii Supreme Court Associate Justice Steven Levinson is a wonderful advocate for the public. I admire him.\n\nI'm still convinced that we cannot afford another 4 years of Mayor Caldwell. \n\nHis record - from ethics to pay to play to bullying to retaliation to fiscal mismanagement etc etc is too alarming and horrible to give him another term.",

And the idea of it being unsafe is only true if drivers feel like ramming me from behind when i'm right in front.  Hasn't happened in 55 years of riding.  Not even close.  Maybe you drive differently.\nPassing is simple too.  Anyone passing me under any circumstances with less than a meter of clearance is breaking the law.  Doesn't matter where i am in the lane.",

Give me a break.\n\n\"Buying insurance across state lines is unlikely because of the state's [Alaska's] high [medical] costs.\"\n\nNo, this has to happen. Solution: Allow the buying of insurance across state lines AND require medical costs covered by insurance to be the weighted average, based on population, of costs between states. The population of Washington and Oregon is 11 million. Alaska is 700K+. So the medical costs allowed for Alaska would be pegged at 6.3% higher than Washington + Oregon averages.",

Kellum is opposed to equity and diversity and the people who support them? What could that even mean, to say that you are opposed to diversity and equity? Or is he opposed to the language as it is proposed for the code, the way the terms \"equity\" and \"diversity\" are used there? Why would he be?

Does the author able to comprehend the basic concept that the European settlers in the past basically robbed the land from the First Nation people and drove them out of their own home?  I agree Canadians should not feel ashamed of their history, but we should acknowledge and learn from the mistakes and acknowledge the vast contributions of non-white Canadians who had contributed so much in building this country.   And stop denying the rights of non-white people in this country as Canadian as yourself.",

As of July 1, 2017, subject to extremely limited exceptions, private possession of a \"Large-Capacity Magazine\" (more than 10 rounds) is illegal in CA. Prior to that, CA law prohibited the sale/transfer of LCMs, but grandfathered those magazines already owned. Owners of LCMs were given 3 \"options\":\n1. surrender the LCM to law enforcement\n2. sell the now-worthless LCM to a licensed firearms dealer\n3. remove the LCM from the state\nIf you're caught with an LCM, you go to jail.

I, for one, think we should be doing everything we can as Alaskans to maintain a robust medical community here in the State.

Sadly, it needed 4 quarters to win and we lost because of that. \n\nSpecial Teams: C - The fake punt really wasn't the Special Teams fault as much as it was the coaching's fault. Otherwise, their play was uninspired. \n\nCoaching: D - The coaching was horrible. Players made stupid mistakes that should have been coached out of them.

I passed the state test.  Took me 19 minutes to complete. It had been predicted that this law would result in a dearth of managers, and that has happened.  I see no reason to keep the law.\n\nThe real problem with common-interest communities is the boards, or, more specifically, the directors on those boards.  They are the ones who make the decisions, not the managers.  The managers usually just do as instructed.  What is needed is some way to hold directors responsible for their actions. \nAlso, what is needed is a mandatory and binding dispute-resolution process to settle disputes.",

Some estimates have oil going much higher than this conservative analysis:\n\n\"Wood Mackenzie sees the oil market tightening this year, boosting prices in the second half of 2016. This scenario would also prove a boon to M&A activity. “As we saw in Q2 2015, when sentiment takes hold that oil prices are on the path to recovery, M&A activity can pick up quickly. First mover advantage is key – securing deals before competition grows and inflation sets in. At the moment, companies are focused on survival, but this could quickly shift back to growth in a higher oil price environment,” Mr Aitken said.\"\n\nhttp://www.drillingcontractor.org/wood-mackenzie-oil-gas-ma-to-ramp-up-in-2016-as-financial-pressures-drive-companies-into-action-37838",

Since the church still officially teaches that being gay is \"objectively disordered\" and \"intrinsically evil,\" thereby intentionally instilling shame in those so \"afflicted,\" few priests will ever admit to being gay if they still want to collect a paycheck, which the vast majority need to do in order to survive in this cold, cruel world. Even on National Coming Out Day (whenever that is) such a mass exodus from the priestly closet is highly unlikely. Now if the church were ever to change its tune in terms of doctrinal teaching then I suspect such an exodus is more likely, though it would probably begin more as a trickle  than a deluge.",

Whether their votes are relevant or not is purely dependent on how the numbers add up (if that's what you mean by relevant).  When Reagan won 49 states in 1984, none of the states were really \"relevant\" in terms of one or two potentially changing the outcome.\n\nBut \"relevant\" or not, all votes still count.

So why is it ok for Muslims to discriminate and no one bats and eye, it barely makes headlines on B listed news sites but when a Christian does it, it becomes a national event just because someone you don't know was slighted and is it really a big deal that someone said \"Hey, can you do this for us?\" and the dude replied \"No.\"",

And at the top of that heap is Kaepernick.\n\nAs for regular protests in the streets, I have no real problem with that... as long as they stay respectful of others, respectful of the law, non-violent, and non-destructive.  But I DO have a problem with their actions when they get violent, destroy others' property, riot, etc.",

He has issued non-stop white supremacist dog whistles at his rallies about \"dangerous\" blacks and immigrants.  He was enthusiastically supported by the KKK's David Duke, who celebrated his promise to \"Take America Back.\"  The first of Donald's three wives, Ivana, said that he kept a copy of Hilter's speeches in his bed table. His father was a Klan member. He has selected a known white supremacist, Steve Bannon,  to be his Chief Strategist.  The FBI has already reported a sharp increase in the number of  hate crimes against Muslims, Jews, immigrants and other minorities from those emboldened by his rhetoric. These people  are afraid for their safety.  He has also degraded & demeaned women on a regular basis. Wake up!

So, the latest proposal I have heard is to feed 99 using 13th/11th to Chambers (from the downtown station), and feeding West 11th from 6th/7th to Garfield.  That means buses will crisscross on two parallel streets, only two blocks apart.  \n\nMaybe they should have planned the overall system first, to avoid the apparent crisscrossing on the five block sections of Chambers and Garfield.  West 11th should be feed by 13th/11th, but the city council rejected that alternative several years ago; setting-up an appearance of halves of two different routes.\n\nWith all the years of planning, meetings, expense, etc. I now think the 6th/7th & W. 11th route never should have been available to the council.",

If what they came back to wasn't any better than the hopelessness they had in Vietnam, though, they would have continued as addicts.\n\nLook at so many vets today and in the past that have slipped through the cracks after their service.
