The issue is that these nurses were not looking at this man's genitals for medical purposes. They were doing it because they wanted to, to satisfy a personal desire. The article is not, \"Nurses open body bag to examine strange growths on a patient's genitals\" or something along those lines.

The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

These ideas, promulgated by heretics and paganss, were taken up by Christian ascetics who also distrusted pleasure. Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

Of course, he was also different in his incredible ability to heal.  One can not expect that of everyone.\n\nAs to your third sentence, \"I think it boils down to a diluted understanding of what love...\"  That expresses what a lot of married laity think is what is lacking in single priests.\n\nI am pleased that you have \"the sixties\" in quotes as sociological research then, and now, shows that the \"sex revolution\" occurred in the seventies.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

VPOs get a lot less training, & none of it is from the state that I know of. VPOs get lower pay, & VPOs are not officially recognized by the state due to the state's  opposition to tribal sovereignty. VPOs are paid & supervised by tribal councils. VPOs have high turnover & are often very young guys. VPSOs are meant to be a career option & have longer term professionals, generally.

People can use each other, people can have sex thinking only of their own pleasure, people can abuse or rape. Those are perversions. Anal intercourse or oral sex are not perversions as long as both partners are willing and enjoy it. \n\nThe ideal, however, is that sexual activity be between two monogamous people who love each other.

Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to. Yet women are encouraged to be 'adult' by becoming sexualized - by having sex. How great is that? Ask, who benefits, and how.",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?\nTrump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites. Sorry, but I believe it's not unreasonable to expect people to control their sexual urges. It's not okay to commit sexual assault and it's not okay to visit a prostitute.",

We now know pedophilia is intractable, but ephebophilia behavior is more complex. Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy.

We conclude that the district court did not err in applying the sixteen-level enhancement because, under the modified categorical approach, Rocha-Alvarado’s prior conviction for attempted sexual abuse in the first degree pursuant to Oregon Revised Statutes § 163.427(1)(a) qualifies as a “crime of violence\".\"\n\nRocha-Alvarado was charged with three counts of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree, alleging that on or between March 24, 2012, and August 29, 2012, he subjected a nine-year-old girl to sexual contact by touching her vagina, breast, and lips.\n\nHe was deported in 2013 and this is his sentence for coming back in after deportation.",

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

Isolated women will turn prison gay way quickier than men.

As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

Birth control also helps to regulate periods of women with unpredictable patterns of menstruation.\n3) PP provides sex education and safe sex supplies which are also used to prevent pregnancy and help people learn about their bodies.

No amount of sensationalist headlines and reporting is going to chance the fact that cat feces is the cause for an extremely small percentage of human contraction of the parasite. To contract toxoplasmosis from cats means a human is somehow ingesting infected cat feces (and a very small percentage of cats even have it to begin with).

I haven't heard or read it. And if we hit the electoral reform \"button\" it will automatically trigger the question of an elected or abolished Senate.

They both made me cry. I wanted to say something to both of them but it would have been out of turn and Stowers can get so nasty and then I would have to loudly say something about lack of justice.

They have no idea what their misguided decisions are doing. For example, at least one business owner in the Whiteaker is now considering leaving after fifteen years (his business will likely fail when he leaves, causing twenty people to lose their jobs). I have decided against expanding my business in the Whiteaker, which means six people who would have had paychecks won't get them from me.

A bunch of blue states have passed this and no red or swing states, so, don't hold your breath.\nIt doesn't matter whether the electorate understood that a vote for a GOP house member meant a vote for Paul Ryan because that's what it equated to. \nAnd as I said GOP House Members are the craziest, conspiracy theory, creationist, misogynist nutcakes out there.  Obviously that was not a deal breaker for the majority of Americans,",

She had a sister that went over to Seventh-day Adventist and she made fun of the sister about that, but mom still loved her sister.  BTW, the latest Noah movie is a hoot. I found much humor in it. I especially enjoy the creature that was fighting off the people trying to get on-board. I have yet to decide if Genesis or Revelations is the most ridiculous, but they are both really far-out.",

He left us with a sucking, caving financial collapse, and unemployment by the hundreds of thousands a month and two unfunded wars bleeding us dry.  We were spinning into the ground with no power.  Obama stepped in and saved our behinds restarting our engines, powering back up.  We've been gaining altitude since despite the total counter intentions and acions of the US House and Senate.  The legislature didn't help at all and should be branded traitors for the lack of care and consideration they gave to this country after the catastrophic GW Bush's presidency.  Their avowed promise and purpose was to impedePresident Obama any way they could whether it harmed the country or not.

Also, look at the context for the US abstention; there is absolutely zero happening to move peace forward, and a consensual peace has to be the goal. Also, the rate of settlement is INCREASING. 100,000 new settlers, all illegal, since 2009. Shortly after the vote, Israel announced 6,000 new settlers, and 600 new settlements in East Jerusalem, on hold I believe but the point is the utterly corrupt Netanyahu and his cronies are continuing an illegal policy that simply makes the situation worse, and is opposed by a significant number of Israeli Jews themselves.

Since military power by itself is neither adequate nor welcome by their own people, they opted out for economic colonization backed by military power where and when needed. This is why globalization is there to pave the way for western banks and large companies to take over the world supported by the military here and there. This is also why western large business has so much power, rarely pay any taxes, and are not accountable unless something looks very bad in the public's eye. Even then, it's minimal punishment.

This works out to around $10 billion per year!\n\nHere's a little math to demonstrate the selective ignorance of Cravez.  When TAPS had just under 2 million barrels of throughput- at about $9 dollars per barrel, was that more, or less value, than TAPS (currently) running at about 540,000 barrels per day at $48 dollars per barrel (or more)?\n\n$18 million per day... versus  $25.9 million per day (currently).\n\nHuh.

That's the way the market works since the demand for health plans by people will still exist.  And when that finally becomes the norm (direct purchase of plans and services by individuals), more self-balancing finally occurs.

I felt guilt about abandoning my old tradition, so the idea that Catholicism was superior and right about everything helped to assuage that discomfort.  But as time went by, the imperfections of the Church as a human institution became impossible to ignore. I went through a faith crisis, became very angry and thought about leaving the Church.  I have come through the crisis with acceptance and resolution to be a witness to all the good and the bad in the Church.  The article's best line refers to the present tense, not the past tense.

Once commenters identify themselves, anybody can research their conflicts.

Case in point: A family purchases their house in Kerrisdale in 1970 for around $45, 000. They could sell it today for around $5m (a tear down no less). Their income has never been crazy and they worked hard to afford what was then a moderately expensive house and live in what is now a stratospherically expensive house. But their income tax report would be wildly out of line with the value of the house - they could never afford the same thing today. So, by all means nail people who are scamming the system, but there are many who have simply benefited by going about their business and using their house as it was meant to be used: as a home.",

But staying home to raise a family isn't a religious or cultural right. Rather it's an economic choice in this country. Most Canadians would surely agree that a woman has right to make such a choice provided the cost of that choice doesn't rest with taxpayers. Most women and families realize that obtaining and maintaining a North American standard of living and its associated materialistic aspects requires two working spouses unless one has a substantial income. Perhaps women who don't like this should examine their own values and expectations and particularly their own materialism before finding fault with the host culture.",

Do some hunters display trophies? Sure! Do others display \"trophies\" of their accomplishments? Actors?(oscars) Sports champions? etc.? Everyone I know who hunts does so for the meat. I'm sure that the same anti-hunting crowd are screaming about GMOs in their food! Well!? Think about it! I would also submit that most hunters never fill their tag every year. I haven't! Yet, I enjoy the outdoors, the companionship of friends, the solitude, and, yes, even watching wildlife without taking a shot, which happens a lot, because not EVERY animal is legal to be hunted.

Jefferson specifically mentions God and /or Natural Law as the source of our liberties and rights.

I have used the services of an advisor for 20 years and I often mentioned my concern with the low returns, but I knew little about investing and did not trust my intuition.  I felt it was safer to have a professional manage my money.  I regret not being more proactive and taking more time to learn about investments but it's never too late and it's great that there are so many on-line investment firms offering robo-advisory services.  I am 51 and excited to watch my portfolio grow.  I use BMO's robo-services and you can also set-up your own portfolio and purchase ETFs and stocks directly. I now pay $450 in annual fees and the $4,500 that I am savings is now going into my RRSPs rather than giving my money to someone else.  Best move I ever made.",

However with tanking oil revenue we can no longer gouge oil companies to pay sweet retirements of senior teachers in tier 1, 2, and 3 tiers.

Most teachers start teaching right out of college at around age 22 putting them at retirement at age 42. Plenty of time to collect a sweet retirement and pursue a couple more careers. Alaskans are faced with billions in unfunded pension liability. School districts run by the teachers union who wined, dined, and lobbied legislators for golden retirements. You are incorrect to say districts had no part in setting up Teachers Retirement System TRS. Teachers retiring in early 40s when they could serve our kids for another 40 years is a problem.

Their share of income taxes is nearly three times their share of income, and this ratio has been increasing every year since 2011.\n\nThe bottom 20% on the other hand made 4.5% of total US income and paid a negative tax rate- also known as a subsidy- of 2.2%. Not only did they not pay their fair share, they received other people's money back in the form of a check from the government that many would falsely label a \"tax refund\".

In reality, rotenone gives multivoltine invertebrates such as midges, blackflies, and Baetis mayflies a short-term advantage, as these invertebrates explode in biomass within weeks after rotenone treatment. Potassium permanganate is toxic, but for a duration, and it oxidizes rotenone within 30 minutes travel time. \n\nThe prodigious ability of aquatic invertebrates to recolonize following disturbance has been known to science following seminal studies in the 1960s.",

Those who are not seeking God, but who are instead focused on continuing their sin are in deep trouble.

When travelling back to WV during the shale fracking height, I heard many employers complaining about the need to bring workers in from OK or TX just to drive trucks carrying drilling mud.  So what came first, the chicken or the egg.  Potential WV workers turned to Meth because they could not get a job or they could not get a good paying job because they were already on Meth?  The jobs were there, still are laying pipelines to these new wells, but not coal.  The gas and oil is still there.  High sulfur WV coal was declining when I was a kid, the miners knew this. Meth and OxyContin have ravaged lots of towns, use of these drugs for an excuse is no excuse.",

Refugees from Middle Eastern countries - like war-torn Syria - are demanding they be allowed to go to Sweden or Finland because the terms of asylum are more favourable for them and the Danes don't provide enough benefits. \n\nHas it also occurred to the author how the US would react to Canada accepting the refugees they are turning away?

Second there are higher requirements in the form of background checks and registration to purchase than for non-automatic guns. Third, there are a very limited number, and they are registered, thus very expensive. So the idea that you can waltz into Joe's Guns and Stuff and walk out with an automatic weapons a half hour later is absurd. And if you are assuming machine gun when you talk automatic firearms, Joe hasn't been able to carry those since 1934. \n\nAnd now I wonder also what you mean by not bought by every person who passes background checks.

It was a two-party treaty that barred the US and the Soviet Union from deploying nationwide defenses against strategic ballistic missiles. It had nothing to do with North Korea or any other country.  There was another major international treaty called the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that was ratified by all but three countries.  North Korea ratified it in December 1985, but unilaterally withdrew from the treaty in April 2003, which has resulted in the problems we are having today.

The formula I gave, as well as the mandate and 22 million, is also is well stated in mainstream media if you do look into it.\n\n\nI don't like giving sites, I do read many sources and form my own opinions. Hopefully this foolishness of giving of sites, knowing many more exist that will differ, will be realized. You're right, people should do research.\n\nThank you!",

One pilot was able to land an out-of-fuel Boeing 767 on an abandoned runway because he had experience as a glider pilot.

In my experience, politicians are mainly concerned with the short-term goal of getting elected. Therefore, potentially controversial topics such as immigration are generally never addressed at all, or never discussed thoughtfully and realistically, in a balanced way, by any of the main political leaders. If the subject is discussed at all, we usually get a few brief slogans and platitudes, meant to gather votes in selected  jurisdictions. There is no long-term plan or foresight.  According to this simple way of thinking, having more and more people will lead to having more and more older adults who will need the support of more and more younger people and so the population should grow continuously and indefinitely. However, at some point this cycle has to stop, since  limitless and continuous population growth is clearly not possible forever in a world of finite resources.",

But the lack of any government regulations or restrictions of any kind on hunting led to its extinction too.\n\nShooting Buffalo became a big tourist industry.  People found it fun sport to kill them.",

Canadian warden station is located at Lake Lindeman and from the story, it appears that they were the careless ones. But bears in that area is quite rare since outside of careless Canadians, there really isn't any food to sustain a bear.  If they killed the suspected bear,,,,,why are the campgrounds still closed?? Panic move?\n\nI don't know why anyone want to bring a dog in this trail. Its a killer to the doggie's paws and on a hot days, heat stroke for a dog is just a paw away.\n\nThis is a real bummer to people who plan this hike since you have to reserved campgrounds ahead of time.

Now we lose at both high and low oil prices and will never be able to put money away even if oil rises to $100/bbl again. When the price of oil under ACES went up the state got a larger share of  the value of OUR oil. Under SB21 we receive the same tax rate as at low oil prices only now all fields developed since 2002 will be deemed \"new oil\" and taxed at the extremely low rate we see now at low oil prices.

If one person says something another person does not like, we have a very different situation.  True respect always works both ways.  This means that we allow people to speak their thoughts as long as those thoughts are not forcibly imposed on others.  To ban comments (which are purely comments and not forcible or power based actions which impose one's thoughts on others) is truly enslavement.  It is very difficult to grant respect.

It is also favoured by the politicians who buy votes by promising government benefits to people that the other guy has to pay for. It is used to reattribute the wealth from people who have worked for it to people who have not worked for it.

What seems so obvious to me is that when you witness such polarization in the discussion the best course of action is for someone, to move that the matter be referred back to the relevant committee for further study asking to take into account all the concerns raised. That document should not have been approved but sent back to be improved. The GC president himself could have taken the lead on that and made the motion. Failing all that, either Dr Ryan or the chair could have suggested it to the delegates. At any rate Dr Ryan did promise that this was the beginning of a process. The mere fact that consequences were not voted shows that this document is a work in progress. They are in uncharted waters and things must not be rushed.

I'll take it over the addictive and dangerous drugs, oxycodone and xanax. The 12 step program is for addicts and alcoholics. MJ is not physically addictive. Alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines and others are addictive and dangerous...especially most prescription drugs combined with alcohol. MJ, as far as I know, does not interact with other medications.

A younger man ordained by 30, with no family, will give 60+ hours to the priesthood, for 40+ years (setting retirement at 70); the older, still with family, ordained at 56, will give maybe 30 hours, for 14 years. Under this scenario, you need more than *five* older vocations to make up for the loss of the younger one. \n\nWill we get those five-plus older vocations for each younger one we lose?

In theory, this would make sense except that even the \"cheap\" rates for the young were too expenses when they factored in the deductibles, co-pays and the ability to go in and drop out of plans with relative ease.  This coupled with the rise of premiums at multiples of the inflation rate year after year should come as no surprise that ACA has this problem of getting the young and healthy to sign up and forcing more of the financial burden to older enrollees.  The alternative is a \"community rated\" premium system, which is done in states like NY, where everyone regardless of age pays the same rate.

What do you think that looks like? History has already shown us what that is and humanity, or rather Italians, gave it a name.",

Of course, the lawyers and the cops on the show take everything out of context and misinterpret everything and put the leader on trial for encouraging murder.   Out of context some of the language can be taken that way.",

You need to look at the root problem of the economics, the musher handler relationships that are illegal (cash under table room and board and so many times involve young people where your basically looking at teacher student scenarios) and prone for people to be taken advantage of. The political economic corruption of the sport wont get addressed and evolved into something more healthy and legitimate unless the media puts more pressure on the ITC. Paul Gebheardt who is quoted in this article shouldnt be on the ITC board as he has a habit of hiring women much younger than him and getting employee confused with date.

For millions in Asia, living at sea-level, dependent on the timely appearance of the monsoon, the problems of climate change are not sometime in the future. \n\nAre we ready to really get serious about nuclear energy? I agree that nuclear energy could be a vital part of the solution the problem of solving the world's energy needs while also limiting CO2 emissions. It could help solve the problem of energy poverty, which you note. But private business would need help. 85 % of France's nuclear power industry is owned by the government.",
