Civic engagement and, from the publication's perspective, the generation of incredibly valuable ledes. Remember the infamous W. Howard?

In fact it shows the opposite as the skirt would most definitely look different than it does if the back of it were being lifted AND he would have to be a freaking contortionist to touch a bare ass from that 'position' of his arm without lifting the skirt.  So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

Those standards have changed over the last 30 years. Most provinces have now moved minimum standards legislation to require that a member who leaves a plan after 2 years of participation are entitled to receive a pension benefit based on both employer and employee contributions. Some provinces now have immediate vesting of the benefit. So the 10 year rule in this comment is not accurate. \nI also question why an employee who has no or little experience with investing over the course of their career would expect to do better than people who do it for their living. Perhaps they feel better that they have control over their money, but the article suggests that people expect to make way more than is realistic. Most don't understand the huge impact that 2% fees charged have on the value of their benefit in the long term",

But too many places do not have such programs in place.

In my undergraduate program, I completed clinicals in all aspects. But one can practice as an RN with an Associate's Degree.

It is was visible on the base security video.\n\nAlso, in the same time frame, the US has established 10 small military bases in northern Syria close to the Turkish border.

Isn't that the point?  And if the government can't somehow provide a \"clear question\" on the issue, then they don't deserve ANY mandate.  \n\nTo add insult to injury, the PM decides he won't tell us himself--he gets a newly-installed neophyte--at 29, the youngest Minister in Canadian history--to do it.

However, this discrimination does not constitute any injustice because many faiths demand sacrifice.  So although I don't have a problem with changing this after women are ordained equally to men to the exact same unrestricted Holy Orders & Sacrament as celibate men, this should never be allowed before women are being ordained priests.

Even if they did not, N. Korean artillery and rocket fire could alone level Seoul and surrounding cities, not to mention a US military base of 30,000. The best strategy is to continue sanctions and blockades. A war with N. Korea would by Pyrrhic at best. And all of this assumes China will not involve itself which we cannot be certain of.",

Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks. Why can't you just get off your fat lazy butt & take the time to deliver it to the office rather then use an unnecessary service. Waste!",

But an honorable priest would be expected to adequately care for his \"wife\" and children, and this reality is tolerated because it is the people or community (sensus fiedelium) who not only support but at times require that a priest have an attachment.

With no memory of how things used to be for comparisons, they don't think outside the box, but just believe there is only one definition, or one responsibility based on one definition, or one value that is feasible, appropriate, right, even moral. This argument, about responsibility to stockholders being only profit, struck me as being one of them. It was used by Wall Street against Costco for a long time, and against Amazon, but their CEOs refused to buckle to the argument in favor of their long-range plans to build stronger companies.

Then when you file an appeal the PD lawyer working on it says cryptic little comments like he knows a secret about you and intentionally tanks the whole thing.

As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

I think humans will always find things to piss them off.  No matter how close to perfect life is, complainers will still be there.",

She either decided that I was lying or that it was my fault, and ceased being my friend.  The second time it was the partner of my long-time best friend.  I didn't tell her.  I figured she already knew what a skunk he was (everybody else knew it) so why should I add to her misery?  Later after she caught him in an affair with another woman and dumped him, I confided in her.  She was furious that I hadn't told her at the time.

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

Unfortunately, this transition demonstrated how far the economy has shifted during the Obama years. The only choices most folks have are debt slavery, wage slavery or joining the black market. Educational or entreprenuership opportunities without a commitment to debt or wage slavery have all but vanished. Small business as we've traditionally known it continues to evaporate. The University of Alaska's business programs are heavily weighted towards training people to work for someone else. Vince's past comments on this site are usually a thinly-veiled commercial for the \"work union, live better\" meme.

One on a larger lot with view just sold with a $2.6m asking price (sale price not known yet).\n Have the wealthy out of country buyers just moved east?

Instead the state should institute an income tax (weighted on the upper end earners) that pays entirely for the education system in Washington.

If the NPA declines to prosecute, nothing can be done about it except more  protesting....which has been shown to achieve very little.

If over the last 5 years about 60% of all condos have been purchased for rental purposes, as the data suggest, this implies that those condos aren't occupied by resident owners. Further, I suspect many of these units serve the short-term rental market as well as the hotel-style temporary rental market, which in the latter case is negatively impacting reasonably priced hotels and putting thousands of low-to-moderate income hotel staff out of work in the process. Not all condo rental activity serves the ordinary local rental housing markets in places like Vancouver and Toronto.",

I'm a 30 year old male. The way women dress in our society already has me breaking my neck and \"objectifying women\". Put a nice set of boobs in front of me and I know I'm going look and think sexual thoughts. Without that intention even. The woman in the article stated women should be able to be topless because men can do it. What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said \"object\". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S.",

They the second person speaks and tells their story, Same process, same repeat what you heard.... \n\nThe amazing thing about that type of mediation is the sense of a connection that it builds between the victim and the offender.   My roll was to keep the process in focus, not to solve the mediation.     It is amazing to see how many times the offender feels remorse (most had no idea of the effect of say a small robbery), and suggest a harsh correction in their 'contract' with the victim, only for the victim to forgive them and build a more relational solution.   We went from crime the start of friendship.\n\nThank you for this series Sharon",

No need for extra enforcement personnel because if you can't pay the tax, you can't buy the item. That's pretty simple!

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Example: Prostitution is an act upon the sexual appetite. Legalized prostitution reduces sexual assault, therefore sexual assault is an act on the sexual appetite. So, you think we should encourage one act (prostitution) to discourage another act (sexual assault) on the sexual appetite. Let's apply that idea. You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites. Sorry, but I believe it's not unreasonable to expect people to control their sexual urges. It's not okay to commit sexual assault and it's not okay to visit a prostitute.",

Father k. eventually left the sacristy, leaving myself and the other boy alone with Father. D. who was the associate pastor and the priest who was in charge of the altar boys. Father D. accused me and the other boy of stealing altar wine, which was not true. He told us we had two options: we could be thrown off the altar boys and expelled from school. Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked. Since I was the youngest, he chose me to be punished first. He had me lay across his lap while he proceeded to spank my bare bottom.",

I’m going to handle my business in school, then I’m going to handle my business on the field, and then the rest of the time I’m going to relax, have fun and enjoy it. But you’ve got to be able to put it all together.” Now there is a Senior who will succeed in life beyond football. Bravo.",

That is the TRUTH.  Half of the presumed highly educated commenters on this site have problems believing the simple tenets of the Catholic Faith. She is an expert in the New Testament, which is solely about Jesus, and she has not yet come to the conclusion that he even existed.  What the hell has she been studying?   It is simply a disgrace that young children learning to receive First Communion are more educated with the truth than the many on this website.",

Ontario's been taking out 30 year bonds lately, so today's rates are basically \"locked in\" until the 2040s, by which point inflation will have significantly diminished their impact. \n\nFor the same reason, if Ontario is issuing bonds today for 2.5%, and that goes up to 3.5, sounds like a hike, right?

Italy in 1490s was subdivided into various independent city states, often in constant warfare. Even the Pope had his own little nation called the Papal States. It was not unusual for Italians back then to offered their services to larger and more powerful Christian powers around Italy, like Spain, France or the Hapsburgs. They do so to escape the unending warfare in Italy. There is nothing wrong back then, for Italians to escaped the chaos of  constant warfare and take service in foreign lands.

I would be just as concerned about a republican doing the same things. Most republicans were actively supporting impeachment of Nixon. Republicans supported Gingrich resigning until it was found that he did nothing illegal or wrong. I have a very large problem with anyone who lies about anything and everything, over and over and do not care what party they are from, Trump included. I know that most politicians lie about a whole lot but Hillary takes lying to a whole new level.

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

This profile fits well with the modus operandi of the Federal Liberals that customarily campaign for election from the left and govern from the centre right (never more so than over the past 3 years).\n\nA leader with these traits (and the Party he/she leads) will experience wide swings as the public is drawn to and then put-off in cycles by such a leader.  We're just over the peak of the 'drawn to' phase at present with Trudeau and the Liberals.",

Washington State owns acreage in the Reserve, including Fort Ebey, Fort Casey, and Ebey's Landing State Parks. The Federal Government owns around 500 acres within Ebey's Reserve - around 2% of the total  Reserve. But the outlying field and the buildings around the field are not within the Reserve.  The field lies just east of the boundary.  \nThe Reserve and the Navy sometimes have conflicting missions.  Most would argue that operational expansion at the OLF as proposed in the draft EIS is one of those times.  That is why all of the Reserve partners, and many local concerned citizens, exercised their responsibility to submit comments to the EIS expressing their individual concerns about the proposed increase.  At this point we all hope the folks back in Virginia make the right decisions with the final document, based on the information they have spent so much time and energy to gather.",

When going in for surgery, the prescription is written early, so that the pills can be in hand immediately after the surgery, and it is written for a one month supply, since it cannot be refilled any sooner. If you need the painkillers for a shorter period of time, you are left with pills that you have paid for and probably won't dispose of them, because you might need them at some future date.This makes for a lot of opiod medications sitting in medicine cabinets.",

There was no statute of limitations for this sin/crime and the punishment for it was and still is, immediate excommunication. The lawyers thought that at last the victims were going to get some sort of justice.\n\nThey were wrong. Ratzinger himself imposed a statute of limitation on that particular crime.

I suspect that the total real dollar amount paid to the health care industry since passage of Obamacare has risen dramatically.  Yet, because of the partisan and special interest drive to obfuscate the matter, no one talks about such things.  Krugman, unfortunately, avoids the hard issues.  Obamacare does not address the overall cost issue in terms of actual annual net cost for health care.  As an economics Nobel, he owes us better.",

Then it cost us extra for the emissions tag when we renewed our registration. I don't know what sort of study Anchorage did before deciding to discontinue their program, but here in Fairbanks, a record check showed 98% of the cars were passing the tests without modification. So, basically, the emissions tests weren't catch many polluters but millions of dollars a year was being spent proving that we weren't polluting.\n\nThe \"broken windows\" theory of economics was eloquently refuted by Bastiat centuries ago.

Of course, it wouldn't have any room for the graft and corruption that the cement train has already built into it (went from $3B to $10B in feigned ignorance, bad luck, incompetence, and hidden meetings).

A full house is usually good for an extra goal and a half for home games , and would give the team an unearned boost.  Give students tickets and rides to the game for next weekend . Attendance could snowball upwards if a large crowd attends , as a large crowd makes games exciting to attend.  Plus they should ask / tell GCI to only show the game tape delayed.

The other instance was a rottweiler and a pitbull that were attacking a cow moose and her young calf. A person on scene had been trying to chase the dogs away unsuccessfully. The cow was bleeding from multiple bites. The person on scene knew where the owner lived. The owner was not home.  His dogs had broken loose before and threatened the neighbors.

That being said the effects of abusive colonialism cannot be erased in one generation. It might take as much as 140 years for places like Somalia, or Sierra Leone and others to stabilize and have legitimate governing systems and structures in place. There are many reasons why some places are so poor. Geographical location comes to mind. If one was unlucky enough to be born in a desert somewhere in Yemen in an area that hasn't seen any rain for two years plus no natural resources other than sand, there are very good chances people there will be poor and capitalism cannot be blamed for that.",

He’s a successful businessman and he’s got a plan that seems to be aggressive.”\n\nI wonder what George Schultze had his clients' money invested in the past 8 years.  The stock market had a phenomenal run from 2009 - 2016.  That's his bad dream!?\nContrast that to the record of the only public company Donald Trump ever ran - DJT.  It went public in 1995 raising $140 million from investors, lost money every year from 1995 - 2004 before finally filing for bankruptcy in 2005.\n\nThe notion that Trump is a successful business man is delusional.  What he is is a successful promoter, a la Don King.  If he has done well for himself it has been at the expense of others.  The business communities faith in him is badly misplaced.",

While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

About 260,000 people are now CPC members, up from around 100,000 just 4 months ago.  This is a record for the party, about double the previous membership high when the merged party had its convention in 2004.  Assuming the sizable majority vote in May, this means twice as many convention votes as in 2004 and 250% as many convention votes as the 100,000 who voted in 2013 for new Liberal leader Trudeau.\n\nSee the final 2 hour pre-convention debate tonight at 6 pm ET on CPAC to better assess the 14 candidates.

The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

So, the cost of panels can continue to fall and it won't really make any difference in the total cost of the project.\n\nWind/solar are only currently viable (with heavy government subsidies) in countries where land is cheap, labour costs are very low and the sun shines all the time.  Unfortunately, that rules out most of the US and Canada.  The author failed to mention that only 2% of wind/solar builds around the world are competitive w/o government subsidies and that is unlikely to change.\n\nNuclear backed up with clean burning natural gas and hydro (where avail.) are still the best option.",

Privatize Alaska State Ferry System. Reduce state regulation and cut every State regulatory agency funding by minimum 50% and personnel cut by 50%. Some agencies can go away completely. Shift prosecution of drug offenses to prosecution of theft offenses and impose real penalties for theft, fine thieves, ankle monitors and heavy fines, incarceration only for repeat offenders. It does not make sense to establish state bureaucracies to tax us $1,000 that we have to pay fed tax on, and then turn around and give us $1,000 PFD that we have to pay fed tax on. We have grown government agencies well manned and well funded for 40 years. Time to swing the pendulum back the other way.",

Those times have changed...women are \"liberated\" and premarital sex is accepted for both genders.  Additionally, of course, there are more couples living together unmarried than there are married and, not surprisingly, more children being born to unmarried couples than married couples.  Indeed, times have changed.  \n\nIt always amazes me that those who scream the loudest against abortions are frequently the same ones who scream just as loudly against contraception...Bill advocates for \"abstainance only\" birth control....perhaps he should ask Sarah Palin and daughter Bristol, two of the A.Os leading advocates, how successfully it works......Gary Crum",

When Trump said a woman who gets an abortion must be punished, he got the Right to Life vote. \nAnd no, they should not have voted for Hillary either. All I would ask is that they admit they are not so pious as they profess (but then deny because they are \"humble before God).\nTrump is a narcissist who even complained that he got Person of the Year instead of Man of the Year. Winning for him is empty because he beat losers.",

Korea imports from China twice what it exports to China.\n\nTibet's been a disputed region of the Chinese/Mongol empire since the 7th century.  Tibet was under rule by a group of locals put in power by China.  Arguably Tibet started it by expelling Chinese when Mao took over.  BTW, 87,000 Tibetians died in that initial war, far less than the 300,000 we killed with our Iraq war.\n\nNope.  We're not better; today we're arguably worse than China in some ways.",

There's nothing to \"buy into\" either. The facts are clear and supported by hard evidence.\n\"Sex offenders are overwhelmingly white males.  Nearly 99% of sex offenders in single-victim incidents were male and 6 in 10 were white (Greenfeld, 1997).\"\nSurveys have consistently reported that college men acknowledged forced intercourse at a rate of 5-15% and college sexual aggression at a rate of 15-25% (Koss, Gidycz, and Wisniewski, 1987; Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, and Tanaka, 1991).\nThe national survey of rape conducted by Koss et al.
