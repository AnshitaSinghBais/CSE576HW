Reasonable people would never vote for him again.\n\nOn this pork project alone, Caldwell has wasted about $4.6Million of federal HUD CDBG ( Common Development Block Grants) money that are meant to help non-profits that serve the homeless, domestic abuse, women, children, HIV/AIDS etc and low-income communities like Hauula.\n\nQueen Antoinette Caldwell is forcing \"cake\" on the people when they want \"bread\".",

As a 50's univ. student the preference for \"enlightened despotism\" as a form of gov. was a given. So, a \"trump\" as leader of a democracy is simply a demonstration of its perniciousness, his demagoguery an added bonus. Support for key institutional issues - abortion, homophob. and misog. warrant reciprocal pandering and \"overlook\" rather than \"oversight\" of vices, lie, self-serving abuse of all kinds.\n\"Republican\" and \"Democrat\" are mostly mislabeling and muddying the water and oil.

I can live in rural Alaska with no problem because I have the experience, the snow makes the difference. Life is even better there as it was not with mine, with electricity around or a generator as substitute.

It similarly ignores Canada's excessive historical and per capita emissions, and the political and moral necessity for \"contraction and convergence\" in which countries with the highest emissions cut fastest and deepest. He also ignores the cost of locking in high-carbon infrastructure like pipelines which are economically intended to run for decades, but will need to be shut down early as part of concerted global climate action. Leach's \"take what you can get, we could do less\" message is an unsatisfactory response to the urgent challenge of climate change, and its not one that Trudeau or Canadians should accept.\n\nMilan Ilnyckyj\nToronto",

What I do care about is that a lot of people in our state are going to suffer at the hands of Big Oil, and our governor is ok with that. I voted for a Walker and generally agree with his agenda, but he is dead wrong on this one. I think Clem Tillion said recently to leave the PF and PFD alone, there are 49 other states that deal with their budget without a permanent fund to fall back on. We all (including Governor Walker) need to ask ourselves, how would we do this if we didn't have a PF bail to us out? I don't have an answer to that question, but I can say with certainty that Alaska wouldn't cease to exist because we didn't have a PF. Walker and this oil soaked legislative majority need to stop trying so hard to appease the oil companies and start doing the job that they were elected to do, represent us, the people.",

When your enemy has a gun pointed at your head you can either fight back or let them kill you. With my enemy, Republicans, I'd rather fight back. Hence the rationale behind my comment.

I agree with your point about appropriation being an artifact of power dynamics and that it is not reversible; if the hegemony coopts a story from a subjugated people, the risk of appropriation is quite high. Almost (but not completely) unavoidable. If a subjugated people tells a story not their own, on the other hand, cultural appropriation is less of a pitfall (though not absolutely zero). And in the case of multimillion-dollar feature films, the profits benefit the studio, not the culture from which the story comes--this, to me, is the biggest issue.  \n\nHowever, it does not follow that because there are a lot of Jewish people in Hollywood, a film made by a non-Jew about the Holocaust would (or wouldn't) be a form of appropriation. That is a non-sequitur that itself borders on racist, though I don't think you meant it that way.

Once he heals this off season with recovery training he should be good to go next year. \n\nCharles is only 30 years old which isn't physically too old, even for a RB.  The reason people think Charles is done is because he had his injuries one after the other which kept him out most of the last two seasons. But it is not uncommon for one ACL to fail and then the other to follow in a few years.  However, once both ACL's have been surgically repaired, he should be fine.\n\nI think people will be shocked at just how much better a back Charles is than CJ.

A proposal of marriage as the only acceptable life for women (a la Martin Luther) can be contrived as a sexist's dream of permanently tying up women's existence to male provision, child rearing, and a general stifling of their education. \n\nMaybe you can explain your claim a bit more",

One proposal is to build another bridge north of I 105 at Willamette that would have a lower speed for \"local\" traffic. That may help. However, it would work against the idea that we should build neighborhood nodes so people don't have to drive far and can in fact walk sometime. It would make it easier to drive to the Delta area for shopping instead of spending money in one's community. \nIf people want to fund Beltline, let's vote on it. I hear the call to vote on road improvements such as South Willamette and the West 11th EmX. Get a petition and get signatures. \nMultnomah County added a $19 registration fee and used a variety of other sources to fix the Sellwood bridge which cost $324 million.  Let's do the same! If 100,000 motorists in Lane County paid $30 we'd raise $300 million overnight!\nWho is ready to quit complaining and start the process?",

PF is encouraging Christians to cooperate with God more effectively so as to redeem human power on Earth by aligning it in consilience with its rightful origin in the Kingdom of God, seems to me. That power has been usurped for millennia. \n\nYour cynicism can get tiresome.",

The only way he can force the hand of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, is to declare the program to end in 6 months.\nThis way both parties are responsible if there is no legislation passed to help them.  No one wants the blame for not creating a clear path to citizenship for these mostly contributory young folks that by no fault of theirs were brought here.

Guiding me in my vocation-quest at this time was the Prefect of Seminarians, Father John Musinsky, SVD, (now deceased) who later became the first American Superior General of The Society of The Divine Word.\n\nIn the Fall of 1956, he urged me to continue theology studies, which I agreed to. Early in the first semester he served notice on all First Year Theologians that by mid-semester, each was to engage in serious writing of a Paper on some significant theological topic of personal choosing. The topic of my choice was “Religion: A Rational Consideration of the Basic Relationship of Creation to the Creator”, which maturing experience was a motivating factor in my decision to return to common family life.

Hawaiians believe in living \"pono\" or in balance with the world around you. It isn't an exaggeration. It is a belief. You can keep arguing until you are blue in the face, but that doesn't change their belief that TMT is upsetting the balance of a sacred site. Instead of criticizing people for having different beliefs than yours, how about you read up about them and educate yourself. On the other hand, I would like to see a proposal of TMT taking over the place of the 4 observatories that are being dismantled.

One of the best homilies I ever heard was from a priest in a former parish many years ago.

It was very affirming to hear him admitting lots of sins in our institutional past, yet reminding us that Christ still bears with us. He did, after all, promise to be with us always.\n\nOur hope IMHO lies in the many really good priests as well as wonderful, loving lay people in our midst. Most of the priests I've known labor ceaselessly in their efforts to bring the Gospel to life for us in the pews. As for the bishops, I've had issues with many of them but have to admit they have a near impossible job, and they are worthy of mercy as well as the rest of us.\n\nDoesn't mean that we shouldn't work for effective change!",

The last thing Canada needs is the balkanization of Parliament that proportional representation would have brought, the legitimization of any movement of any size from White Supremacists to Islamic Brotherhood and everything in between.  The best way is to have a strong, national government of Liberals or Conservatives, let them do what they want, and then every 4 years the voters can either toss them out or give them another mandate.

The vast majority of those insured were happy with the insurance they had before the ACA. If the number of uninsured was 35 million, that would be 10%, at 45 million, it would be 13%. The figure of 85% of the population liking their insurance is completely plausible and credible.

Their greatest leader before they finally lost out was General Robert E. Lee (Queen Lili'uokalani).  There's a statue of the great leader where diehard deadenders of the now-defunct nation continue to have racist political rallies supporting white (Hawaiian) nationalism more than a century later.  \"The Sahth (Hawaiian Kingdom) shall rahs agin!\"  Now just suppose the Hawaii (Charlottesville) government decides to encourage multiracial unity and equality by removing the offending statue.

The latter point was included the in the changes to UK law in 2003, but did not increase rape reporting because it is such a rare reason for rape being reported.",

Next time she saw it running deer, she did. \n\nVermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. They are serious about threats. We just want to feel good about ourselves. If we were serious about feral cats, we would kill them. Neutered cats eat birds. Don't release them. Kill them.",

The question of the study is to compare the different preschool approaches. Even in the control group only one fourth qualified for no public programs such as head start or private preschool. Only a tiny fraction of the intervention group is really could be part of a head start group. Remember these are different public preschool curricula that are being compared. \n\nOf course we expect that the head start group would eventually catch up with all the other programs.

The nurse commented on how \"rare\" this disease is in Oregon. My response to her was \"how can you claim something is rare when no one ever tests for this disease?\" Instead we are diagnosed with various illnesses with no proof or documentation such as Fibromyalgia.  A couple years ago I went to my Dr. because of a tick bite. This Dr. does believe in chronic Lyme and I had no problem getting antibiotics from her for a 3 month period. She contacted the health dept. and they said I needed to be tested first before I could start taking antibiotics! Since it takes 4-6 weeks for the antibodies to form we know the results will be negative. The health dept. admitted this would be the case but they wanted the test anyway! So this obviously provides inaccurate information leading to the myth that Lyme Disease is rare in Oregon!",

In the same year the Australian bishops amended Towards Healing to require mandatory reporting in all cases, irrespective of civil laws. In 2013, the CDF told them that they could have it for everyone else except clergy. What you propose has been tried and it does not work, because Church officials take oaths to obey canon law, and any such protocol is not binding on any bishop without the approval of the Vatican. What the bishops really should do is publicly disagree with Pope Francis over his rejection of mandatory reporting in all cases. If Cardinals can issue a “correction” to a pope over matters of doctrine, then surely, they can do it for canon law.",

France did not act when Hitler broke both provisions. Had they acted promptly, Hitler would have remained a footnote in the history books.\n\n- France and England sat on their hands while Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia and then Poland. Had they attacked promptly in the West while Germany was busy in the East, their odds of success would have been a lot better. Simply letting Hitler schedule each campaign as he pleased was a huge strategic blunder.\n\nWe see the same indecision today, dressed up as \"political correctness\" - not just in France, but in most Western countries.  It is clear by now that \"refugees\" in Germany were involved in the attacks both in Paris and in Brussels. Fools like Mutti Merkel, not \"populism\", enable Wilders and Le Pen.",

Dr. Appleby will have to be declared by a court to be an imminent danger to himself or to others before he will be \"forced\" into our mental health system.....or, declared mentally ill through the court system after committing a crime.  I'm guessing the latter is possible in his case.  \n\nThe issue of coercive treatment for mental health issues is a huge unresolved one.  Unfortunately, many of the truly heinous crimes we see are committed by individuals with recognized but untreated mental illness issues...most frequently schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder and, especially with vets, PTSD.

Forget your 6%, that's just an arbitrary number.   You need to earn 4.6% in an investment that has lower risk than the utility bill savings in order for the investment option to be worthwhile.  Utility bills are paid with after-tax money, and so your investment also needs to be non-tax sheltered as well for an apples to apples. Sure, there's some risk around the Tesla warranty.  But it's relatively small.  Even if Tesla fails it doesn't mean that your roof will fail. \n\nAnother point that I neglected is that the bill savings can be reinvested.  So, let's say I save $2500 on my elec bill during my first year.  This is an extra $2500 that I have and can put into this \"6%\" investment account for 30 years.

From RTD's website ( http://www.rtd-denver.com/factsAndFigures.shtml ) there's 2.92 million people in the district and 329k average weekday boardings.  What's tricky is translating boardings into unique passengers.  The average rider would make at least 2 boardings per day (round trip commute).  Presumably transfers count too, thus someone taking a bus to the train would count for 4 boardings per day.  Some could even have 6, or more.  But I would guess the lion's share are people that make between 2 and 4 boardings per day, so let's say 3 for a reasonable average.  329k / 2.92M / 3 = 3.8%.\n\nI agree that transit is best suited for dense population areas (Manhattan being the most obvious example), and conversely a poor fit for spread-out areas.

Others have mentioned there would be less recourse to first responders as well.  Does anyone really believe government will restructure itself appropriately and accordingly?  I believe at least one public sector union has already spoken out against Basic Income - would their members still be guaranteed a job (for life) if they were no longer needed to poke around someone else's life?

The same names kept popping up in many of the funds. \n\nSo that is when I started buying these companies instead of the funds. I now only have one small holding in a US MF fund. The rest is in quality dividend & dividend growth companies. There is no going back for me. My fees in the equities portion of my portfolio were 0.02% last year, and that is only because I had to invest my dividends and new contributions. \n\nSure, some people may not want to DIY, that is fine.

A portion, up to 50% of the output of a GTL plant can be what is commonly referred to as a diluent.  In other parts of the world a diluent is used to extract heavy oil and in several parts of the Canadian tar sands programs a diluent is used to blend with their heavy crude to transport the heavy oil in pipelines.  We can do the same thing on the North Slope with a diluent to help extract this heavy oil and assist in the transport down TAPS to Valdez.  The diluent is recovered at the refinery and turned into valuable products.  Diluent will have a higher value than the heavy crude oil.  So the natural gas already on the North Slope can be turned into valuable liquids which can be shipped down TAPS to market and it can also be used to create a diluent to help extract and transport this heavy oil.  GTL's weren't available 20 years ago they are today.",

The fact that the teacher spoke of needing plus size shopping pretty much confirms that.\nBUT lastly, it was NOT body shaming to tell her that she needs different clothes, OR that she needs to lose weight. She is a kid, and IS overweight. She is not a 60 y.o.. more importantly, the teacher did not post pix of her and make fun which is really what body shaming is. Now, if she spoke out load so the whole class could hear, she was out of line. But we do not know if that is the case.

Just on shelf-stable goods alone, the markup seemed to be somewhere between 100-600%. I thought if I just owned a barge, I would bring goods to Bethel and undercut the obscene prices. \n\nI realize the cost of ownership and maintenance of such transport vessels is high. I could never afford it. But the City of Bethel? I see barges on the marketplace for <5 Million. Put the transport and maintenance at $10 million total. How long would it take you running shelf stable goods at 500% markup before you'd pay that off, even on high side cost estimates? I wish there was more proactive and altruistic efforts like this in Alaska. Just my silly two cents.",

It is just stupid to say wind costs 60c/kWh and nuclear/coal/gas is 90c/kWh. Anyone who does this does NOT understand the basics of electrical systems.\n\nYes, wind delivers electricity at 60c/kWh, but ONLY WHEN IT IS BLOWING. Ditto for Solar. So what happens to SA on a windless night? This is the question that these \"experts\" never answer. If we were to install only wind & solar, we would have to install a duplicate electricity system powered by gas for windless nights. Even if there was no wind for one hour on one night, this system would have to sit there ready to power the country. And that costs lots of money. and that cost must be added to the 60c/kWh that wind supposedly costs.",

It is followed by the story of mercy where the servant fails to forgive. Disciples were servants of their Master -- those who do not show mercy and forgive are not worthy servants.  Also, do you recall that Jesus dined, not just with tax collectors, but also with Pharisees (Lk 7:36), with whom he disagreed. Jesus did not shun those he disagreed with.

We now spend 35x more on standardized testing than just 7 years ago.  \n\nThe result?  There isn't enough money for science labs, civics, health, PE, music, art, shop, nurses or the counselors needed to advise students on college and career choices.  Further, outside measures like the NAEP haven't budged.  \n\nWe only need a few, high quality standardized tests to compare students, classes and schools.  Meanwhile, multiple studies show unit tests are far more relevant to learning, and grades are the ultimate predictor of college or career success.\n\nOvertesting isn't working and it's not worth it.",

So to flesh out the concerns of Second Amendment people, should supreme court justices resign during the next administration, and judges placed into that court who oppose the Heller decision, it is quite likely that gun control advocates will file suits that will go all the way to the supreme court and the court will reverse itself.

Forty years without resolving the conundra in several important theories is not significant  --  basic research does not operate on a smooth curve, but rather in weird, random stairsteps.  \n\nI also wonder how much the drastic shift from university-sourced funding to corporate-sourced has affected basic research.  Corporations by their very nature do not want theoretical science, they want applied science  --  they want widgets, and they want more and better of what they're already doing.  Hardly any research is being done in the US that does not have direct corporate funding  --  and I worry about the impact of that change.",

However, if one looks instead at the annual growth rate in full-time jobs, it was 2.7% in October 2017, less than July 2011 (2.8%) and not substantially higher than August or September 2011 (2.6%). As for the headline about a new record being set for full-time jobs, that happens all the time with these data; September was a record month too. Shouldn’t the headline have been “Unemployment rate rises in October”?",
