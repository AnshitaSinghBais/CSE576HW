Everyone step back for a moment and think - the fact that the current legal system requires \"proof beyond doubt\" that a stranger raped someone who's  extremely intoxicated IS the problem. The victim was intoxicated and had hired a taxi to be taken home. The victim ended up naked and the taxi driver had sex with her. Evidence showed that. It was plain wrong. NO WOMEN CONSENTS TO SEX WITH A RANDOM STRANGERS. (outside sex trafficking-don't go there) Our criminal justice system is seriously flawed. Many sick, depraved people are out on the street, and dealing with our children, our seniors, and our family members because of it. Let's look at how the system is messing up in the NUMEROUS case like this one...Arguing the woman's drunkenness does not change the fact-some pervert who could drive your daughter to a back alley one day too had sex with this women when he should not have",

But put a time limit on how long you'll give things to improve!\n\nMy very strong hunch, based both on difficult personal experience and from talking to other women who've had similar experiences, is that this guy is not interested in sex. Maybe the intimacy is too scary, maybe he can't perform without having a sense of newness with a partner, maybe he's really a sexless morph who just would rather not get it on very often. \n\nHe's not going to change. \nAnd most often, things will get worse, not better. \nDon't waste too much time with him, and good luck!",

No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.

His real sin is his honesty.  Make no mistake, statutory rape is rape regardless of consent by the victim, because the victim simply is not old enough to consent.  Milo had his first (homo)sexual encounter when he was 13 or 14 with a Catholic priest .  Thirteen or fourteen is too young to have sex -- homosexual or otherwise -- but they're doing it anyway.  Milo's politically unforgivable transgression was to explain that he was a willing participant and to describe the personal importance of the experience.\n\nHis account made me uncomfortable because it forced me to confront realities outside of my personal experience.

They don't nor ever had, otherwise the pill wouldn't have made a difference, if men wanted it more and that's what gave women power over men then they'd still have that power. Somehow they don't. And yet it seems sex wasn't the power they held, weirdly enough we hear a lot about past \"shotgun weddings\", let me tell you something poor women worked, dad was liable to fund them until they married and yet there was were shotgun weddings concentrated.\nAnd yet a lot of wedlock kids happened with kids who still saw their daddies and were directly supported by them but mom wanted nothing with dad. So it seems women were still fucking for the reason they always fucked, fucking itself. Women lined up the docks for the same reasons girls line up the sports block, to see hot men who are there to work not please them sexually.",

Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks.

Such a judgmental statement is in ignorance of how anyone and everyone chooses to marry: it is out of love, and one way that love is expressed is through the intimacy of sexual union.  Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.  We've heard it all before, and it still makes little sense, just like celibacy and creeping infallibility.",

No, this is normative developmental and universal sexual behavior.  And by universal I that means that it is practiced by all human beings at one time or another in their lives.  And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

He's had innumerable girl friends, mistresses and victims. He described his efforts to avoid venereal disease while living a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle as his \"personal Vietnam.\" In that context, he described himself as a \"great and very brave soldier\" -- a manifestation of his contempt for real soldiers. He's a racist and a fascist who mocks the handicapped and attacks women.

While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

The woman in the article stated women should be able to be topless because men can do it. What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said \"object\". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S.",

As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex.

Why did they continue to stay if they realized they entered a room full of only well-dressed black men? Were these victims angry because they gave sex thinking they were going to get glamour or well-paying jobs? Prepare yourselves. He may just get ACQUITTED.",

The United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, at 35 percent (not including any state levies), yet the actual amount in corporate taxes that the government collects (“the effective tax rate”) is lower than those of Germany, Canada, Japan and China, among others. The reason is confusingly called “tax expenditures,” a doublespeak term designed to legitimize special interest tax breaks and loopholes. \nThose ‘expenditures’ will cost the U.S. government $628.6 billion over the next five years, according to a 2010 report from the Tax Foundation.

But in essence they can't because the Bishop of Rome is the purported leader of the universal church. Perhaps PF's desire to be called the Bishop of Rome (as opposed to \"Pope\") was a first step toward hierarchical decentralization, and this would open the door for bishops to guide their respective flocks according to the principles of sensus fidelium. This is all pure speculaltion of course, IMO it is more likely that successive popes will continue to confound matters by insisting that their vision for the church is tantamount to Divine Truth, thereby furthering the RCC down the path of ecclesial irrelevance.

However, Obama/Biden and their advisors were just as clueless about the Middle East as Bush/Cheney---witness the former pair's 2010-11  remarks that a pluralistic Iraq would be their legacy, or Biden's complaints about Sykes-Picot that implicitly presuppose that there were some more \"natural\" cultural/geographic borders that the British/French missed.

People of color (especially Blacks) and poor whites are more likely to get abused by police and even shot even when unarmed and not a threat - not to mention the abuse by the legal system. Every stage is racially skewed. Whites are less likely to live in areas that are heavily police patrolled. And for crime committed in similar rates conviction rates are way out of proportion - so whites not only get arrested less for crimes they do in fact commit - but they are way less likely to be convicted. Sentencing follows a similar pattern - suspended sentence or rehab for whites and prison for blacks. It's a fact. It does stand to reason that most white people (and yes even a few brown folks who are true believers in our system) are going to say absurd things like \"I've never been abused by police - so it must not be problem\" or \"I've never seen racism - so it must not exist.\"",

Unfortunately that wasn't the situation. This year one of them could look much better than the other, both of them could be underwhelming, or both could be great. I prefer Siemian but I see him only making the cut if he is way better. If Lynch is even in performance with Siemian regardless whether it's good, average, or bad, he will become the starter.

However, showing the brutality toward a spiritual practice like Falun Gong has value in that it reminds us all about the ugliness of repression.\nThroughout China's history its society emphasized the importance of values and virtue. That is, until the CCP eroded the decent parts of Chinese society during its occupation of China. This is reality.\nOverall, I find Shen Yun uplifting, entertaining, and visually stunning.\nI see no hidden agenda or political zingers.",

This is an easy and painless cut to help the American taxpayer .Given the unlimited information found online , libraries are no longer needed as well and funding for them should be cut. Every school has a library so public funded one's are no longer needed.  Nearly everyone uses a cell phone so they are connected to all the information they need . Notice how hard it is to find a phone booth anymore---they too are no longer needed. Newspapers are dying out as well because people can get more up to date information elsewhere .

I myself don't care where they set the earnings rate--as long as they move it only .25 at a time.

Governments need revenues to pay for necessary benefits such as public education and health care. These will paid for whether with government taxes (deficits) or private fees. How will the carbon tax work with the existing tax structure? Infrastructure spending needs funds. If we need infrastructure we also need a source of funds to pay for it. These are new expenditures so a new tax would seem to be required. Maybe we don't need new infrastructure, i. e. gridlock forever.\n\nBTW Trump proposes infrastructure spending and without new taxes.

I would hope that a discretionary officer stationed there would be able to distinguish between those who are of an alternative and benevolent bent from the predators, miscreants, and parasites who see a place to live without consequence.  You can't fault people for wanting to live off the grid on a beach paradise.  There is a strong cultural precedent in America to get away from it all.  No one ever wrote John Muir a citation for illegal camping, making a field toilet, or not having a pass. \n\nI wholly support and appreciate the work DLNR does and think we need about twice as many officers as we have statewide, along with a commensurate budget increase.

My view is that Jesus was not drawing a line.  You seem to think there is no other possibility but line-drawing.  I disagree.  Reading Matthew 5 as a whole, it seems clear -- at least to me -- that Jesus was preaching the reign of God, an exhortation to a different way of thinking and being.\n\nI say that notwithstanding Matthew 5:17.  Pious Jews followed all 613 commandments of the Torah.  Jesus taught a priority among these: two of them -- love of God and neighbor -- were \"all the law and the prophets.\"  So I put this question: what commandment do you follow when \"love of God and neighbor\" conflicts with \"let no man put asunder\"?  Isn't this logic \"OTHER than line drawing\"?",

The MidEast countries who supplied the terrorists who murdered Americans, also enjoy free billions from America each year, to continue the policies of colonialism, which invite terrorist attacks. Because the foreign and domestic oil and mining corporations are not done bribing the Washington fatcats to use the country of America as a means to legitimize the invasions and occupations so a few fatcat corporate owners, investors and politicians can make blood money profits off the backs of slaughtered Native owners in the way of profit. Like the Imperial Roman Empire, today America is used by leeches",

At that point the daughter was in no danger of being shot by the assailant outside the home.  The shooter arrived armed. No mention that the guy who got shot was armed while he was outside the house. I'll go with he was. So exactly what lead to the father shooting.  We do not know; others outside the home saw the shooter and the guy who gets shot arguing.  So what actuly occurred or why the shooter shot is unknown at this point.  So pretending you know the dad was right is sheer speculation. My observation is a viable as any other at this point.",

Those who are not seeking God, but who are instead focused on continuing their sin are in deep trouble.

Regulations dictating that a shop can't be any closer to a treatment center than it is to a location where children are seems also silly. Are recovering people no better than children?

Trudeau is increasing regulations and preparing a suite of new personal and corporate taxes and the Americans are doing the exact opposite.

In addition, this story is lacking any quotes or sources other than political. You were able to send a photographer all the way to Alamosa to take pictures of Boutique Air, but you couldn't get one quote from an airline representative or even a passenger? This makes this story look like a press release from the Representative's office, with some fluff thrown in.

And paid for by all without regard to personal views and objections?

Any one of those guns making it on board could have brought down a plane.  He wonders about water---anything over 3 oz. of fluid could be something to be exploded on an airplane. Simply buy your water on the other side of security . TSA isn't to blame for long lines--we are.  We bring too much stuff on board that has to be checked by TSA.  Blame the airlines for that.

The next reasonable admission is that the lands were not owned exclusively by the government but while the government was said to hold the title, the original owners who the lands were taken from by the Kamehameha warriors were in federal law the owners due to be compensated for their taking. This is an issue not yet resolved.

Mr. Fletcher's demand for PSAs on global warming is like Henny Penny pushing PSAs to warn that the sky is falling, or some fringe religious groups demanding PSAs that \"the end [of the world] is near\" and \"Jesus is coming.\"  \n\nA PSA is not \"sponsored\" -- it's paid for as a donation of on-air time by a broadcaster, in the public interest, perhaps to satisfy a requirement imposed by the FCC that a broadcast license requires some on-air time be devoted to public forums and announcements \"pro bono\" (free and for the benefit of the public).  The purpose of a PSA is to inform the public about something important that people are not yet aware of.  For example:  \"Time to get your flu shot.\"  PSAs should not be used for political propaganda.",

Some of these deaths would happen even if the nation had sensible gun laws. Many would not. \n\nThe research that exists increasingly shows there are effective measures that reduce gun deaths without materially infringing on law-abiding people’s liberty: deny firearms to domestic abusers, for example; perform serious background checks on would-be gun buyers; require that gun owners obtain a license. Such measures...would make society safer. \n\n—So, About That ‘Good Guy’ With A Gun \nWashington Post 7/12",

Visiting places I've been countless times; I never tire of having my breath taken away with the views both large and small. Even right here in Anchorage, with five mountain ranges around us, the quality of the light in all its mutations throughout the seasons, and the changes in weather fills me with awe daily. Recently standing at the end of Turnagain Arm and thinking of the hundreds of time I had taken in that view, I was moved to tears at the natural beauty that is my home. Sitting at a red light, almost anywhere in Anchorage, I see people looking completely oblivious to their surroundings. All you have to do is look up-look at the mountains, the clouds, the view!  I know all of the places that the roads rise up and give you a far off view of the Alaska Range, the Aleutians, the Talkeetnas; and of course, the ever present Chugach. Never dull.",

Now we have a skewed-like-crazy distribution of wealth that's worse than what we used to scoff at for banana republics in the 1960s. Isn't it obvious that we should be asking more of the top end? Why should the maximum by only 43% and why do we hit that at less than $1 million and then keep it stable from there?",

Very few women's voices. especially by those who have given birth (especially those who have given birth more than once, or who have had multiple miscarriages or babies with serious problems.) You are all living in a fantasy world. Sexual intercourse by heterosexual married partners (i.e. husband and wife) is for two purposes: 1) to increase marital \"bonding\", and 2) to replace yourselves biologically (i.e. try to have at least 2 children). Some wish to have more than 2 children -- let them go ahead and have those children -- my husband and I did! But for those who do not feel up to birthing and raising 2 or more children, let them use any form of birth control they desire. The important goal is to raise a happy family while keeping your mind, body and spirit alive and well.",

One of these areas is found in \"Gaudium et spes\" [approved on December 7, 1965, by a vote of 2,309 to 75]. which stressed the limited competence of church leaders in the life of the church and in society.  There is a humility in the description of church leadership that leads to a recognition of the need for a greater role for the laity and a shared sense of responsibility for the development of ecclesial and social life [GS 43].  \n\nThe papacies of JP II and Benedict---were marked by revanchist policies where the major reforms of Vatican II---collegiality, subsidiarity, and synodalism were pushed away, rejected, or 'double-talked' out of existence.",

However, his list of possible SCOTUS picks and his selection of Pence as the VP nominee both struck me as affirmations of his words.  Still, yes, I have doubts.  Foreign policy is actually my primary field of expertise and there we clearly disagree.  While Trump's words were often careless and frighten me, I found the record of Clinton and Obama to be woeful.  Clinton supported intervention in Iraq, and was hawkish in both Syria and Libya.  For me the worst option is someone willing to intervene when tensions are high but lacks the commitment to stay and fix the problems when public support wanes.  Thus my fear with HRC, was exactly what we had with WJC, a hawish and violent policy, but no long term commitment to states after intervention.  Will Trump be better?  Here I have serious doubts.  But simply reimposing the Mexico City Doctrine will help much.",

I suspect we may have been on this round about before. \n\nRe your point 1) I think there is wide agreement that the definition of death, even medically, is harder to define that we may think. It appears you are suggesting death means \"brain dead\". However, for most of human history the cessation of breathing or heart failure was considered death. And some distinguish the brain from consciousness. So for you to critique my point, which was to illustrate how difficult that definition is, and to affirm that 'Turnover from atoms/cells is irrelevant' seems a little dogmatic in of itself. I suspect your hair didn't stand up on the back of your neck as Steve Grand suggested it would when you considered his analogy?\n\nRe points 2)-5), you really seem just to be critiquing the traditional SDA position on the state of the dead - not a critique on the nuanced issues I raised. We can debate your points but it somewhat goes beyond the point I was making.",

In the timespan of one generation, elementary schools went from less than 5% to over 75% students with facial features consistent with Chinese ancestry. \n\n3. Those schools were in places (west side Vancouver, Richmond, South Surrey) where houses are most expensive, about two million dollars each.\n\nSo impress us with your insight, Mr. Yellin. Explain to us how items 1 through 3, above, happened.\n\nSee, the reality is that they happened because Canada imported lots of rich folks from Hong Kong and Mainland China, who flooded the market with billions of dollars, skyrocketing prices.
