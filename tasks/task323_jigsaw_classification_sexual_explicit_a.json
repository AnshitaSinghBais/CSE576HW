So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

We conclude that the district court did not err in applying the sixteen-level enhancement because, under the modified categorical approach, Rocha-Alvarado’s prior conviction for attempted sexual abuse in the first degree pursuant to Oregon Revised Statutes § 163.427(1)(a) qualifies as a “crime of violence\".\"\n\nRocha-Alvarado was charged with three counts of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree, alleging that on or between March 24, 2012, and August 29, 2012, he subjected a nine-year-old girl to sexual contact by touching her vagina, breast, and lips.\n\nHe was deported in 2013 and this is his sentence for coming back in after deportation.",

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms.

I've had more than one friend who was sexually assaulted by a brother growing up, and in my extended family, one brother orchestrated a gang rape of his own brother.  Maybe because of my history, in my own family there were lines of privacy around intimate body care that were never disturbed or questioned, so I can imagine being uncomfortable with the situation LW described.",

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

I don't want him or I to die of old age too soon. It's going to be a fascinating trial. What I'm curious about are these questions. Were these women given monetary gifts afterwards? Were they looking forward to an adventure of being \"raped\" by a black man, especially a Hollywood celebrity? But were angry that they fell asleep and missed the fun? Why did they continue to stay if they realized they entered a room full of only well-dressed black men? Were these victims angry because they gave sex thinking they were going to get glamour or well-paying jobs? Prepare yourselves. He may just get ACQUITTED.",

None of them should be touching that building with a 10-foot pole, brokering a deal, etc.  What, Pfeffer and Acre get private audiences with the whole leadership apparatus, and gets to pull the strings?  Was Gottstein or anyone from the public there to voice the public's interest?  Let it go to market.  The free market.  And get out from under the stain and attempt to stand up for some of our public dollars that have been squandered.  This article made me scream out at breakfast this morning, \"Motherf***ers!\"",

Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks.

When I got to her home, she was accompanied by a local Rape Relief representative.  As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.  She never did.",

It is not.  \n\nThe question of having sex in a way that \"avoids pregnancy\", which seems a new one in this thread, is definitely more complicated.  While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

The case involved a father who put peanut butter on his daughter's genitals so that he could derive sexual pleasure from watching the dog lick it off. \n\nHe was convicted of beastiality by a lower court, but this was reversed because the dog was not penetrated.\n\nThe Supreme Court stated in its decision that it was the job of Parliament to rewrite the law.\nDoes anyone know whether they made the changes?",

Such a judgmental statement is in ignorance of how anyone and everyone chooses to marry: it is out of love, and one way that love is expressed is through the intimacy of sexual union.  Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.  We've heard it all before, and it still makes little sense, just like celibacy and creeping infallibility.",

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

The issue is that these nurses were not looking at this man's genitals for medical purposes. They were doing it because they wanted to, to satisfy a personal desire.

Father D. accused me and the other boy of stealing altar wine, which was not true. He told us we had two options: we could be thrown off the altar boys and expelled from school. Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

It wasn't real easy,   I still think the administrators and Board members were a bunch of #@$%$s, but they are $#$%^s \"in the past.\"  I've \"gotten even\" by enjoying the last 30 plus years and, while I've been \"at it\", outliving all of them.\n\n  It sounds like Aaron is doing the same.  \n\nThis will sound a little \"preachy\", but, IMO,  how we handle \"getting screwed\" is more important than \"getting screwed\"  regards and best wishes,   Gary",

To have to admit that the sign is necessary truly saddens me. \n\nTrump represents an historical coarsening of America and, from other reports and what I see on social media, he has emboldened the worst among us to act out their Un-American ideals.

There is general agreement that Honolulu need elected officials independent from special interests.  I learned quickly that an ordinary citizen, like myself, could not get heard--the media and organizations that held debates and forums informed me that only candidates who had previously held office would be permitted to participate.  We cannot expect campaign reform to originate from our elected officials.  So how do we begin to create a level playing field?  Thank you Ian for your insightful article.

It would appear that journalists are as fond of conspiracy theories as any of the fantasy prone out there in the wilds of cyberspace. There are actual conspiracies. Yet, making unsubstantiated allegations is not proof. The purpose of rumours is to sow doubt. Even if nothing ever comes of this, and it probably won't, at least some people will always wonder if Trump and his colleagues are in league with the Russians to undermine Western democracy.

Our courts have been that way now for decades.\n\nAnd so in our post-1980's nation, the judges in the present 2017 case will be doing precisely what I stated: They will judge whether the law over-reaches and violates a fundamental right in the Charter.",

The US Bishops' pastoral letter responding to HV, 'Human Life in Our Day', was a moderate affirmation both of the teaching of HV and of the conscience rights of married couples. There were many priests who wrestled with HV as confessors, and many bishops who tried conscientiously to help them do it. I knew one very conservative priest who left ministry because he thought HV was wrong, but he could see no wiggle room for himself as a confessor. Many people remember or know about Cardinal O'Boyle's confrontation with the Catholic University theologians. I don't think O'Boyle was representative of the US hierarchy.

Another example using local entities: Hon-BOWS on going sewage/potable water upgrades. Huge undertakings, but not quite as large as the rail. Why aren't we seeing major failures? How about because there is a functional mature entity already in place. I'm sure Hon-BOWS has it's issues, but it really helps to have a mature entity doing projects.",

The fact is that other countries have health care and education and they haven't needed to suppress the population to get it. Trudeau made a  mistake it wasn't the first and it won't be the last.

What Berkowitz wants the money for is there has been a modernization program that started over a decade ago with design and partial federal and state funding. It was designed with a then cutting edge sheet pile dock design that has since failed miserably. BTW this has nothing to do with the crusie ship docking.  The whole thing is hundreds of million of dollars over budget and years behind schedule, with dried up state funding and the feds starting to question where all the  money went with not much to show  for it.  So that is what the road money would go towards-- fixing a grossly mis managed project that many people question was ever needed with other priorities and a stagnant economy. With no state help we anchorage tax payers are going to be fleeced for this for decades.",

If the midwife screwed up and killed or otherwise harmed the baby, why have we not heard of it? Raising the cost of midwives to $4,700 per to maintain a license while others in similar profession pay only $165.00 is very suspect and boarders on the criminal.

I can bet you that you can ban foreign sales or any other measure and we won't solve these issues unless the supply goes up far, far past the current demand. \n\nOr we could have an economic downturn like the 80's or the 90's and prices adjust downwards because of the lower demand.

The Iraq War began in March of 2003 and he was not a senator until January of 2005.\n\n2/ Bush went against conventional wisdom to put in place a surge strategy in 2005/6 putting  more troops in combat and deployed more effectively.  As a result, the course of the Iraq stabilization and democratization program went from a failure to a fragile success.  \n\n3/ Over 60 years after the Korean War, the US still maintains about 28000 troops in South Korea.  Obviously, the much more unstable nation of Iraq would require US troops for years to come.  Obama negligently pulled them out, reversing the progress won and creating a vacume filled by ISIS.

Early Denver leaders built a rail line to Cheyenne to connect to the Trans-Continental line, or Denver becomes irrelevant.

I don't believe that impacting cognition and brain development during a crucial growth period is worth forcing kids to wake up early.  It doesn't teach them perseverance, it just makes them tired.  Imagine how much more driven they could be if they could think.  Teenagers are in a different growth phase than adults, so it is false to equate them vs an adult waking up early.  Kids getting themselves to school on time is what teaches them responsibility,  not forcing them to do it at zero dark thirty for no reason, particularly when it is obviously bad for theiron development.",

This set into motion what Paul VI himself called the auto-demolition of the Church, which created fissures through which \"the smoke of Satan entered the Temple of God.\" (Paul VI).\n\nPaul VI was also an active homosexual whose intellect was darkened and heart hardened by his intrinsically disordered acts.  Not only did his homosexuality make him susceptible to blackmail to the Church's enemies including the Freemasons (cremation issue) and the Communists (Casaroli Ostpolitik), but he allowed the progressives to hijack the original Vatican II agenda, which was orthodox, replace it with a more liberal agenda, which they tried to implement on a free for all basis until JPII and Benedict.",

We have Freedom of Expression Guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. NO you do not and why not? Well...\n\nTrudeau senior was very cagey when he crafted that Charter. Sure section 2(b) of the Charter says \"Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression...\" but the old curmudgeon stuck in a clause that could take it away. That's right, the infamous weasel clause or section 1. Believe me the Americans never would have stood for that but we had that bamboozled right by us.  Section 1 lets the courts take your freedoms away and as long as the 9 Santa Suites in Ottawa says it is for the good of a free & democratic society \"POOF\" your rights disappear.

The dirt on the Clintons was NOT true, at least those you listed. Hillary had virtually no connection to the uranium deal; she was uninvolved in it. She did not \"lie\" about Benghazi.

They view the whole \"independent contractor\" thing as a liability / tax dodge and effectively treat their drivers as employees\n\nAs for the state, this exemption passed into law in 1993. While the taxi business did lobby for it, I know many folks who served in or worked for the legislature at the time.

But I would not let anyone from the White House appear on another Laura Ingraham television show.\n\nI think Kelly was offering a view from the \"states rights\" old-school of conservative thought.  When you randomly meander down that thinking when talking about the Civil War, undisciplined thinking could lead in that direction.  Then General Kelly is looking to try to find compromise among very strong opinions, especially about the Confederate statues.  So I think he stepped in it, but I don't think he intentionally wanted to go there as a primary driver.  I am sure if he was working with a more organized interviewer, they would have pointed out I am going to ask you about Civil War, etc., to give heads-up on thinking about what you are going to say, etc.  But this seems just too disorganized in the way it was handled.  Then Kelly painted himself in a corner.  Not good. The Trump White House needs to maintain discipline and guard with all news media",

Sure, they make mistakes like all company do especially when trying to come up with the next big thing at the expense of hefty competitors. Will they succeed? Will this be nothing more that a money pit in the end? Maybe, but not for a lack of trying and not before having achieved the status of a world class manufacturing concern.

This included bishops (episkopoi, “overseers”), priests (presbuteroi, “elders”) & deacons (diakonoi, “servants) By the mid 2nd century, the basic NT Canon had been established, as noted in the Muratorian Canon (~160 AD).\n\nSo within about 70 years after the Resurrection, there was an organization communicating across the Mediterranean.

Similarly, reel in the provincial property tax deferral program (empty nesters sitting on a house worth millions don't need a coddling property tax policy). Also, scrap the first time buyer home owner down payment loan program, a ridiculous market interference that only serves to push prices up further (and was derided by the CMHC).\n\nOn a bigger level, I like Josh Gordon's plan for a progressive higher property tax with income offsets.

Unfortunately, this transition demonstrated how far the economy has shifted during the Obama years. The only choices most folks have are debt slavery, wage slavery or joining the black market. Educational or entreprenuership opportunities without a commitment to debt or wage slavery have all but vanished. Small business as we've traditionally known it continues to evaporate. The University of Alaska's business programs are heavily weighted towards training people to work for someone else. Vince's past comments on this site are usually a thinly-veiled commercial for the \"work union, live better\" meme.

Further, many might opt out of such benefits programs in the future, thus transferring many of these costs, particularly for drug benefits, to already stretched provincial health budgets.

A corrupted history-like our churches- is a pathetic source to try and decide current ordination practices.  \n\nI strongly disagree with supporting any form of gender segregation. ATF we need to put the pressure on our priests in church, during church gatherings, and mtgs., bring up the subject so everyone starts talking more and the priests start complaining how much more uncomfortable this discrimination is becoming for them, in dealing with their parish members.

Or maybe the threats she made to Juanita Broadderick? Or claiming that a 12 year old rape victim was really a sex-crazed maniac who sought out her rapist? Trump was calling out the misbehavior and indecency of two specific women who DID seek him out to cause trouble. Hillary engages in this behavior on her time off.

Should society be able to prevent such a choice, or to keep someone alive who prefers to die? Should society be able to require the killing of criminals or even of merely unproductive or inconvenient people? Should society, or individual people, have any right to make decisions about life and death; or should such decisions be left in the hands of God? There is a spectrum of stages of human life, from before conception to after death; and the larger moral issues reverberate in different ways at different stages.  It might be that all beings (e.g. animals) have fundamental rights in proportion to their level of sentience.",

Indeed, I suggest that those governments are _also_ to blame for this - they didn't change the law, they just ignored it.  By their inaction, they told people like this that is was OK to jump the border - to ignore the law, but they never changed the law to make it legal.

She took a 'private' call and broadcast it to the world, thinking it would embarrass the President. In that cowboy hat and garish flower..... the only one she embarrasses is herself.",

Never having served, he made a decision based on \"how it feels\", not \"is it good for the services\".  The Marine Corps Commandant asked for an exemption.  Mr Obama took it personally.  \"Resistance is futile.  All will be assimilated\" comes to mind.  Laugh if you want, but he did it to force \"the collective\" to adhere to his leftist values.  Whether we wanted it or not.  Whether it was good for the country or not.  Now our country finds itself fighting itself.  I think because Mr Obama felt that the U.S.A. should be taken down a notch.  That we shouldn't be leading.  He had an agenda that was counter to basic \"American\" values.  So instead of fixing something that was broke, he tried to break something that didn't need fixing.  \"Inclusive\"?  Why not include the service members who opposed?  Because it wasn't about civil rights.  It was about power.",

It has embassies and consulates all over the world to support travel, a nation that has fostered good relations and Alliances with other nations in the UN, NATO, NORAD and free trade agreements to facilitate the export of Albertan goods NAFTA, CETA and others. Albertan's are also protected by the Canadian Forces, RCMP and Search and Rescue services. Many Albertan's are also employed by the Canadian Government, notably on military bases like Cold Lake. Canadian tourists help your economy and Canadian branch offices employ Albertan's too. Albertan's also benefit from EI, Healthcare, the CCB and a host of other Canadian programs and Canadian infrastructure. This is just a start.

Catholic liturgy has always taken into account the fact that we humans have bodies with which to apprehend and respond to the world around us. That being the case, at various points in the mass we're required to sit, stand, or kneel, depending on the liturgical action. Sitting is the most passive posture of the three and the one that demands the least from us. Kneeling denotes humility and so is appropriate for those points in the mass in which our corporate prayer is the most intense, as in the eucharistic prayer. But in standing our bodies are the most alive - we're free to move, stretch, our blood is flowing more and oxygen is getting to the brain faster - all of which engages us more deeply with the liturgical action. When sitting it is easier to get lulled into a sense of complacency. These days it seems to spur distracted people to look at their cell phones, so there's something to be said for more standing, I think.",

You honestly don't think that the people who do this non-profit work only care about money? If the did they would not be here they would be somewhere they can make money. You want help but so do 100s of others and there is one or two people trying to help them all with nothing to offer. You act like they have endless amounts of money and only pay their employees with it.  The same people keep trying to help even though they know there is nothing out there they keep doing it day in and day out for next to nothing in pay. I looked. A case worker at peninsula mental health makes 35K a year. And you wonder why they don't have enough? Would you work your butt off for people who don't appreciate it and complain about not doing enough when they do all they can with what they have. Want more?

In the US they now sell Combo (or Hybrid) Life or Annuity policies which are combined with a LTCi rider which either allows the insured to access the Death Benefit ahead of time (what the US calls an Accelerated Death Benefit Rider) or allows their monthly Annuity payments to double or triple when a LTC conditon is trggered ! Neither Combo product is that more expensive and the policyholder doesn't lose out if they don't go into a Nursing Home. It's time CALU looks across the border and imports these new Innovative products while NAFTA still exits. Not everything the US does is BAD !",
