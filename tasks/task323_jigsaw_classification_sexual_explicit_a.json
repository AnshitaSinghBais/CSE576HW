Let's fix our own internal problems first for our Rightful Citizens then maybe look at that. Japan isn't taking any refugees for the simple answer of caring for its own CITIZENS first. These folks will bring harm to the US just like they have in other countries along with protests & property damages. They aren't civil.",

And yes, it's exactly these blurry lines that become problematic.\n\nWhen I was quite young (I may even have been a minor) I had a boss who got sexual with me when we were alone in a room. I rebuffed him, and he was a gentleman about it. I was really annoyed, but I continued to work at that job for a while. Was it an abuse of power? Yes. Was it a crime? Actually, legally it may have been. But I don't think of it as a crime. Women used to experience this kind of stuff all the time. I'd like to think the culture has changed a bit since then.\n\nUnfortunately, as you may remember, I have also been a rape victim.

The woman obviously had to be skeeved out, and has her person violated in a clear way, but I doubt even she would rank it a 10?",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

The weapons charge was due to a hand gun that was still on the seat of his car after he had been target shooting, that had inadvertently had a coat pushed onto it. The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

If that's the point you're trying to make, him taking her into the men's room and a transgendered person using the women's restroom are two totally different scenarios. A male who identifies as female isn't going to have his penis on display in the female bathroom, because the stalls are all behind closed doors, so only a pervert who's peeking under or over stalls is going to know that the female in the next stall was actually born a male. If it's not, an unintended consequence of the ordinance would be that it would be difficult for him to take her out alone because it will prohibit her from entering the men's room because she doesn't identify as male.",

BTW:  There are a host of women who have \"documented\" his sexually assaultive behavior.  \n\nI respect President Carter......a truly decent and honorable man.  I have little respect for Clinton, who showed us he had no decency regarding truth and faithfulness to his wife and family.  My disdain for Trump goes far beyone that.  He's shown throughout his life that he cares nothing about others and acts only for his own self-interest, often to the direct detriment of others.  Gary Crum",

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to. Yet women are encouraged to be 'adult' by becoming sexualized - by having sex. How great is that? Ask, who benefits, and how.",

NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks.

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy.

I've had more than one friend who was sexually assaulted by a brother growing up, and in my extended family, one brother orchestrated a gang rape of his own brother.  Maybe because of my history, in my own family there were lines of privacy around intimate body care that were never disturbed or questioned, so I can imagine being uncomfortable with the situation LW described.",

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

So, you think we should encourage one act (prostitution) to discourage another act (sexual assault) on the sexual appetite. Let's apply that idea. You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites. Sorry, but I believe it's not unreasonable to expect people to control their sexual urges. It's not okay to commit sexual assault and it's not okay to visit a prostitute.",

And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

All three have recanted or changed their stories at least once. Broaddrick and Willey testified, under oath, that Clinton never made unwanted advances. Witnesses, including Jones' own sister and BIL and six close friends of Willey's, stated that Willey and Jones had described their encounters with Clinton as consensual. Jones was exposed as a liar for saying Clinton's penis had a deformity, and Willey lied under oath repeatedly to Ken Starr's investigators.

I read your first comment, for example, to be saying that having sex with a woman who is naturally not able to conceive (e.g. after menopause) would be considered a sin.  It is not.  \n\nThe question of having sex in a way that \"avoids pregnancy\", which seems a new one in this thread, is definitely more complicated.  While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent. Love people, use things, not the other way around.",

These ideas, promulgated by heretics and paganss, were taken up by Christian ascetics who also distrusted pleasure. Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture. It is a wholly man-made concept, stemming from the thought that sex is nasty.\n\nRD trots out the standard traditionalist twaddle in support of this.",

While their allegations about violations of the law have to do with the proposed re-structuring of the organization, and the resignation of the long time and well regarded director, this development confirms the belief that the same people have, contrary to law, had secret meetings and have made secret decisions about timber harvest on Deer Mountain and in Petersburg.",

Certainly there are other issues as well, the March budget, the re-opening of NAFTA, defence, carbon taxes, military missions, peacekeeping missions to Africa, are just a few things on the Liberal plate at the moment.

Even though the number one cause of death due to unlawful behavior locally is scofflaw driving, too many cops think it is beneath them to do enforcement. You should have heard the comments at the memorial for Officer Kilcullen regarding his decision to remain in traffic enforcement (a now all but defunct unit at EPD). It's just not sexy work and has the added downer of each and every public contact being unpleasant.\n\nRegarding the unpleasantness: It's really a shame that people don't realize that a cop who pulls you over may well be saving your life by educating you (the citation is the tuition). Too many motorists have habits that can easily be fatal. If I ever get pulled over I will most assuredly thank the officer for helping to improve my driving, little though I choose to drive.",

Additionally, I would like to second what several others have observed: UAS' program is the best in the state and it's something that the school prides itself on. Does anyone really think UAF makes education a priority? If so, please explain, because the folks in natural sciences and engineering would likely find it amusing. Finally, most of the education programs and classes in Alaska are available through distance delivery, so moving the administration to Juneau would not increase class sizes or housing.",

The minister and SASSA must tell SAPO in which areas they doubt their capacities and what evidence is required to allay their doubts - she can't just rush to issue tenders on the assumption that SAPO does not have sufficient capacity. I sense that this resistance to hand over everything to SAPO has more to do with the lucrative tender patronage system that th minister seem to want to preserve as much of as possible in the payment of social grants \n What happened to Radical Transformation and the Developmental State when ministers fight so hard to outsource government functions to expensive private providers?",

But, when people confuse myth and fact, the danger arises that those with one set of beliefs tend to think that those who do not share their belief system are deliberately obtuse and evil. We can engage in reasonable discussion about which religious myths help us to get along better and live more meaningful lives. And we can engage in discourse about what the world is really like by using the scientific method (that never discovers truth but is great at stopping ourselves from fooling ourselves). But when we assert as facts things that cannot be disproven (e.g.- Jesus literally rose from the dead), the only ways to settle the argument are to walk away or bash heads.    Our other problems (economic, political ) cause us to bash heads when belief systems differ.",

This is apparent in their recent denunciation of the fifty year agreement on Hong Kong, in this latest move to block outside cyberspace traffic, and in aggressive militancy in the South China Sea and across Asia generally.\n\nHow curious that a few nations may pick this as a time to buy into the Chinese eyewash about being good citizens of the world and in one case even fast track the process of setting up free trade negotiations with China.\n\nMeanwhile, other countries not as naive and gullible such as the US, Germany and Australia are taking a hard and critical look at their one sided trade and investment relations with China and will force fairness changes.",

Certainly through the Incarnation God is close to us, and moreso, in a sense, when we receive His Body and Blood.  I think rather than mystery/otherness as something to be sought, many EF folks seek transcendance - - a sense of the holy and sacred which the quiet and contemplation of the EF fosters better for some people.   Another poster in the thread spoke of the Mass as feeling like a supper club (I know this is not your position), and for many, I think, it lacks a sense of the reverence appropriate to the Divine and to our Savior.  As in many Catholic things, it's both/and  God with us in the Incarnation and the Body and Blood, yet still retaining all of His Divine attributes wherein He is the creator and we are the creatures.  \n\nDoes that make sense?",

The only failure in using the term \"settled\" is that it implies \"over and done\", and nothing in science is that.\n\nYou appear to be conflating \"predicting the future\" (modeling?) and AGW theory.

The courts should convict more often.\n2. The crown should lay charges more often.\n3.  The police should refer cases to the crown more often.\nThey give no reason why any of these things should happen other than that women are making X complaints and only getting Y convictions. \nIn fact they complain that only 1 in 10 offenders is convicted - the only way you can get \"9 out of 10 offenders getting off \" is if every complaint should result in a conviction.\nIn other words just what RKJ said - they are asking for more convictions based on nothing more than that a woman complained.",

Since Sheriff Trapp says it requires 5.2 FTE to assure 24/7 coverage (allowing for shift overlap, vacations, training, sick leave, other time away from patrol) Veneta actually has a little less than 24 hour coverage from one deputy seven days a week. That is roughly the same standard that is available in the county. However where I live, we have  three deputies providing coverage for the entire county (as observers noted about the size of Connecticut). Under the district proposal, my service would have increased substantially; the service in Veneta would have probably decreased, since the deputy on duty would have had a larger area to cover.",

My teenage daughter spent the night at a friend's house and I had to retrieve her from police custody at Service High School at 2:00 a.m.  All the kids were cited and the fine was substantial.  She had just opened her first checking account with a balance of over $600 of hard earned babysitting money.  We drove downtown and she wrote her first check ($250) to pay her fine.  The other kids' parents chose to get their kids off the hook. To this day, it feels like a knife to my heart when I think about my decision to choose tough love, but my daughter is so much the better for that experience.  She ended up graduating both high school and nursing school with honors, made the dean's list in college and she is a responsible and loved wife and mother today, with 3 children of her own.

The excess carbon early coal-burning steam engines put in the air is still there.  Each year adds a new (and larger) increment--it's like filling a bathtub, not running a shower.  Earth temperatures in recent decades have risen correspondingly.  No plausible source for these short-term increases in carbon and heat, other than human greenhouse-gas producing activity, exists--at least, in the opinion of the vast majority of climate and earth scientists.

How - changes. My answer may have no application to anyone else. Merton said this well... he said \"I go where God looks for me\". It is a discernment of the heart and an abandonment to the present moment. When the Iraq war was on the brink, thousands took to the streets - I took to a monastery chapel, before the Blessed Sacrament, a day long bread and water fast in prayer and silent solidarity. Some marched Some kept vigil. When I post, I hope to include some 'actionable' item for the person reading it to discern if it is theirs to act on. Action, is the understanding dimension of Contemplation. Steindle-Rast in The Way of Silence just out, does a brilliant discourse on this... there that was the actionable item. Slow read! My now is about a grace sustained dailyness.  Yours? go where God looks for you.",

The situation is unlikely to have been helped by the president’s own words and allegations made against him.

That was preceded by a revealing testimony at an ongoing senate inquiry last month, where a self-confessed assassin testified that Duterte, in his previous incarnation as the longtime mayor of the city of Davao, had ordered the killing of criminals and his opponents – and in one case even personally “finished off” an employee from the justice department with a sub-machine gun...\" \nSo you're pro murder.

Simple reasons are 1- they are a thousand pounds lighter; 2- rolling impact is less than stepping; 3- bikers don't graze; and 4- bikes don't leave urine and poop on the trails.\n\nMain reasons for mountain bike damage are unauthorized trails, so if you allow them to build in designated zones, there should be no need for additional trail building; and skidding, which again is mitigated by proper trail design.\n\nLord Hill is large enough to share, you can have your peaceful walks and we can bike 500 feet away, and you'll never know we are there or step in our shit.",

I'm not discounting the use of a shotgun or other firearm to protect against a bear attack but I'm saying that if you're not comfortable and proficient using a shotgun it would be extremely dangerous to be carrying and also be ineffective against a bear attack. Bear spray has been overwhelmingly proven to prevent bear attacks, does it work 100percent of the time? No. Neither does a shotgun. This isn't about taking away guns or anything else.  The statistics of the efficacy of bear spray are very convincing and to make fun of people who choose to use it is bullying. This isn't a macho pissing contest.",

When using web browsers, the best practice is to disable all client-side scripting (which does exactly this) by default, and only allow specific instances on a case-by-case basis. This includes Java, Javascript (which as you point out is less dangerous than Java), VBScript, JScript, and others. This stuff can get a bit tricky for the layman, though. My general recommendation is to run a combo such as Firefox with the NoScript plugin.\n\nA good firewall is essential, yes, and IE is not the security disaster that is used to be -- but no browser should be considered \"secure\".\n\nAll that said, in my experience few ordinary users are willing to put up with the inconvenience of actually having good security.

Now that that rubicon has been crossed without any apparent repercussion, there is no limit to the amount of depravity Trump can indulge without suffering penalty. No, Trump's base means everything to him. Without them he is nothing.",

The tax level in Norway has fluctuated between 40 and 45% of GDP since the 1970s.[6]\n\nThe relatively high tax level is a result of the large Norwegian welfare state. Most of the tax revenue is spent on public services such as health services, the operation of hospitals, education and transportation.[7]\n\nRevenue levels are also influenced by the important role played by oil and gas extraction in the Norwegian economy.\n\n\"The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples' money.\" Margaret Thatcher",

They refused to provide any guideline for what day trading is by their definition, what the limits are in terms of market activity and where I crossed their invisible line.

Without it, Quebec would probably have left the federation.

I'm a bit surprised that there appears to be only one route going to the University now - if any young people were going to use the bus system, it would be students. I have never had an issue with the frequency of the buses - the 13 route is once an hour (I think an extra one comes around between 8 and 9am). I don't really see how this system is better if it potentially involves more walking, especially in a cold-climate city like Anchorage.

The \"regulators\" work with them to make sure each corporation feels good about getting a mere 27% price increase.  I think we have a difference of opinion about what a \"regulator\" is.  I don't think there was anyone at the table representing the people.  You can point to the ACA until you turn to stone, but it does not change that fact.

Shelton, reputed Klansman.      \n\nWhat we do know is back in the 1800s the Guard was horribly racist while Harrison Kincaid's Oregon State Journal was far more progressive.

Except, on Bagram Macedonians and Bosniaks with a few Afghans did the work the soldiers could have done. What did happen was that about 1 out of every 60 went downrange to work on Combat Outposts(COP). The rest stayed on Bagram, worked out at the gym, went shopping and hit salsa night at the MWR. Reality was that only about 2 companies of the brigade needed to be there. But colonels don't get promoted for staying at home, so everybody went. There's a few thousand of the troops right there.

Prior to the 1973 worldwide restriction on commerical polar bear hunting, that number was dramatically lower, so low that a meeting of polar bear specialists in 1965 concluded that extinction was a real possibility. Some reports even estimated the number of bears as low as 5,000 worldwide. Yet by 1990, Ian Stirling — at the time, the senior research scientist for the Canadian Wildlife Service and a professor of zoology at the University of Alberta; basically, one of the most respected polar bear scientists on the planet — felt comfortable answering the question as to whether polar bears are an endangered species by stating flatly: “They are not.” He went on to say that “the world population of polar bears is certainly greater than 20,000 and could be as high as 40,000\"\nsee:canadiangeographic.ca/article/truth-about-polar-bears",

This is unfortunate; that movement has generally been a positive force throughout modern history and could have an important role today. \n\nSecond, there are the subtle and not-so-subtle aspersions directed at the heretics (described as railing, shouting, and phone-slamming demi-mondes). The author also praises the professor who posits that \"physical and psychological self-assertion works...\" yet quibbles with Paglia over similar views.

You fail to see that affirmative action for blacks is nothing more that a response to the abuse perpetrated on an entire segment of Americans over most of 2 centuries.  It was a decent, but far from perfect way to provide opportunity quickly to blacks citizens.

He said no, Sir Frank Williams calls the team management in at the start of every season and tells them what his team will not do. It doesn't matter if others do it and prosper, the Williams team does not do these things.\n\nThat's leadership. \n\nToo often these days - in business and in politics - leadership is reactive.

Both forms are crucial to achieve longevity.

Vitamin B12 deficiency (particularly adenosylcobalamin) is a major issue worldwide, especially for vegetarians and vegans.\n\nShe probably had a very good basic metabolism (based on genetics) and a source of very nutritious eggs from a farm or someone who raised chickens on a varied diet.",

We cannot prevail to restructure it on a partisan basis.  To fix health care and provide good universal coverage, we, all Americans, regardless of party must undertake a very difficult task of controlling a massively powerful special interest.  We need either single payer with strong cost control, or nationalized medicine.  We can achieve these objectives only if all of us Americans regardless of party join together to make it happen.

His conclusion: \"The simple fact is, if you're eating cheap shrimp today, it almost certainly comes from a turbid, pesticide- and antibiotic-filled, virus-laden pond in the tropical climes of one of the world's poorest nations...\"  A recent study in Thailand by Swedish-based scientists found that 77 percent of bacteria in farmed shrimp were resistant to one or more antibiotics.",

That's why we are Catholic. We see the limitations of the past, and why we need to grow. \n\nFor others, the Spirit guarantees that whatever was said and decreed in the past is 'the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth'. If it was said, it cannot be changed. And that is why they remain Catholic, secure that they have 'the fullness of truth' guaranteed by the gift of the Holy Spirit to protect the Apostles and their Episcopal successors forever. Amen.

Most if not all of these particular refugees have little to NO viable skills or education to contribute to the pot during a time when opportunities are already diminishing  for our own... This time is very-very  different than in the past.  With the harsh down-turn in our economy, the probability of these particular refugees contributing to the economy and paying their share is extremely LOW.  The probability of becoming permanent leaches off our already depleted resources is HIGH !

At the very least, eliminate ALL tax credits for political donations.     These credits force every Canadian to support every donation (up to 75% of the donation).\n\nSome formula of fixed subsidy and per vote subsidy would be far better.   And issue each candidate a wooden soapbox and a megaphone.\n\nOf course, that would still leave the problem of block votes for access, which is used by groups led by McVety, etc.",
