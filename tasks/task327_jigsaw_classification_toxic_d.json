Don't think killing him didn't cross my whole families mind. Screw them stop keeping them in jail and use that money to help the innocent children that are being hurt.

It is convenient to blame the unions but you set yourself up for the \"smoke and mirrors\" when you point your finger at a straw man.\n\nThat being said, yes there should be metrics; and since the numbers don't look good there needs to be an effort to bring them back in line. I applaud Civil Beat's Law Center for the Public Interest for their work and I hope that the OIP can work with them to bring greater transparency to state and local government.

If the U.S. is stupid enough to impose a border tax on Canadian exports, there will be some damage to Canada (and also to U.S. consumers), but Canada is definitely not going to impose a similar tax on imports from the United States. That would be paid for entirely by Canadian consumers. Want to see the cost of living in Canada, shoot skyward with big boosts on the cost of everything from imported fruits and veggies to auto parts?\n\nSo, Canadians don't like the idea of a Trump tax.

Fairbanks has traffic, people use studded tires, and yet we don't have ruts. Why?\n\nWell, the obvious reason is that our roads are frozen 5-6 months out of the year -- literally asphalt ice. Which is why we need studs ... although you can make due with aggressive tread mud-and-snow (MS) tires. I don't recommend Bilzzaks because they degrade on summer roads, so you either need a new set every winter or a summer and winter set. Blizzaks are also MUCH more expensive than studded tires (although they won't be under Giessel's plan).\n\nSo, I'm okay with Anchorage/Juneau being told they can't use studs, but I oppose the entire state being charged extra because studs cause ruts south of the Alaska Range. It's not a problem here in Fairbanks and probably nowhere else north of the Range. A one-size-fits-all \"solution\" is no solution at all.",

Bringing these practices in from the shadows, however, strikes me as entirely sensible.

Such practices will not be eradicated completely but, with the benefit of transparency provided by legalisation, can be reduced, monitored and controlled to a greater extent than they currently are. It is possible to be ambivalent and question some of the thinking behind the government's legalisation initiative yet still support the policy. There is much to criticise here but it seems to me that is true about most of this government's tenuous grasp when it comes to implementing complex policy.

The Superferries, on the other hand, would have been an interesting alternative as they are much faster and could carry vehicles.  Ironically, we are paying $10 billion for rail which will take longer in total travel time than any previous transit system implemented.  When my Tesla 3 arrives later this year, I am driving in with the auto-drive feature and parking free in downtown.   My Leaf does not have the range for a comfortable daily commute.  BTW, today's morning commute via Mililani Express took 41 minutes.

There is absolutely no calculation involving demand for labor that goes into calculating the statutory price floor. Democrats hold a drum circle and decide how much they think people should make and then set out to make it so. Unfortunately, the real world isn't quite as simple as the mind of your average Oregon Democrat. Employers will adapt to the higher cost by moving, investing in automation, or any number of other ways. As the cost of automation decreases while labor costs increase, the economics of automating more and more jobs will move in a predictable direction. The real solution to low wages is for Oregon Democrats to stop persecuting the industries that pay living wages and scaring them away from our state. Let us not forget, Kate Brown took a $100,000 donation in return for prioritizing this bill. That's commonly known as public corruption.",

That's unfortunately why prices here are so expensive.  Everything has to get shipped to the U.S. Mainland first and then it can be shipped to Hawaii, but only using U.S. Flagged vessels which requires the unloading of goods from the foreign ships and reloaded onto a U.S. Flagged ship (e.g. Matson) and then subsequently shipped here.  The Jones Act exists to protect U.S. shipping companies from foreign competition and to ensure that adequate supply ships exist in times of war.  If U.S. shipping companies had to compete with foreign ones, there would be no U.S. shipping companies because the foreign ones are significantly cheaper since they don't have to pay their crews much.",

He is simply a savage who can read and write.

The story is part of a set of materials that also includes an explanation of the science of climate change in language that children can understand, telling the stories of the climate refugees that appear in the story, and how all their lives are interconnected.  In addition, an action plan outlines simple and positive steps every person can take to make a real difference and to become the heroes of their own stories.

Until price fixing is criminalised and those involved are forced to do jail time, this situation will persist.

These people have no shame, no game, they are truly members of a cult that believes they are more privileged. They along with slick Willy Walker at the helm will go down in history as the worst of the worst of what this state ever had in politics. No\nGravel in their guts, no brains, chickenshit losers all of em. SBR GONE! CBR ALMOST GONE! Earnings reserve here they come. Thieves all of them..",

This rapid growth spurred the opening of the state’s newest correctional facility–Goose Creek Correctional Center–in 2012, costing the state $240 million in construction funds. On July 1, 2014, Alaska’s correctional facilities housed 5,267 inmates, and the Department of Corrections (“DOC”) had a fiscal year operating budget of $327 million. Absent reform, these trends are projected to continue: Alaska will need to house an additional 1,416 inmates by 2024, surpassing the state’s current prison bed capacity by 2017. This growth is estimated to cost the state at least $169 million in new corrections spending over the next 10 years.

And if these wages go up, wage pressure, the fed will see this as inflationary and increase interests rates, further increasing costs for the working poor...the system is broken.

Comey released derogatory information on her handling of classified information and made what the FBI called a closing argument against Hillary without a trial. The memo soundly criticizes Comey's letter to Congress just before the election as a serious break of FBI policy. The Assistant AG citing FBI Policy and the FBI rules going back to several past Attorney Generals, including a comment from Eric Holder-- Obama's AG--on Comey's violation policy by delivering the letter just before the election.

His argument is that this would accurately reflect the political sentiment of Canadians is absolute bunk.  PR is a fall back to weather a political backlash of the Canadian voter. His Party has never come close to achieving victory at the federal level- a crystal clear message to Broadbent and his like- minded they have to make the change, not the electoral system.\nBroadbent parrots a leftist perspective that the only legitimate election result is a left-liberal outcome. This is reflective in his demeaning of the November election in the U.S..  In this election, the  Democrats rested on their polls and favourable news clippings.  With that assurance, registered Democrats did not  show up to vote.  They lost the election because of this.  Their stupidity, arrogance, and assumptions were not rewarded.\nDemocracy holds political governance accountable!",

He added, “it’s even on [television] (TV) now”. \n\nThe highest bidder wins in the world of Bob Lynn.   And then Chair Lynn sat on the bill for an entire year until it died without sufficient time for a final hearing before House Finance.",

Divorce and remarriage are facts of life that demand rethinking of doctrine to quit punishing those damaged by a bad marriage.  Open communion is fast becoming a fact of life as concordants are reached with the other true presence faiths - as it should.  Contraception has two elements, sexuality and the question of life.

The answers to these questions should determine wether incarceration or treatment will be more effective in preventing the behavior when they are released, which is what we all hope happens with the tax dollars we spend for crime prevention. \n\nThere's interesting research that points to treating addiction versus jail time in being more effective at putting people on the right path. It's easy to think \"bad people go to jail\" but you have to ask what the point of jail is. Is it just to remove the undesirables from society or is it truly a \"correctional facility\" that's supposed to reform people?

Yet the reality is that China prospers even though it has hundreds of spoken languages. \n\nIt's even more interesting when you consider that China has an authoritarian government. If they wanted they could just tell everyone to speak Mandarin or else. But they don't. The government of China officially recognizes 56 different ethnic groups in the country. They don't see multiculturalism and multilingualism as a threat. Yet you'll still find Canadians who- 50 years later- condemn the fact that we have even two official languages.",

The same small group of non UAA individuals...but boosters of other programs... are still working hard to end Division I hockey at UAA as they were 20 years ago and beyond. The new Athletic director needs to listen to the hockey community and not sneaky little groups with self interests and figure out a way to bring the Hockey program back to its glory days. Very little advertising, no public support by UAA officials, and not being able to play in its own building like originally planned at the Alaska Airline Center are just a few of the UAA administrative failures. You can't operate a million dollar program with a 2 bit effort.",

It seems you would not be welcome in his group if you didn't check off all the slots on the rigid rules and regulations sheet.  Chaput then would decide you shoud not be included as a member of his exclusive team - because he only wants the \"smaller and holier\" crowd. He seems to have an attitude problem when it comes to people using their intelligence to make the right decision for themselves rather than blindly obeying churchy directives.  Chaput comes across to me as someone devoid of passion or empathy for his 'flock' and would appear unapproachable if one needed help. Sounds like an unhappy person.
