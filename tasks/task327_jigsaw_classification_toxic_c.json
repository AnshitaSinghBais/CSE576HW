It seems intuitive that since a single bus can fit 50-80 people, then if the City wants to decrease traffic congestion and improve mobility, why don't they simply add more buses?  The problem is that Honolulu's geography (narrow linear development between the ocean and mountains) squeezes Honolulu's traffic into a very limited number of major east-west thoroughfares.  This forces many bus routes to share the same roadways and results in a phenomenon called \"bus bunching\". \nBuses get caught up in clusters that crawl along at a snails pace, often with very crowded buses near the front and emptier buses in the rear.  For riders waiting at bus stops, instead of buses coming every 5-10 as scheduled, they get several buses all at once, and then long periods with no buses at all. I will explain more below.",

The history of the term \"Islamophobia\" is not that complicated, it was made popular by the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1990's - they engaged in a successful campaign to label any criticism (or satire) of Islam as religious discrimination  (Muslim Brotherhood is a political movement who's ultimate goal is society governed by Islamic law). The term found sympathy among the western campus left and self-titled social justice warriors in an pathetically ironic case of useful ignorance (given the sad state of civil society and lack of individual rights in countries governed by Islamism). The fact that women are forced to submit to male authority under the guise of piety and the fact that LGBTQ rights are non-existent seems to be lost among so-called \"progressives\". Political Islam is fundamentally incompatible with advanced civilized societies - the state of civil society and individual freedoms among the 57 members of OIC speaks for itself.",

It is 17 years old, but still highly relevant, as scientists who have abandoned the animal model in favour of clinical work, epidemiology, and human cell trials are starved for funding while the useless animal experiments waste money from governments and donors.  I also recommend that you read Rigor Mortis by Richard Harris.  I have just ordered this new book, so cannot comment, but appears to be a must read after Sacred Cows.\nHolly Wittman's presentation is likely pro-animal trials, as she appears to refer to the\ndiscovery of insulin.  Even that discovery is not necessarily (if at all) a result of testing on dogs, as I discovered in Sacred Cows.   \nI hope to find Prof.Naylor's report online. Thanks.",

I remember in the day that letters to the editor - if you could get yours printed - was like winning the lottery considering the high wall of critique a editorial editor would put on those letters, especially those with a different point of view. So, in looking forward, today's forums allow for many more to provide their input into a subject. \n\nNow whether that opinion is good or not, I think any opinion put out on this is as valuable as the next opinion. Those who post way more than I should understand that. \n\nBut one thing is for sure, don't let forums like this get so regulated so that a faceless, nameless newspaper bureaucrat determines what should be said in comments, and what should not.

Rosenberg apparently refers to future Liberal budgets as being 'tax the rich'. Do we need government spending or not? Should these be financed by wealth and income taxes or fees, tolls, and mandates? I personally hope that if funds are needed then it will be a 'tax the rich' method rather than taxing the poor!\n\nThe Conservatives have fostered the belief that services can be maintained without paying for them. They have reduced taxes so that we now have structural deficits. Conservatives lowered taxes but politically can not reduce services such as health care or OAS. It would be nice if Rosenberg were to acknowledge that. Taxes are necessary and it is better to tax the rich than tax the poor.",

This is because Congress and the mainstream media always discuss welfare in a fragmented, piecemeal basis. Each of the 79 programs is debated in isolation as if it were the only program affecting the poor.

The oocysts are the more common source of infection, which can occur from drinking contaminated water, inhalation of contaminated playground dust, contaminated dirt under fingernails, children putting fingers in their mouth that has previously contacted contaminated soil or water, etc.  Remember, we are talking about infectious oocysts that you can't see with your naked eye, millions of them, shed from a single infected cat, lasting over a year in soil or water.

Each station and vertical development rights have to be re-planned. And I also mean probably relocated. This TOD stuff is a joke in comparison. We have an elevated bus route, not a fully master planned system linking what we called 'social infrastructure' destinations. Hospitals, schools, shopping, government, visitor destinations, etc, need to be connected.

I get sick every time I hear J. Egar Hoover's name, never mind Johnson's.  We are a better country than the people who chose to change things to their liking.  I would hope Trump would reveal the truth on what happened and the people involved that HORRIFIC and Terrible Day.  The thousands upon thousands of Servicemen who gave their all to protect the United  States deserve an answer.",

Unlike our bishops in the past (not now) Protestant churches moved derelict clergy immediately, took them out of ministry. Our bishops in the past sent them to institutions for \"healing,\" not realizing that you cannot cure clerical or non clerical recidivism. I think most bishops have learned their lesson. But still the CC has this backlog of cases, of people who were abused by clerics, that has to be resolved -- all at the expense of the laity --- who built the buildings, paid for maintenance, upkeep, salaries, etc.\nI feel bad for them -- they get the black eye owing to the faults of our bishops.",

Well, guess what, innocence does not guarantee acquittal.  Usually, juries will go with the prosecutor because the prosecutor represents \"the people.\"  From the little bit that was reported on this case, it sounds like there was reasonable doubt.  Of course, we do not know what the \"injuries\" actually were.  A black and blue mark?  I suspect that they were in that category, but of course the details were not reported.

Syria is not within our sphere of influence and unless they directly threaten Israel, our nation really shouldn't care one way or another. When Obama supported the Arab Spring that led to the civil war in Syria, he quickly found out that with Syria, there is a special relationship with Russia and Obama realized that directly interfering with Syria, will result in direct conflict with Russia. Which is why US is so low key in that area.

The privilege of driving, in contrast, you not only have to prove eligibility, but also competency (well, for certain, very lax definitions of competency), and are subject to ongoing regulation of your behavior while driving. If your driving privileges are revoked or suspended, you have more limited legal recourse for restoration than you do for your right to vote.\n\nI think you are right to raise concerns about potential for conflating the two if people and even political leaders start to associate voting rights with driving privileges, but I don't think that inherently makes automatic registration a bad policy.",

At least some authority to make priests and bishops resides in the people in the pews as in the first century, people gathered in women's homes and chose their own leaders and presbyters. The Cosmic Christ will continue to 'emerge' unimpeded by pointy hats in Rome. But it would be better for them if they followed the words of Jesus about loving their neighbors.

Mr. Menor heard it again when he was at one of the recent Senate hearings on SB 1183. Maglev would not only meet the terms of the FFGA but could do so while staying within the available funding through 2027 of $6.8 billion. They seem to be concerned about any changes causing delays and rising costs; where were they when the current project produced those results? A Supplemental EIS covering maglev could be completed quickly; its guideway would be less physically and visually imposing and the train would be quieter and better for the environment. Complete Plan A with maglev. No new taxes.",

In relation to wars, we more realistically ascribe responsibility to the politicians who gave the orders.  When we discuss police actions, we get focused on the individual officers and not the policies that guide them.\n\nThose with involvement with the public safety/criminal justice system tend to get defensive and lose sight of the need to examine policy and tactics themselves independent of those who carry them out.

Tony Flannery did not celebrate a public Mass, it was a private Mass; for a final celebration with people who were close to him. In Ireland that can amount to a large number of people and it did pan out that way, in a rural community hall, near his own family's homestead . The large turn out reflected the esteem & respect for the man. They had to erect an outdoor large tv screen for the many who could not be accommodated inside the hall. I can assure you that good sense prevailed & no follow-up action that we are aware of , followed. Had there been any, a strong counter reaction would have followed across the country. Discretion was certainly the better part of valour, for the Papal Nuncio & the hierarchy, with the awareness of their own failures in the past. I think they were very wise, given the history of Tony's situation. Had it been under BXVI's reign; I have no doubt but that the religious police would have been on duty, etc.",

The USA has since built the fourth largest city in the country, in a known hurricane zone, in a swamp barely above sea level.  Proposed dikes have gone unbuilt.  All sympathy is due to the Houstonians, but the villain of the play is not the weather but a paralyzed political system.",

He is likely to fire Mueller and to pardon anyone who can hurt him -- including himself.\nThe fact that POTUS is crazy is not grounds to impeach, and the process for removing him because he's crazy is beyond cumbersome. He must be impeached for his crimes, which is itself a tough process. But the Congress must get on with it; I think they are already laying the groundwork. It would be malfeasance if they aren't.",

And clearly any workplace that employs interns and highly motivated low paid staffers willing to do anything to advance their career, and work within a culture where after hours work is  expected and viewed as necessary evil in gaining experience, is fertile ground for a serial offender. One solution is that staffers and interns need a body to look after their interests outside the control of their employer. Remember in this case the employer and the offender are the same in relation to the staffer/intern. What's really needed is some form of worker representation. Allowing interns and staffers to unionize would reduce many of the risk factors associated with this kind of workplace. Union representation would provide interns with some kind of voice, opening other ways a worker can show their worth other than socializing after hours.",

See:\nhttp://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/colorado/rankings\nThis movement has brought great changes to Colorado's public education, ones that I saw and experienced first hand with West Denver Prep.. \nXochitl Gaytan represents the union and their money which he got in great abundance and their interests in being opposed to such Charters that have more than shown their excellence in improving education.",

Say the robber knocks the lady down while snatching her purse, rendering her unconscious. When she comes to she's unable to recall anything about the incident. Does the robber get off by claiming he had consent to take her purse, a claim that she can't refute? Barring a case with no witnesses, no evidence of an assault and a victim with a history of losing consciousness, I would say not. Unfortunately, that's the situation in this case. There's no witnesses, no evidence of an assault, and the purported victim can't remember a thing.",

John Mbiti (1969) describes a concept of reality in traditional African thought as being rooted in the past and present, with very little weight being put on the 'non-real' space of the future. If we understand our students to be trapped in this inter-generational time-based reality, our task is to engage them educationally in ways that challenges this notion, by creating experiences wherein they see immediate benefits to science-based interventions within their own communities.

The merger was part of the plan for growth to obtain whatever their goal was for ROI or ROA. The government told them no, so they chose their second strategy which was to cut costs and increase efficiency. Right or wrong, that is how private industry works. Aetana knew they were negotiating from a much stronger position than the government and could live with whatever decision the government made. The problem the government has is that the ACA in the end is a bad program which can only work as long as the private sector gets what they need out of it. And when they don't, they walk.

For the other categories, based on the same time periods, these were the differences, with the NPR estimate following the CPI one: fish and seafood: 2.6%, -4.0%; dairy and eggs: -0.1%, -9.0%; bakery and cereal products: 0.5%, 0.5%; fruit and nuts: 2.2%, 9.0%; vegetables: 4.1%, 8.0%, other food: 0.7%, 3.2%; total food: 1.3%, 3.6%. (Weighting over the groups was based on 2015 basket shares at link month prices.) The difference between total food inflation rates when annualized (questionable since the data is raw) is 7.2 percentage points.",

Modern conveniences in isolated areas, $9 cell phone service with internet, a school the kids won't go to, with no finances from the corporation to help. One question is what has historically happened to other conquered people. They are killed, become slaves or assimilate. Not Native Alaskans, they get free health care, all the Medicaid and food stamps they can handle, plus getting to keep their land and have villages periodically rebuilt.

(The problem with it is that many people die of other causes before the die of cancer--this is more the case in the USA--so they are not listed as cancer fatalities). In any event, if the problem here was single-payer medicine, the problems in the UK would show up in other such European systems, which they don't. Your account of why drug costs are higher is false.

While it's understandable that some will wish to cling to the past for any number of reasons, the simple truth is that society is undergoing massive changes, and the church is not keeping up.  \n\nShould it \"keep up;\" should church leaders be willing to walk with their flock as change might suggest?  Or should the current path continue, wherein the bishops following the path THEY choose, knowing full well that most of their flock took the other fork in the road?  It's not lost on me that quite a few of the self proclaimed \"faithful\" seem to resolve this problem by simply redefining the flock, implying that the only ones worth saving are the ones that followed the path of the bishops?  \n\nI think that radical rethinking is becoming less and less an option, and more and more inevitable.

So, let's kill dual citizenship, enforce tax laws in full, tax vacancies, maybe limit foreign buyers to new, or one unit only, and so on.  Quit handing out visas like candy.

Although, nobody has com up with a credible argument for why we need the power Site C is intended to provide, it has been shown (by CANGEA) that geothermal can achieve the same levels of baseload power generation - incrementally (as we need it) at a comparable cost and less environmental/cultural damage.\n\nWhy doesn't John Horgan support this alternative?",

My focus was not on technology companies, it was on western Canadian oil and gas start-ups. I did very well but about 25 years ago I started shifting my investment focus to the dividend payers. My new portfolio is also doing very well.\n\nI mention this because I think an investor's focus or style must change over the investor's lifespan.  My equities investing life is now 45 years (I am 69). If I live as long as my parents did I could well have another 25 years of life that my equity investments must support. I can easily see switching my equity focus to ETFs picked by some robo-advisor.\n\nAlready I am losing interest in doing the research necessary for maintenance of my current portfolio",

I agree with the need to find common ground, but when you have two political philosophies that are so divergent, two worldviews that are so diametrically opposed, and the media that props up one side and perpetually diminishes the other there's bound to be conflict and division.

So, instead, they seek out less informed, blowhards representing the radical left and right views on the topic at hand and watch the ratings fly as they fling feces at one another. Over time, where these radical views are the only ones represented in the media, people begin to doubt their own centrist views and feel alone in having them. Eventually, many of these individuals begin to conform and support one or the other radical position so as not to feel ostracized by a completely manufactured group.

On one extreme you have corporations looking to turn a profit, and religions and idealogues looking to undermine public education. On the other extreme we have parents just looking for a better solution to their child's education. Long-term, those two agendas are often diametrically opposed to each other. Short-term, maybe not so much. My point is that turning over public facilities to charter schools is a slippery slope... in the long term.",

It recruited, trained, financed and supported them with advanced weapons. One such leader is called Osama bin Ladin, a valued CIA asset. This strategy worked so well it contributed much to USSR collapse. The CIA and Pentagon proceeded to adopt the strategy to spread insurgencies, civil wars and overthrow governments.

We conclude that the district court did not err in applying the sixteen-level enhancement because, under the modified categorical approach, Rocha-Alvarado’s prior conviction for attempted sexual abuse in the first degree pursuant to Oregon Revised Statutes § 163.427(1)(a) qualifies as a “crime of violence\".\"\n\nRocha-Alvarado was charged with three counts of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree, alleging that on or between March 24, 2012, and August 29, 2012, he subjected a nine-year-old girl to sexual contact by touching her vagina, breast, and lips.\n\nHe was deported in 2013 and this is his sentence for coming back in after deportation.",

When has he truly paid his debt to society?  What is the point of even having a justice system if after paying ones debt for actions committed as a child that one is never able to get a second chance in life?

When the government officially recognized AK Native tribes, they seemed to codify almost every separate native village as a separate tribe, which is radically different than how it was done with the Native American tribes where typically all the villages in an area with the same culture were grouped into a tribe.  That means that while there are fewer Lower 48 tribes, they are much larger.  Estimates place the total number of AK Natives living in AK right now as between 110,000-125,000.  If we were to consolidate those all into one tribe, it still wouldn't even break into the Top 5 of the largest federally-recognized tribes, and represents only about 2% of the total US Native population.",

In 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the monthly Silver Premiums after financial assistance for a 40-year old non-smoker making $30,000/year in Arizona was $207/month. In 2017, it was $207/month. That’s an increase of 0%.\n\nToday Trump tweeted that premiums went up 204% in Alaska. That's a very deceptive half-truth. First, that’s an increase over a 4-year period, not a one-year increase, and, second, it doesn’t factor in the financial assistance received by 93% of Alaskans. They are, in fact, paying less than they did in 2013 (if they could even get insurance before the existence of the ACA exchange).",

They report only the news that favor their liberal agenda, leaving much out, but has become what is now a new word in the journalistic lexicon of America, \"Fake News\". Look how they misled America in their polls the entire election, \"If the election were held today, Ms. Clinton would win by a landslide\". \n\n\nPersonally I ignored the polls on the election, picked Mr. Trump to win after the very first Republican debate, just as I did Mr. Obama even though  voted against him.

To think that Israel would form a lasting resolution with Philistine (Palestine) is going against their beliefs. You really can't dictate a country that is so embedded in history and religion.

The best rate to make up for these factors is the US U-6 rate-- often called the \"Real Unemployment Rate\" which adds to \"unemployed\" the people who have a sought a job but cannot get a job \"discouraged workers\", plus it picks up part time workers who have to work for economic reasons (they are counted as unemployed because they cannot find full time employment).

Only the strong survive, not only physically but mentally.  I think coaches need to back off and let the players play. Let the QB call the majority of plays. Let the defensive linebackers call the formations. Let the coaches run players in and out keeping them fresh. Once you can establish field position, then open things up and strike when odds are in your favor. Teams need more discipline including the coaches. That's why the Patriots are favored.Denver can beat these guys if they play together and keep focus. This team isn't used to having butts kicked.",

But wheat and potatoes? Does this mean that agribusiness corporations, again you can read multinationals, are looking for a better deal, maybe more land at fire sale prices, or perhaps a bigger slice of the farm subsidies in Canada so they more closely resemble those they get in the US.

I also am against wholesale corruption which this president is now giving us.  \n\nSad thing is the Donald has no idea what his job is.  His desire to slash the budgets for the secretary of state and things such as NOAA are just stupid.  Just curious, will you enlist if he gives us another war?

However, it seemed to be an example of the author cherry picking his way through a forest of inconvenient facts. Forbes, though not remotely as transparently biased as Fox \"News\" has a Panglossian bent toward the conclusion that capitalism, free from bothersome regulations such as Glass-Steagall, produces the best of all possible worlds. It's written for a readership of speculators and stock coupon-clippers. The author included Switzerland for which he had few stats, to prove a dubious point, while ignoring, i.e., Belgium, which has a similar population. He discounts accidents, violence and economics as unworthy of factoring into any analysis. He especially ignored the cost of Rx drugs. In 2003, when GWB pretended he really cared about bioterrorism, i.e anthrax, he bought a near-useless billion $ worth of Cipro, discounted to about $4.50 a  dose, declining the offer of the government of India to provide it at $.11 per dose.",

Using the brake to control the speed of the vehicle is more precise than using the accelerator and in conditions of low traction will help both drive wheels to turn rather than spinning one. This technique is called Controlled Throttle Management(CTM) and this is how it is done. Press hard on the brake pedal and shift into the appropriate gear. Gradually increase the throttle till the car is trying to move. Now with light removal and application of the brake, the car can be moved in tight increments with precise control of speed and position. Very little movement of the brake pedal is required and the throttle needs to be held at a constant engine speed - usually about 1000 rpm. When connecting trailers I even shift my truck into 4 low for even more precise control.",

I am often inundated by requests for referrals to good family therapists, child therapists, medication providers etc. Why not let the huge number of people in Anchorage who are using these providers and clinics give a consumer's opinion of their efficacy while also taking the category of mental health out of the shadows?",

There are tremendous expectations on the average citizen, and no one can dare broach the subject that maybe, just maybe, things are not quite as successfull as the government tells you it is. Politicians have visions of what they want, but it is left to the people to make those visions happen. People have changed, accommodated and bent perhaps as much as they can, and there is either nothing left or very little. The cracks in multiculturalism have allowed the hatred to gain a foothold, and it remains to be seen if we have the energy and the desire to resist.",

This contradicts DM's article the other day https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-10-24-capewatergate-how-the-citys-top-hotels-are-taking-action-in-the-drought/. It supports my view the tourism industry is a significant user/waster. Last week De Lille fatuously said the tourist influx won't 'cripple water supply' if residents 'save' water. Of course, she/they mean householders, NOT businesses, etc. What more must we do - recycle our own toilet water? They're mayors and ministers and are paid princely sums but have no clue. \nLast December 500K visitors arrived at CT airport alone (2016: 2.1m tourists incl 1.6m foreign). If each uses 100l/day (that's low; the real figure is probably twice), that's 50ML, excl supporting industry. The estimated total is 2000-7500l/tourist/day. \nIf tourists expect to bath, have two showers a day, use an open, topped-up pool and generally have a ball with our water, then they should stay at home. That includes Gautengers reading this.",
