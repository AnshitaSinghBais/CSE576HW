Killing his parent, ok, lots of reasons, he could have been abused, or acting in self-defense. We don't know at this point. But a shooting rampage at an elementary school? Never any kind of reason, it was cold blooded attempted murder. To make it worse, now these victims will have to go through a trial and relive this experience over and over for the next few years.

He did his time but my daughter has done 23 years of time, she got a f*&$ing life sentence. Don't you tell me he did his time over and over again these bastards get out and do it again. I say kill them all. I like this guy too. I wanted to kill the pervert that hurt my child but as a parent I needed to be here to help my daughter get the help she needed. Don't think killing him didn't cross my whole families mind. Screw them stop keeping them in jail and use that money to help the innocent children that are being hurt.

I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

Also, the only reason they're main day of worship conflicts with class is because the school boards were originally Christian, so Sunday was the day of rest and Saturday the prep day.\n\nFurther to some of the critiques I've read in the comments:\n1)Why this but no Lord's Prayer  \nThe Lord's prayer was removed because all students were required to hear it at the beginning of the day.

The chairman was put in by the NDP.  \n\nKenneth G. Peterson was appointed chair of BC Hydro on July 19, 2017.\n\nMr. Peterson's 40-year career spans a wide range of assignments in the electricity industry. The last 10 years of his professional career were spent as CEO of Powerex, the marketing and trading subsidiary of BC Hydro. He also served as a trustee of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation since 2006, where he applied his industry experience to the physical and cyber-security reliability challenges facing utilities.\n\nSuch a toady!  No industry experience at all, and not the most knowledgeable person in BC about power demand!\n(sarcasm)",

If a person takes one sided quotes by EGW and ignores others, you can make yourself belief this false idea.

Or perhaps you think they are all an example of \"feminism getting Bolshie\"? Yeah right. The key tenets of feminism are enshrined in our Constitution, PRECISELY BECAUSE they are political. 2) My wife and daughter DID ask themselves why, and they both decided that the answer was \"male entitlement to power over women\", although they disagree on many other things. 3) why don't you answer my other questions a) since your marriage? b) the ethical, let alone attitudinal aspects of your \"informal harassment survey\" of \"women I know\".

However, if we return funds to those who create jobs, viola, the jobs will grow. One final thought, it is not tax reduction that causes debt, it is over spending that causes debt. If you make $500 dollars a week, and you spend $300, you have a surplus, if you make $500 a week and you spend $700, you run a deficit. This is not rocket science people.

Jesus used every mode of communication at his disposal to jar the law-based mind sets of his listeners.  \"If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out.\"  Without using these precise words he also said, \"if line-drawing causes you to hinder metanoia by a sinner, pluck it out.\"",

In 1979,  Joe Clark won a minority promising to subsidize mortgages over 16% by increasing gasoline taxes, but then lost to Trudeau in next 1980 over the tax. The reason why interest rates were so high was because of massive inflation due to OPEC and runaway oil prices prompted by the Sinai War of 1973  and the Iranian Revolution in 1979,  among other factors. Governments tried wage and price controls in 1974-6 but they failed. The unemployment rate in 1982 incidentally reached 13% , exceeding anything reached in 2008-09.

Slavery is never a tolerable situation especially in a national monument.  Then you go on to say that hiring practices will continue regardless of where they are allowed to fish.  Not so fast again.

She literally turned the stomachs of many people I spoke with. Democrats, mind you, who voted for trump because they had too much self respect to hand the nation over to Hillary.",

One was fired for having hung up on 9-1-1 callers over many years. I'd say many of us would come back and avoid the 2 years of training and get us taking calls right away. Our knowledge and ability to do the job is priceless taking into consideration public safety. The contract does not allow for part-time. Many of have retired offering to stay part time. Its a dumb rule not in the best interest of the public BOEC serves. Change it. But of course it call comes down to management.

That means today you could already generate $31,600/year in dividend income.  Buy these stocks and reinvest the dividends.  If you are 48 and made 5% a year until you were 65 your $632,000 would be worth $1.5 million. With $1.5 Million you can generate income of $60,000 per year in dividends.

It won't make any difference in premiums anyway as those are driven by the cost of care. In the U.S. there is no real price competition among doctors, hospitals, medical supply and equipment companies and pharmaceutical companies, and that is one major reason why costs are so high. Another is that there are no price controls as most other countries have. Medicare, our largest insurance carrier is PROHIBITED by (republican) law from negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Can you imagine the negotiating power they would have? It would make Wal-Mart look small!  Lastly, insurance companies don't really insure anything, they process claims according to the policy you have signed up for, and take an average of 20% of every dollar that flows through them.",

Canada is an advanced progressive country and the belief system associated with face coverings is only common in countries that are regressive, authoritarian, and hostile to gender equality. Canada isn't \"different\" - Canada is advanced. Political Islam or Islamism is synonymous with social regression - just look at every single country \"governed\" by religious law (face coverings is a symbol of political Islamism).",

Specialised medicine and piped water are technologies, and certainly do not require violent subjugation of a population in order for them to be adopted and developed.

But, I also think that some people don't really need some sort of agreement from a priest - a seal of approval - they have already reached an understanding that they are walking a path of faith in a new marriage, that \"solace of conscience\".  \n\nIt is hard to break habits of thought and untether thinking that ties both mercy and faith to the law of the Church.  And scary.",

No matter how much people criticize F-35s problems or that it is single engine, etc.  You only need a few F 35s to kill several 4G planes.  Per plane cost comparisons are utterly foolish. In fact, 5G planes require different set of thinking including how people analyze their costs.  The F-35 acquisition, done right, may save Canada money.  You need fewer F-35s to achieve same objectives compared to many more F-18s.  Two engines also add higher maintenance costs and increase operating costs.  The F-35 engine is due for a major upgrade in 2020.  The new engine will increase efficiency by about 15% and reduce thermal signature of the aircraft making it even more stealthy.  The word \"under development\" should not concern anyone because list of expectations about the F-35 keeps on growing.",

However, there's been far too many, over 1,000, citizens that have been killed by police officers and many of them happen to be of color.  Federal investigation have also suggest that racial profiling has been a problem in many police departments across the country.  We simply can't ignore those facts.  The more high profiled murders of black men and black teenagers were unarmed.  That's a fact.  One can't blame the black or brown communities from being alarmed.  Public policies across the country need to change dramatically if we as a nation are to live in peace.  And yes, it's a horrifically sad day in America to wake up to reading or watching on TV the loss of five police officers.  There's no words  or enough empathy that can express their families and friends loss.  Heartfelt condolences for all involved.",

He achieved a great accomplishment, but it was in part due to his mentor putting herself out there and giving him a chance. More kids need this kind of a chance.

Thus, the work of the Spirit is freed from the theological straitjacket of Adventism, only to be seduced into the Procrustean beds of secular social justice, measured and cut to vindicate rights and moral necessities of gender parity. Thus, social justice turns the gospel upside down. Obligations of self-denial and servanthood are replaced with rights of self-actualization and mastery over others.",

They can never be absolute and immutable because they are enshrined in institutions which evolve with changes in knowledge, culture and history.

In other countries, there is more of a consensus about core values such as the role of gov't in enhancing the lives of citizens. I actually think a majority of Americans believe gov't should play a significant and positive role but powerful groups--the very rich--are breaking the social pact surrounding the role of gov't out of greed and use fear to manipulate. We're the majority and the super rich--the Trumps, the Kochs, they are a minority. We simply need to take the power back from these anti-American \"Americans.\" Tax the rich--they can afford it.",

When I learned Spanish in high school and continued with it at UAF, my grasp of English grammar was highly sharpened.  I've seen the same effect in others I know when they learned a second language.  I don't speak the native language of my ancestors, which is Irish, but I know some words and phrases, and it's opened a whole new door of understanding to me.  In that language, pronouns and prepositions are sometimes combined into a single word, and it's a whole new way of understanding relationships.

Here's a link to the first story in that series, which published in January.\nhttp://www.civilbeat.org/2016/01/death-in-paradise-is-all-too-frequent-for-visitors-to-hawaii/",

Jackson Lee being critical of President Trump?  Because she is a Democrat??? Hmm!",

And that many jail inmates are actually (not just technically or presumedly) innocent. And that is the part that Ms Godfrey is ignoring. There is nothing those innocent people can do to \"receive an earlier release to parole and not return to jail\".",

Benefits have been reduced over 20 times since 1995. The Court has allowed legal reductions. It has been utterly consistent about unilateral retroactive takings. The legislature may send out another illegal proposal the way they did last year, for political purposes, but it will have the same result: a waste of time, a diversion from the real tax and budget issues faced by the state, and--if it's like last time--a waste of a great amount of money and an intensified financial burden on state agencies. \n\nOregon needs tax and revenue restructuring.",

They  have other projects around the world with lower development costs and greater outputs, hence, they are profitable and moving to development stage. The price of natural gas is becoming decoupled from the formula of basing the LNG price on crude due to greater outputs and market forces. Consumer states such as Japan,South Korea,China India and Taiwan are all slowing their LNG imports and some are not even accepting their contracted LNG at fixed prices because its cheaper to buy on the spot (JKM) market.

For me, this issue comes down to integrity. The business community was sold a bill of goods by the city that this new tax was going to be used exclusively for arterial road repairs. They largely supported taking ownership of that infrastructure expense. The debt service piece was a city decision after the fact. There are two candidates who intend to honor the purpose of this tax - Swansen and Berrios. Berrios even had evidence at the debate to prove the original intent of B&O.

Europe's beacon of progressive liberalism that is Sweden is now dealing widespread \"no-go\" zones where Swedish culture is treated with contempt and crime and violence is flourishing. This isn't a rightwing conspiracy theory, it's a sad reality. The US certainly has its issues, whether it's skinheads in Virginia or gang violence in Chicago but North American media is very much ignorant to the dramatic changes in European society after 15 years of political impotence and hoping for the best. Western Europe is facing a dramatic regression and the weakness of European leadership is only compounding societal divisions.",

You will sign a representation agreement. And so on.\n\nYou would be a CLIENT. Businesses refuse clients all the time. By taking a deposit for a specific cake for a specific customer for a specific ceremony for a specific day, the baker is taking on a CLIENT. That is materially different than a customer pulling a cupcake off the shelf.\n\nI hope the courts are able to make this distinction.",

Still this new executive order is within the bounds of what Trump promised, what many Americans had sought, and - in theory at least - what passes for muster here in Canada. Bill C-24, you'll remember, was Harper's response to a growing public view that it should be easier to deport non-citizens and strip dual nationals of their Canadian citizenship if they commit serious (mostly terror related) crimes. The Liberals were intent on repealing it but, instead, have used it more frequently than the Conservatives. \n\nWhether this new plan proves reasonable will be determined more in the application than the theory. Enforcement often falls short of the legal capacity to deal harshly with immigrants who violate community standards. What the U.S. and Western European experience demonstrates is that it's far easier and better to prevent abuse of the system than to unwind it after the fact.",

The Genesis stories are somewhat allegorical and display a very deep understanding of Man (collectively) God and, in a way, how we arrived here. They are not, to me, myths. They are stories that mankind passed down from one generation to the next until someone set them down, they tell truth in an allegorical (not literal) way. The underlying theology in Genesis is remarkable and one can ponder them for years. Sometimes there is a human-like figure who is sometimes equated with Christ (The Son of Man was there from the beginning). The Jews did not allow graven images of God because they knew that he could not be represented as He is far beyond our imagining. God did indeed know that Cain killed Abel, he was looking for an answer from Cain as any parent would do when asking a child about doing something wrong. MichaelAngelo was an artist and he used the old man representation as an artist does to show God. Out of characters!",
