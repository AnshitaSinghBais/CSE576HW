I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

That wasn't injurous at all, I'm sure.\n\nStatistically, people who are at home during a burglary have a high chance of being injured or killed and that chance increases significantly if they are NOT armed. Having a gun and knowing how to use it (which this woman clearly did not) significantly increases your chance of survival.\n\nI'm sorry the burglar wasn't hurt, because he'll spend a few years in jail and be out doing this again soon. He probably won't even be charged with the appropriate crime ... which should be attempted murder.\n\nWhen someone burglarizes a house when people are home, they signal their desire to kill those they find within those walls. This is why it's legal to shoot an intruder, because they have signaled that your life is meaningless to them and in doing so they have ceded their own right to life. No criminal in the act of potentially taking another's life has a right to be protected from the consequences.",

Laying off lots of state workers, imposing an income tax, or reducing the Permanent Fund dividends are highly recessionary.\n\nBefore we do those things, we must:\n\n1.  Get a fair return for our oil.  We are giving away almost $10 billion dollars of oil per year and only getting a royalty.  This is flagrantly unconstitutional, and stupid.\n\n2.

Until your EV is capable of making all of the trips that your ICE vehicle can, rather than just the short trips around town, it's a niche product.",

Even the biggest rail supports could not honestly argue that anyone is excited about the current state of the project.\n\nToo bad no one in government has the fortitude to rethink the entire project, and go find companies that want to use our island as a proving ground for a 21st century mode of transport.",

Lee because they both owned slaves completely ignores the fact that one led the rebellion that started our country, and the other one led a failed treasonous rebellion aimed at splitting it.\"  Robert E. Lee was not the commanding general of Confederate forces at the outbreak of war in April 1861.  Secondly, Virginia was late in joining the Confederacy, and Lee was very late in making up his mind which group to join.  The fact that he and his wife had family connections to George Washington also made his decision difficult.  (I recommend  The Man Who Would Not Be Washington by Jonathan Horn).  The Union Army had a great deal of respect for Lee as evidenced by their treatment of his wife when she was captured, and with the capture of his son.  I join a group of historians who argue that the destruct button was pushed with the adoption of the Constitution and those two bitter clauses.",

Real estate across the board was a lower multiple of incomes and was typically growing at a far lower rate than it has in many markets over the last 10-15 years.\n\nEach year you delay buying to save now, you fall further behind.

People were shocked, actually, threw up and, sometimes,fainted as EMTs rushed in to bring them back to consciousness.  Movies express past, present and, even, future possibilities for mankind. Watching, together, we are transported...and we dream, we are horrified, we find hope and joy, laughter, tears and anger.  Movies bring people together on a deep level; even a theater of strangers find camaraderie in hating the bad guy and cheering on the good guy.  \nThe big screen cannot be replaced in creating the overall experience  that the producers intended.  And, the best part, there are no distractions at the theater.  The movie becomes our world for 90 minutes...and we become part of its world.  That's unthinkable at home! \nThank you for keeping movie theaters alive.  I will always be an avid supporter.",

It's about ensuring that only citizens are allowed to vote, that they are properly registered for the precinct, and that nobody else can vote while using their name.\n\nI'll say it for you again.  Think about why Senators and Representatives must appear on the floor in person for either a voice vote or a roll call vote.  They are not allowed to mail in their vote, nor send it by email from their home or office, even if they live thousands of miles away.  They are very busy or might be near death in hospital and might \"prefer\" doing that, but it is not allowed.  So perhaps you should tell Congress to allow its members to vote by mail or email -- after all, they might \"prefer\" it, and it might be \"easier.\"",

This type of standardization is what accounts for the longevity of the Church, and, as I see it, the re-visiting of this concept with the invitation of Protestants to Vatican II and its execution is why the Church seems to be falling apart.

Of course, gun violence isn't a public health problem, it is a crime problem, so CDC is not really an appropriate agency to do such research, and doctors have little to no expertise in, nor demonstrated familiarity with, the subject.

This means that you will not show a gain from the sale and will have no taxable income from it. If Trump sticks to his plan to get rid of the ability to step up the basis, then when you sell the home that your parents bought a couple decades ago, you will likely show a significant taxable gain. Of course, Trump has also talked about getting rid of the capital gains tax at every income level, so in that case no one pays anything... This is something to watch as they reshape the tax code, as for many the only real asset they have is their home and it could be a downward shift in taxes.",

A Harvard study from 2001 found that 85% of those who attempted suicide this way were successful.  Suffocation (hanging) came in second at 69%.  All other methods were well below 50%.\n\nSecond the availability of guns increases the likelihood of attempting suicide.  It's quick and requires little pre-planning.  Guns play an outsized role in spontaneous suicides.  Someone in a momentary crisis situation with a tendency toward depression and perhaps under the influence of alcohol or drugs grabs a gun and it's over.  A noose requires work,  other means lead to prolonged periods between initiating the attempt and death, which gives time for an intervention or for the suicidal person to seek help.\n\n2/3 of our gun deaths are suicides.

Over time you are supposed to reduce the number of permits, so that the auction price rises, progressively deterring the activity.\n.\nBut political pressures generally cause far too many permits to be issued originally, to lessen the belly-aching of those who complain (again, as happened with coal in Germany.)\n\n(cont'd)",

Then, an American manufacturer bought the rights to the drug and obtained \"orphan drug\" approval. Since the drug was now made by a US manufacturer, Canadian import was now prohibited, and the American manufacturer jacked up the price by 5 or even 20 times the Canadian price.

Yes, if we made all major decisions wisely by planning how this would affect the next seven generations we would have a healthy, positive and interesting future to look forward to.

If they were still deferential to the clergy, they were less so that their parents were; if priests were still on a pedestal, the pedestal was lower and the parents of victims were willing to take down the priests who harmed their children.

Others might--have have--debated the point.  If you've got the stomach for it, read Hidden From History, the Canadian Holocaust.  The term holocaust is not used lightly. Much of the book is dedicated to examining the many parallels.  \n\nBack when Lester Pearson was Secretary of State for External Affairs, the UN gave our Nobel Peace prize winner the opportunity to sign off on its definition of genocide.  Pearson declined to sign. The US didn't sign it either, likely for the same reason: the UN's definition, in many ways, described what had happened to Native peoples in both countries. Instead, what Pearson and others did, was coerce the UN into narrowing --changing--the definition. STILL isn't signed to this day.\n\nCan't believe this?  WON'T believe this?  Sure.

My understanding is that it was youth from the community that went door to door to in an effort to convince government to move forward with the bike lane.

Every advertiser had at least a business name, contact name, full mailing address, phone number and email address associated with their account. Apparently Facebook did not even have this basic protocol, or they would not have been \"tricked\" into taking money from the Internet Research Agency (aka Russia's troll factory) for 3000 ads (allegedly)... $30 each, wow.",

It is precisely the fact that parents don't even bother to articulate it, but act on it, that makes it rock-bottom basic to our society, unlike others.\n\nParents send their kids out into the world, and encourage them to do so. If a shy girl is reluctant to socialize with others of both genders, that  is considered a problem and parents and teachers will try to encourage her to do so. Our organisations are mixed gender, those that were closed to women were the object of feminist pressures to become so. \n\nMennonites are a red herring, I am not talkineven those Mennonites mingle socially with unrelated others in their community, young people have social activities in order to meet their potential mate, etc. ., and I'll bet the girls are encouraged to do so.

Progress on the issue was not made until Republicans Jim McEntire and Bill Peach joined the Board of Natural resources and pressed the issue with DNR. The idea of re-conveyance was considered an option, not a cure, should DNR fail to address the arrearage.

Even teens with a better understanding may not have the maturity to accept the reality of death’s effects.\"\n\nAnyone who has ever lost someone to suicide knows this is not how it works, that shattered survivors spend years coming to terms with why, and that the only response from the universe is silence.",

Rather than supporting tin dictators around the world we should be supporting freedom.  I am frankly tired of having to pay taxes to feed the worlds largest military industrial complex.   We are getting weaker by the day because we ignore real problems while fighting imaginary fears.  Doesn't it bother you at all that the United States has fallen behind?  I am sure you are aware that Canada is ahead of us in percapita income?  Why do you think this is?",

He may not be the smartest or most qualified guy in just about any room, but his money allowed him to marry and reproduce with a succession of models, star in a reality television show, live in vulgar gold-plated glory, say whatever offensive thing danced through his brain and still make a successful run for president....\n\nMost American men are unable to actually achieve this level of authority minus accountability; as a result, admiration for men like Mr. Trump gets paired with an “if I can’t have it, no one can” nihilism. White male power remains a dominant force in America, but it is no longer the only force that matters.

His favorables were also much higher, often with a spread as much as 25 points.\"\n\nhttp://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/11/13/polls-showed-sanders-had-better-shot-beating-trump-pundits-told-you-ignore-them",

But illegal entries are down by, iirc, 70% under Trump. Hence these former expedited removals can also be expected to be down. If administrative detentions are nonetheless up this implies a considerable increase in interior enforcement and, hopefully, after a delay proportionate to the longer time it takes to process interior removals, a corresponding increase in deportations from that source. An eye will have to be kept on this to mqke sure the reluctant Obama-staffed immigration courts are doing their job expeditiously.",

That keeps my other gloves dry. I use a two-layer system. Old, worn-out Gore Tex type shells for parka and pants...with a thin, less breathable rain parka and pants shell over that. Seems to wick away body moisture. Idea is not the get the inner shell wet before putting on the real rain gear. I use gaiters to keep rain and drips from wet brush out of my boots. My tarp tent has no floor...wet at first but dries out eventually. I can wear my wet boots inside...and the dog can come in if she wants. I pack all rain gear for easy availability...zippers unzipped, etc. Because, when it starts to rain it can come quickly and soak everything while the pack is open and I am fumbling around.

Remember Hawaii had become a U.S. Territory.

We are now a people, however, that can vote. You all know we have two-thirds of the votes in this country...If you want to rule, it is for you to decide\". \nPolynesian-Hawaiians had the largest voting block, and the most representation in the Territorial Legislature up until the 1940s, but still are a voting block that victimizing politicians go after today.",

Planes have been working steadily on their fuel efficiency issues since the '70s and it's had an impact. If the celebrities would give up private jets and go economy class, you'd see an even greater drop in energy-per-human cost. By contrast, we're doing more solo driving. The issue is whether people recognize it's a problem and act accordingly to do what they can do today. Obviously, a family in a rural area may not be able to give up a car. But in my city, many more people could. It's laughable when I see some hulking SUV occupied by a lone well-heeled suburbanite emerge from a downtown parking garage onto a tiny street where most people are walking.

Lack of inventory can come from a lot of things but here is one I haven't seen mentioned anywhere. Much of the purchasing the last few years is foreign money - perhaps 30-40% of the houses in Burnaby are now owned by foreign money. These were bought before the new tax so if someone wants to sell and buy another place here then on top of the realtor's fees and property transfer tax they are going to have to pay another 15%. So there is increased incentive to just stay put - especially if you are buying as an investment rather than a home. So the 15% foreign buyer tax is actually acting to prevent sales of homes already owned by foreign buyers - lowering inventory and sales. But that doesn't mean the market is crashing.",
