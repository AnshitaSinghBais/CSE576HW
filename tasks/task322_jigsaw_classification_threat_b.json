Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

Having incidents of alleged sexual misconduct become unexpectedly nationally exposed and having media attention consequently fixated on the survivors themselves, is not quite 'taking a bullet' or delegating a task. It's using traumatic events as a scapegoat, forcing all obligation of action to be placed on the survivor and having them constantly relive and have those moments scrutinized- partly through responses to articles, it's awful. \n\nThis article is highlighting that Trudeau should step up and into the feminist title he cast on himself and stop using women as political cover or as scapegoats. Also a note, to say this shouldn't happen to women doesn't mean it should happen to men, amazing that these comments become some 'if men can deal with it women should too' no one should.",

Throw in salmon spawning rivers and the Bay they wash out into, the Yup'ik aboriginal way of life being at stake, and a renewable resource that brings millions into our economy and, of course, they're going to work together!

This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help.

Legalism in the face of such things is cowardice. In this case, no doctrine was as bad as wrong doctrine or worse allowing bad proof texting regarding scriptures on slavery, which were underlined by the belief that the end was near and all slaves would be free anyway. Bad proof texting is not doctrine, but it can be part of it, like those regarding receipt of Communion when you don't believe it is real (mortal sin was not a thing in ancient times) or reading too much into Mark regarding divorce, if you wish to be relevant to this article. Sadly, bad proof texting can become traditional doctrine, which does not render it less bad. Bad proof texting adds authority to bad doctrine and usually no one had the courage to object.

An income tax is fair.  A federal income tax is fair.  If your tax rate is too high then you have the option of working less, making less and paying less.  Me?  I'd be happy to pay the highest rate because that would mean I have a HUGE amount of money.  Keep in mind that many of the poor pay 2 and 3 or even 4 times the costs in Anchorage.

Animals that are fed glyphosate-sprayed crops ingest the glyphosate, which is released from the plant proteins they digest. The animal incorporates glyphosate as it makes collagen, which taints bone broth made from animals fed glyphosate-treated crops. People vary in their vulnerability to glyphosate.

In exchange, NK was to receive two light water reactors and annual shipments of heavy fuel oil during construction of the reactors, funded by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), a multinational consortium.  The International Atomic Energy Agency sealed and placed surveillance equipment on NK’s nuclear power plants.  NK violated the agreement in December 2002 by cutting off the locks and disrupting surveillance equipment.  It kicked IAEA inspectors out of the country, restarted its nuclear reactors and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.  Bush tore up nothing.

Aren't you running them 24/7 like they do downtown?\" I asked. \"Oh yes, was the reply, but we only have limited slots for in-patients, Emerg comes first. I don't make the rules here. There may be spaces before then but we really don't know\". Meanwhile, she had waited 2 overnights in the emergency to even get into the bed. No wonder there are no acute beds. This system is really messed up. Brand new hospital, silly rules and people on gurneys in the emergency department almost from the day the place opens.  Of course, had she been mobile we could easily have paid for a private MRI right away. I put up a fuss and surprise, she got scheduled the next day. Wow",

Yes, parents had a difficult time getting on the base and participating in their children's education.   Here is my question:   Since a majority of the (current) ASD schools are grouped in the area near the Government Hill Gate, why can't the land be deeded over to the Municipality?   Clearly, that is what happened with Government Hill School.    The official fence and \"gate\" can be moved beyond the ASD buildings, and access would be easier for civilians and school personnel.   Military parents would have no problem going in and out.  The federal government has already combined and downsized JBER and might be amenable.

Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. \n\nProduction values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine. \n\nI wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.",

As drilling technology advanced and opened new opportunities on private lands, prices dropped to $2.25 or less, meaning Americans had half of their fuel budget to spend on other things, so business activity naturally increased. Illegally saving GM and Chrysler had more to do with buying union votes in important swing states for Obama's 2012 election win, as did his distribution of stimulus funds to green companies like Solyndra and other well connected liberal cronies to squander.

Another idea is to sell half a  position that has really gone up and let the other half keep running.  Put the proceeds into short-term MMF or high-interest savings and then wait for opportunities.  I like the idea of focusing on individual companies and not \"the market.\"  For instance, the market seems to have decided that bank earnings are going to explode, while telecoms are now in the doghouse because of the fear of rising rates.

Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. \n\nProduction values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine. \n\nI wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.",

On Saturday, Metro counted 275,000 trips before  11 a.m., also surpassing the figure from the previous morning.\"\n\nI agree that this is a largely peripheral issue, but the public debate about it wouldn't be now taking place had Trump's camp not exacerbated it.

The \"bad effects\" contribute to the imbalance of insurance, health care and long-term detriments to society everywhere in the world. Those who have studied the \"effects\" of pot ingestion worldwide, see some similarities but not the degree of devastation of alcohol abuse.  The \"responsible drinker\" comes up against one serious problem; the tolerance effect of alcohol.  In order to achieve the same \"effect\" long-term, I think it is well-documented that larger doses are needed.

Several mass shooters attributes their violence to far fetched reasons--conspiracy theory stuff, but were mentally unstable and had failures in life. This massacre was, I feel, more from a mentally unstable, confused man who chose this ISIS cause as his reason when it's more likely he was at the end of his rope for other reasons (conflicted about his sexuality, failed marriages, powerless, had history of mental instability). Banning Muslims is not only against our constitution and values but is inflammatory and misses the point. Mental health and FBI background checks on weapon purchases and banns on semi-automatic rifles are more reasonable.",

The oocysts are the more common source of infection, which can occur from drinking contaminated water, inhalation of contaminated playground dust, contaminated dirt under fingernails, children putting fingers in their mouth that has previously contacted contaminated soil or water, etc.  Remember, we are talking about infectious oocysts that you can't see with your naked eye, millions of them, shed from a single infected cat, lasting over a year in soil or water.

The OIA is acknowledging it cannot compete regularly, and anyway the chances of a State Championship are one or two or three out of 67.   All it gets is temporary bragging rights.  Sometimes, the consequences of sports celebrity can be really bad if following a Championship, a player washes out as an adult (e.g. \"Former State Championship Football Player Charged In . . . \").  There is far more positive publicity and pats on the head for getting a sholarship or getting a college education.   People rightly or wrongly think a private school education increase the chances of getting those two things.  So, for most private school families and students, icing private schools out of State tourneys by playing games is almost validation by vindictiveness, and definitely a minor insult in the grand scheme of things.  The OIA is only, tragically, highlighting that.",

The real story is, Pt Orchard residents voted against the change in city status in 2013, and every few years before that.  This year, their city council changed tactics:  instead of asking citizens to vote and getting told \"no\" again, the council simply enacted the change and dared its citizens to stop it.  Sound familiar?  Only here it was fluoridation, not city status, and the city went to court to defeat the citizens' petition to stop it.\n\nI've been pondering why PO's council would behave like this.

Where is he/she? \n2. Accountability: this obviously starts with the culture that leadership establishes. As a start in ensuring transformation, mayors' offices should be located in the poorest parts of the city they administer. \n3. A Social project that focusses on Child and Adolescent wellness - this will transform society beyond handing out of social grants that seems to be DSD's main order of business. And prepare our future leaders.\n4.

If you were to say only look at the highs of that month, you would see more noise in the signal. A monthly average smooths that out. That's not to say there isn't value looking at the extremes, I looked at the lowest temperature every year in Fairbanks at the airport and found that the cold days are disappearing. In fact 2012 may be the last year -50 was observed at the airport, it used to be quite common here.

The final stage in a sacrifice is the sharing of the victim to enable a distribution of the numinous among the believers.\nThe same ritual can be reinterpreted from a different perspective. Instead of the sacrifice as explanatory key, the meal can be understood as Christ's purpose. Christ died so that we can share in his life. The concluding communal meal is a more effective key today than the rarely experienced ritual sacrifice, in a Church based on communion.\nOne event, understood in two ways, can easily become two different ways of experiencing a common practice.

Since all the problems the US faces require higher taxes and more involved government, Trump (and the GOP in general) are doomed to fail - assuming, of course, that governing for the public good is even of concern to them.

Bears were least of my problems on that trail.....waiting for the early heart attack had more chances. Bears create hype, like a rock star on drugs! From everything I read, my own experiences, bears are quite an individualist and most really want nothing to do with humans unless you got bacon and beef glue to your clothes. Or appears to be threatening their young ones. But there are rogue bears......just like there are rogue humans. Cancelling Crow Pass race is worthless and meaningless since the risks you have this year, will be the same next year. So why bother? My guess would be: due to fear, not due to safety.",

What we had was a fiscal policy problem with taxes and regulations, which are not under the purview of the Fed.  They created $4.5 Trillion of debt, and under Dodd Frank, no one could qualify to borrow it, except for large publicly-held corporations and banks, who used the $2.5 Trillion borrowed money to buy back their own stock, which didn't create a single job, but did make CEO stock options worth tens of millions.  Now, in addition to record government debt and student loan debt, we have record amounts of corporate debt, mostly at variable rates tied to prime, as the Fed raises interest rates, which will reduce corporate earnings and cause the stock market to decline eventually.

Just how, pray tell, does a central bank justify drastic interest rate cuts when the preferred measures of underlying inflation are well above the 2% target and closing in on the 3% upper bound? The CPIX measure quite properly excluded the mortgage interest cost index, while the three new measures do not exclude any series. So now the Bank of Canada is the only inflation-targeting central bank in the world that includes mortgage rate changes in its preferred measures of underlying inflation, which is against all reason.

Doug Porter expects a 1.50% overnight rate by the end of 2018, which would finally take interest rates significantly above what Poloz inherited when he took office.

In the last couple of years we can see the tide turning and several homes have gone on the market and are now owned and occupied by families.  We are convinced that the  new student high-rises are squeezing the market rates and causing some landlords to sell the single-family homes (also helped by increased home values).  This new tower on Franklin will put even more pressure on the market and, hopefully, get more students out of single-family homes in our neighborhood.  And, for the record, there are several large student housing buildings in our neighborhood (around Matt Arena and Franklin Blvd) and we are fine with that.  These high-rises are managed well.",

My hypothesis there was that the current western epidemic of sexual attraction/identification disorders currently results in large part from the irrational belief that men and women are to all intents and purposes identical.  It's not instructive to equate western-style “gay” homosexuality with animal behaviour.  Simply because a behaviour can be found, commonly or rarely, among animals does not make it moral (that’s not what ‘natural law’ means).

And it's a fact that Trump won the election mainly because of the \"uneducated voters\" in our country. There's no denying it. Thanks to the Trump voters, our country is in the most dangerous, divisive, and troublesome time we've been in our lifetimes.
