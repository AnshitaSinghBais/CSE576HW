This is the most cold hearted, callous act for anyone and then to have the Mother and son do do this together makes me sick. Of course the Mother claims she doesn't know if her underage son was drinking! She reeked of alcohol herself which means, that yes, he was drinking, she probably gave him the alcohol and then they decided to wait several hours for the driver's blood alcohol to go down. He only came forward because there were multiple witnesses!! I am sick. This is some of the most vile behavior I have read, they stopped the car, and he got out and pulled the victim from his windshield and threw him on the ground. They both need to be charged with the MAXIMUM punishment possible. Mother & son deserve to be shot.",

I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

Children can then throw rocks at the corpses.  Dundas Sq will nicely for that.  If all else fails to exterminate gays there is still the simple gun shot to the head, or sword to the neck.

I can imagine a scenario where government policy to reduce emissions actually increases emissions over time because it increases the amount of time before better alternatives are brought to market.  \n\n\"Investing in green energy\" really just means subsidizing certain politically-connected businesses to the detriment of others in much the same way that Hawaii's \"dispensary\" law was written.  Government simply cannot keep up with the rapid pace of technological progress in the 21st century.  It's too slow and inefficient.  It is a barrier to progress more than anything.  GMOs are a great example of this.  The only problem with GMOs are entirely created by the government (patents).",

I suspect debt holders took a huge loss too. New shares were then issued in a new company, Ace Aviation. It is misleading to say that Air Canada emerged from bankruptcy since in reality it was a new company at that point with the former owners wiped out.\n\nRobert Milton was paid tens of millions and ran Air Canada into bankruptcy.",

The reason the Liberals changed the policy to create a 'capability' gap was to delay the inevitable decision to procure the F-35A and keep their election promise of buying the F-18 Advanced Super Hornet. By buying the 18 ASH they are either spending money recklessly (in the case of another aircraft being chosen) or have 'fixed' the process to have a pre-determined outcome (a full ASH fleet). Thing is the ASH is a prototype at the moment and it will take years to get it to full rate production. Most likely into the same time frame as the block 4 F-35. The projected fly-away costs of both will be very close by then.  And assuming the F-35's 'defects' have been corrected it will be a superior aircraft in just about every category.

Most returned to their ship as the revolutionary Provisional Government maintained order. 10 weeks later the last troops were gone.\n\nFor the next 5 years there were zero U.S. troops in Hawaii.

Both Oman and Iran claim 12-mile territorial water boundaries, the effect of which is to leave no \"international waters\" in the Strait.  The US has not recognized these claims, and asserts the right of its warships to transit the Strait at will without giving notice.  The end result is basically a \"might makes right\" situation.\n\nAlmost all the recent confrontations have occurred in these disputed waters, but the exact location is critical.  Until then, we need to be careful about thumping our chests and threatening retaliation, because Iran does have the same right as any other nation to control its own waters.",

Also, there is a distortion of their perception of the human person because of their disordered attraction so reason and love of the deposit of faith and love of the sheep would seem to preclude all but the most negligibly same sex attracted, keeping in mind the attacks of the evil one are sure to come.

Natural gas that is cheap because of the very fracking you oppose. It is clear the business about transparency is simply a ruse to retard or stop future fracking in the region. Hopefully one day soon the technology will be on hand where renewables can meet all our energy needs on a predictable and consistent basis.

When the long term sequestered products are added to the normal biological actives is where problems come in.\nThe ecological impact is also not accounted for.  The ecological impact of cutting rainforest for grazing is large but the replacement of grazers is small and may be positive in terms of ecology.

First, regulating corporate money to ensure that no one gains more access or ability to influence would also include, by the very definition in this legislation, unions, environmental activitist groups, ACORN, churches, NOW, and any other group of people gathered together for a common cause. Sure, everyone hates the corporations </sarc>, but what about the NEA and the Sierra Club? They are corporations of a sort, and clearly fall under this proposal's guidelines for control. Second, the idea that access and influence can made equal simply by passing a government regulation is absurd. What guidelines would be used? Who would make the determination? How do you prevent the rule makers from acting to limit access or ability to influence?",

It will approximate the rate of fire of an automatic rifle. \n\nIf you need to know the difference:\nA bump fire stock increases the rate of fire of a semi-automatic rifle to about 400 rounds per minute.  \nA C8 automatic rifle like our Canadian Infantry uses have a cyclic rate of 750 to 950 rounds per minute. \nWhat remains unspoken in the discussion is that both of the above rates are limited by how the cartridges are fed into the gun: a 30-round magazine, which is standard capacity on an AR15, would be empty in seconds and require replacement. A C8 operates so on a 100-round drum or is fed by a disintegrating belt.\nThe lightest machine guns, like the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, are substantially heavier than an infantry weapon. They have rates of fire of 800 rounds per minute, while heavy (typically mounted) machine guns have a lower rate of fire.",

The children should also have tutoring for school when needed, and also an opportunity to feel accepted an loved.\n\n\nLet's hope that the sanctuary movement grows all over the U.S.  There are many good folks who need the help and hopefully Catholic Charities, with good people like you can, once again, be a leader in this movement.",

Some of them appear to be more in the line of mafia enforcers than shepherds.  We can only hope Francis can make a difference in the long run by 1) encouraging bishops who may have been too fearful to really be shepherds under the axe wielded by JPII and BXVI and 2) appointing bishops who are less concerned with enforcing rules and more concerned with walking in faith with people at all stages of their faith development.\n\nThe Church has taken 50 years to really begin to implement Vat II structurally.

However it's not that simple: 34% identify as moderate, and since 1992 conservatives have dropped fairly steadily from 42% to 36% while moderates have remained more or less the same, sometimes making up a higher percent than conservatives; and liberals have increased from 17% in 1992 to 27% this year. Some moderates are bound to be more conservative, some more liberal.  As I said it depends on where you stand - I consider myself to be more moderate than liberal, while you might think I'm a flaming liberal. Believe me, I'm not! For instance, I think health care for all is a position everyone could get behind, while privatization of all schools is a radical approach, just as public ownership of all newspapers would be a radical concept.

The provinces have all the same taxing powers of the federal government except for import duties but they also collect all the money from lotteries.  Of course, to stop funding the provinces the federal government needs to drop their taxes by exactly the amount of the cut in transfers or it will be nothing but a huge tax grab.  By having the federal government inserting itself into provincial funding simply increases the bureaucracy of both to monitor and report on the spending.\nSecond, provinces are mature forms of government that are responsible to the voting public.  If the residents of the province doesn't like what the provincial government is doing, it can vote them out.  Hence it makes perfect sense to provide equalization payments with no strings attached.",

She's a singular figure in the judiciary, the longest-serving Chief Justice, and one of the best -- if you compare her tenure to some of her predecessors, she was far better at locating consensus than the sometimes fractious courts in the years immediately after the Charter.\n\nThe next Chief Justice will, based on precedent, most likely be Justice Abella (the senior puisne justice has been appointed in all but four cases, and two of those were slightly modified seniority; only twice has seniority been thrown out entirely), while the new puisne justice, drawn from the West, will give Trudeau the opportunity to add greater diversity to the bench that he clearly wanted with the Atlantic seat but couldn't manage.",

Rather than \"remain firm\", my suggestion to the Canadian government would be more along the lines of \"keep your mouth shut and be adaptable\".  In some ways the US is just catching up to Canada's protectionist attitude.  Canada has long been a lousy free-trader when it comes to areas like medical services, agricultural products, or simply subsidizing favoured businesses with government grants.  And the US has tired of being the market for all of the worlds cheap goods.  But as the playing field shifts, we are still in the best position to take advantage of the US market, especially if we keep our mouth shut and don't get all preachy about our neighbours.  \nAnd with regard to Russia's President Putin, who I'm no fan of, Trump has simply looked on the store shelves to see whose products are putting Americans out of work, and decided it would be better for the US to be friends with Russia, and enemies with China.",

The politicians don't care about the cost; it's all about votes and power, and who receives the money spent.

You can't find out where the money went, but I'll bet they're all associated with Democrats. Reminds me of the rail project. Yes, the Dems are strong in Hawaii.

He is the strongest advocate for victim/survivors in the Irish hierarchy and is not afraid to speak out and express his views.

They agree with business being allowed to not only restrict what types of birth control their healthcare plans offer, but even more recently the Republicans in Missouri proposed legislation that would allow a company to fire a woman who even uses birth control. And in general, the GOP is against \"handouts\" or \"entitlements\" and wants to reduce the number of people being supported by those programs, without any solutions on what to do with those people once they are no longer supported.\nIf \"some\" Republicans dont support those measures, thats great - but it certainly puts you in the minority, and it also goes against the general GOP agenda that they are actively pushing through right now.",

Those large quantities of carbon dioxide are being produced by human activity, namely the heavy burning of fossil fuels (coal, gasoline, etc.).

Once humans had figured out how to control and manage fire, we started producing extra CO2.  For most of human history, the amounts of CO2 produced by human activity were still pretty small.  However, in modern times, we have figured out how to utilize VERY concentrated sources of carbon, namely coal and petroleum, to produce energy.  This results in the release of larger quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere which tends to hold in the heat of the sun and prevent it from radiating back out into space.  This extra heat, in turn, is  changing the climate of the earth, making some areas dryer and less suited to agriculture.",

Requiring people to call for an appointment for bulky item pick-up\nwill result in increased illegal dumping and just dumping in general on the streets\nand will also allow the City to impose pick-up fees which is the real reason they want to\nchange to an appointment only system.  Kahikina's claim that general revenue funds\nbeing used to subsidize refuse operations is being taken from funding for fire, police,and\nparks is a lot of bull. Where does she think the funding for her department and\ntherefore the funding for refuse operations come from to begin with. I am surprised\nshe did not claim that funds were also being taken from seniors services and the keiki.\nRather than cracking down on the abuses in her department, as usual, the solution is\nalways more funding.",

Hopefully, common sense will prevail instead of concern for corporate profits or political careers.  We're responsible for protecting our children and environment from these hazards & we can't do that without this much-needed data.  \n\nSeveral studies have found household dust in homes on or near soils impacted by persistent pesticides is much more contaminated than outdoor soils. It's attributed to all the persistent pesticides tracked & blown into homes that become trapped in enclosed spaces, enabling higher & higher concentrations to accumulate inside homes over time. These studies suggest those who live on or near pesticide-impacted soils or agricultural areas where persistent pesticides are or have been used may be at risk of harmful pesticide exposures inside their homes year-round, whether pesticides are being applied or not.",

So, there is, as of 2010, a Parliamentary district called Kensington, which includes Grenfell Tower.\n\nSeparately, there is an administrative Borough (municipal district) called Kensington and Chelsea, which also seems to include Grenfell Tower at its very northern tip.

I didn’t press him on it but I understood where he was coming from and felt he was a free man and had every right to make his own choices. \n\nLike me he questioned the validity of Western religious dogma.\n\nFor what its worth, I too identify with the Jewish people more than I do the typical White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. And that is where I’ll stay, like a tree planted by the waters, I shall not be moved, with one exception. I would rather return to the religious beliefs and customs of my Ancestors, but that is almost impossible.

Some as far away as Ninilchik, for basketball competition. Other times Kenai or more remote (from Seward) Homer.\n\nWe had Bookey's fare after playing baseball in the nearby field, before the roadtrip back toward Seward, in the early fall in the late 1960s. The trip was slower back then, as folks generally traveled under the speed limit, and roads designed for 45-50MPH.\n\nIt was a treat; food & service was good.

Cleary it is time to call our the real nut bar funder who spreads hate through out the world.. Saudi Aribia.",

He was very concerned about the ruthless and corrupt behavior many real estate agents had in other cities and was proud that the Eugene-Springfield area was not like that.  Fast forward nearly 30 years, and, yes, unfortunately, some real estate agents in this area have become ruthless and corrupt; however, I cannot picture Mr. Nelson as being one of those agents.  Mr. Nelson was very honest and actually helped his students to achieve their professional goals without asking for anything in return.  I am not a real estate agent nor do I have any professional position or financial interests in real estate other than owning my home; so, I am not coming to his defense as a real estate agent, just as an observer.",

When Gorsuch was nominated Democrats were relieved it wasn't the other two candidates, who were awful. But from the start, legal scholars, while complimenting Gorsuch's temperament, used his past rulings and statements, not to criticize, but to point out how Gorsuch had ruled in the past. If the past predicts the future, Gorsuch will rule in favor of corporations and in opposition to the rights of actual humans. Revisionist?

Eventually the official church will realize that young people---who leave the church after age 12---are leaving because they believe that the official church is teaching old tales instead of the truth.\n\n\nScripture is neither a history, nor a scientific text.

The Mill Owners had actually petition parliament to send in the navy and break the blockade so the cotton could get through. Quite a lot of mills had the confederate flag flying above them.\n\nThe workers were another story. The suffering, starving former workers of those, now stagnant, mills wrote their OWN petition to parliament insisting that they would refuse to work in the mills if parliament broke the blockade. Demanding not to work with cotton farmed by slaves.

For people who are whining about Merrick Garland, the simple fact is, Obama lack the popular mandate to appoint such a judge. By lacking the popular mandate, I am talking about Congressional control. The Constitution is very clear that the President can appoint someone to the Supreme Court but the Senate have the authority to \"advice and consent\" on that nomination. Ironically, the Constitution doesn't force the Senate to act on that nomination and if they choose NOT to \"advice and consent\", they can do that as they have done so in the past with Republican or Democratic nominees. In general theory, there is no reason to denied Gorsuch his appointment. Even the Democrats acknowledge that he is a superbly qualified but it matter of politics as it always been in the past. Its his stance on issues, not his qualifications that determined the votes. I am sure this will swing both ways, as it always done in the past.",

Teach a child to hunt, to shoot, to fish and you are teaching that child that violence is okay, no different than abusing a child teaches him or her that abuse is okay.  As for so-called \"sport\" hunting goes: As Bill Mahr says, \"is it really a sport if one side doesn't know it's in the game?\"\nThe link between killing animals and killing people is well established. \nPeople are going to whine and complain about traditional values and how hunting and fishing have always been a part of Alaskan \"culture.\"  That doesn't make it morally and/or ethically right.  War has always been a part of the human culture too. It's time we got a clue. Violence begets violence.",

For decades Harp has said Hawaii is not rightfully part of the U.S., and he viciously attacks anyone who disagrees with his secessionist views.  He brags about not paying income tax to the American invaders and occupiers.  So why support federal expansion of federal monument?  1. Federal/Hawaii rules say ethnic Hawaiians get special rights there which no other races can have.  2. When a Hawaiian tribe gets federal recognition the whole monument will be handed over to the tribe.  3. When the world court declares Hawaii is an independent nation, the monument will be part of it.\n\nWhy special racial rights today?  Because natives worshipped  there centuries ago?  But Caucasian and Japanese bones are also on the ocean floor there (World War 2).  So by that logic it's a sacred place for me and my Japanese friends too.  See\nhttp://tinyurl.com/j4o2cdj",

There is no such broad prohibition in international law, only restrictions stipulating that they can't be jailed for life or executed. So, there's nothing inherently improper or illegal about jailing a child combatant and in fact Khadr's incarceration continued upon his return to Canada as a function of the repatriation agreement. That Khadr was subjected to torture raises a separate issue, but I wonder whether Canada had much real influence in this matter as he was a U.S. prisoner. Canada no doubt could have done more to repatriate Khadr but Harper's approach of not being particularly interventionist on behalf of Canadians incarcerated and even sentenced to death by the U.S. justice system was fairly consistently applied.",

Of those 20 million, how many can afford to pay their deductibles, and who pays when they cannot, because they will receive medical care as needed? Answer, the taxpayer pays.",

This propaganda war included having the Department of Finance write an unethical editorial in the January 2016 Fiscal Monitor (something only economic nerds like me reads) explaining how, in the face of year-to-date surplus of $4.3 billion there would be a $3 billion deficit by the end of the year.  Too bad the Public Accounts show that Harper ran surpluses in both 2014-15 and 2015-16.  \nWhen Morneau wasn't running the propaganda war against Harper he tuned the promised $10 billion deficit into a $23 billion deficit and then raised the stakes to a $25 billion deficit.\nThe only bright light is Freeland.",

The tribe's architects no doubt will take this into consideration, and footings will be dug deeper than the fill. They'll probably be safer than the old buildings. Any wave that survives crashing on the hook will likely dissipate a lot of its strength there, but pilings along the shore will still be a good idea to knock down any waves that make it across the harbor.

Attending school and graduating (a requirement to attend prom) was certainly not on their agenda.  Oh, and to hint at the lost prospect of any of them being college bound is ludicrous!   As to the parenting issues you address which include the difficulties and challenges of raising teens?  Please research these parents and their own astonishing number of arrests  before you assume they should join the ranks of parents struggling to raise teens.

But generations since have little work experience or maturity, and their points of reference are whatever feels good. \n\nThe public school systems and parents abdicating their responsibilities have caused this. Years ago I burst in on a Korean programmer having lunch with a Vietnamese programmer. They were laughing about American parents wanting to be their children's best friends. As they explained to me - in their culture the parents are the parents and the children are the children. When the kids become adults, they can be friends with their parents.

Without that, smaller-scale farmers in the area wouldn't be able to keep operating. \n\nI'm sure we can find other ways the big ag corporations help the little ag producers. For example, on Molokai Monsanto (used to) do all the work to keep the Farmers' football field in good condition. They also dug the graves for departed Molokai residents. Also important, for Molokai at least, are the jobs Monsanto provided. Now that they've left, a lot of Molokai families are turning more and more to hunting, foraging, and gathering to feed themselves. This is great, yes, but there are serious doubts about whether Molokai's environment can handle this onslaught. \n\nJust a few positives",

Welcome to the benefits of democratic socialism. Let's contrast that with unrestrained \"capitalism\" using Walmart as an example. According to Forbes in 2014, Walmart's draconian employee practices cost U.S. Taxpayers $6.2 billion per year in public assistance. They add to their bottom line and pass those supposedly \"low-low\" in-store prices onto you by not paying their workers a living wage. We (you and I) make up the difference through social programs like welfare so their workers don't starve. Hmm... seems pretty un-American to me, and like one heck of a scam to me.",

My point was that I think in all fairness it would be nice to see equal space given, either in this story or in a follow-up, to those other local residents who support the measure. You provided a number of quotes from those residents who oppose the ordinance, but I don't recall seeing a story from the meeting earlier this month where a group showed up to testify to the commissioners in support of the ordinance. By giving more newspaper real estate to those who oppose, it appears a bit biased. I want to hear from locals who support the ordinance.",

Since the author of this piece doesn't care to mention any of them, I will mention a few:\n\nThe Papacy's moral silence on the American Civil War.  No Southern Bishop or priest spoke out against the Confederacy before or  during that war.\n\nSouthern churches, particularly in New Orleans, had segregated pews.  Southern Catholic schools  in the region were also segregated.\n\nLoyola University wasn't de-segregated until the 1950s (Bryant Gumbel's father was refused admittance to Loyola because of skin color).\n\nCatholic schools weren't desegregated until 1962.   \n\nWhy?  Resistance of both laity and clergy.",
