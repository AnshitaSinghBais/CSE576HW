The methane that is released is utilized for power generation and to heat the air going back into the mine, they do not use or release any water from the river, but instead engineered a water reclamation system to filter and reuse ground water for all mine activities.

When I was done packing, I saw my 5 year old granddaughter playing so gingerly with one Holy Mary praying ornament.   I thought it is a good chanced tell her about Holy Mary.  So I asked her if she know who she is.\nTo my surprise, she answered \"my mother\".  She didn't like when I say that I am her mother.   I asked her  why she is her mother.   She said \"see grandma, she is praying for everybody!  She is everybody's mother!\"  You know less about Holy Mary then my 5 years old granddaughter!\nHow on earth a retired priest can talk bad mouth about your spiritual mother who is more your mother then your biological mother!",

Within five years, those classes were replaced and more specific visual and auditory learning disabilities (memory & discrimination).  One previous poster mentioned that dyslexia is just one category that is language based.  I agree.  Dyslexia term has not been used in diagnosis or treatment in school systems for a reason.  WISC is the testing application to get an idea about the learning disabilities by someone trained in the testing using WISC ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children).  It was often given before the more expensive/intensive testing over several days by pyschomotrist.  Testing and application have improved over the 1960's misuse of the word Dislexia.",

Sixth, he shot an unarmed man. Seventh, he shot him in the back. Eighth he sustained no injuries.\n\nNo single fact is enough to convict him. Facts six through eight are the most damning. If you want to be authorized to carry a firearm, you must be highly accountable for the actions taken with it. Any hint of impropriety should be viewed through a lens that assumes you acted as such.

He employed thousands of people and created some spectacular buildings in the process rather than sitting on his rump as a passive investor. And by the time this \"analysis\" sets as it's starting point, Trump had already turned his original $14 million loan from his dad into over $1 billion if AP is right. If you calculate his return from the $14 million beginning, assuming the AP is right about his $4 billion net worth, that would be a 28,571% return, albeit over a longer timeframe.

I no longer believe that strategy is appropriate.  This is a very bad man -- a reckless, dangerous man and nothing about being president can cure or contain the evil he seeks to do.

Common law is a very different thing from statutes.  For example, common law is customary judge made law while statutes are legislative acts.\nContract law is also somewhat distinct from Trust law.  Trust law is a better position to argue from in regards to the PFD because contract law requires three elements at the core of any case.  An offer, acceptance and consideration while a trust can be inferred.\nFYI - Consideration is a legal term, different from the common usage in the English language.\nRegardless, contract law really doesn't apply in regards to the PFD.  It was never offered to the Alaskan public.  It was created by Constitutional and legislative process.  Per above, statutes are not contracts in the legal sense, e.g. if a contract conflict with a valid statute (for example violating labor laws) the statute wins.",

What it delivers is a form of legitimacy: if the people vote for it, then however bad it is in the eyes of the best-educated and most-reasoned people(=elite), it's right(=legitimate) to give it to them.  Trump, of course, is the perfect example.  Trump supporters, on average, are considerably less educated than those who voted for Clinton.  But given that our Constitution ultimately grounds political legitimacy in popular choice--even though filtered through institutions like the \"Electoral College\"--the clear difference in information and understanding between the two factions doesn't matter.  Trump is legitimately president.  \n\nSo what?  He still has to be fought at every level, right down to the street. It took him all of a few days to completely destroy our political center.  No matter how legitmate his power, he will pervert and destroy what many generations of Americans have worked and suffered for.",

The 10 years I plan on taking CPP once I retire ( around age 60 ) is a lot of money that I might never get back. Not to mention the loss of potential investment gains over that same period of time.

Many Hawaiians attended Punahou from the start and still do today.  I am no fan of Punahou but fair is fair.  I note that many living out here still are ignorant about the real history of the state.  Incidentally, missionary teachers and their Hawaiian teacher colleagues taught in Hawaiian and English in hundreds of public schools in the 1820's and 1830's.  Missionaries preserved the Hawaiian language, translated it, transliterated it, taught it and worked with Hawaian roayalty to honor it as an official language of the kingdom.

If you are still interested in purchasing oil, why would you not buy ours? Quite simple really. Stop buying oil from anyone in the World and we wont have a market to ship to.

Meanwhile, the Republican elite will blanch at the naked appeals to the alt-right.  Bannon may have broken the GOP more than given it a long term advantage.  Sadly, Clinton played into that push by going back to using abortion to rally female voters rather than continuing the Obama meme that the pro-life movement was a GOP scam (which worked by the way - I was the one who suggested it to NARAL).

Rejecting the Apochrypha is silly, although how we read them is still up to us.

The brutality was rather two-way.)  There aren't, so far as I know, instances of the Hudson's Bay Company or the Northwest Company or their agents in Canada distributing small pox infested blankets. The reason is that fur trading companies depended on aboriginal suppliers for their furs and much else for survival. Killing off your suppliers would be a self-destructive way of doing business.

Since this consciousness is not constant, than there it begins and ends (fads in out). Further, I think we have to distinguish (1) Classical mysticism (the experience of the great mystics) from (2) Mysticism Light (a common experience which is open to all. The difference between the two, is in Classical mysticism, the mystic can not deny and has no doubt about the experience, but with Mysticism Light, discernment is ALWAYS required. That is, under spiritual direction, one must attempt distinguish the activity of (1) the Good Spirit, and (2) the bad spirits, and (3) my own spirit (my own personality, with all of its neuroses and capacity for self-delusion. \n\nSo long as you are not insisting on the continuous action of the Spirit as the first step in denying mystic experience, I agree.",

It creates a problem for all candidates for priesthood. The language of \"intrinsic disorder\" is not just wrong; it represents a dangerous and false understanding of human sexuality that will be troubling for any mature and healthy person contemplating priesthood. To the extent that the 'powers-that-be' intend to implement this directive, to that extent Catholic seminaries will be increasingly unhealthy places; the priesthood itself and the whole People of God will suffer accordingly.

Will Kim feel obliged to conduct an atmospheric test to show that it hasn't?

This, and most other things we do around Christmas time, have absolutely nothing to do with Christianity.\n\nThe injection of Christianity into the winter solstice celebrations has a variety of historical roots, but was mostly done for the sake of convenience.  Christians wanted some day to celebrate the birth of Christ so why not lump in with a day that was already being widely celebrated, hence the selected the (northern hemisphere) winter solstice in the Roman calendar, December 25th.\n\nSo what do we celebrate?

They played the Giants at home, and the Giants had nothing to play for.  Skins win and they're in.  Cousins was awful, and sealed the season with a horrible INT.   The prior season, they won the division and then lost ugly at home to GB. So what do you do with that?! \n\nOn Brees, I don't get why his name keeps popping up.

I was an attendee of an EC parish for almost three years, and no one cared that I was agnostic.  You can believe almost anything you want to and still be part of The EC.  I have had very good EC clergy friends all my life, and they agree; and they also agree that what The EC lacks is strong leadership.  But RC  parishes should copy their love and care for each other.

Coupled that with all of the major auto companies frantically trying to catch up.  Is that going to add to the oil glut or will the oil  companies scale down their production amidst falling prices.  Human nature is odd at times so this is a challenging question.\n\nHave always wondered if the  Saudis will open the spigots for another brutal round of price breaking deals.  No body seems to mention that possibility.  If that happens, coupled with the onslaught of EVs it could prove to be an interesting few years.\n\nOne last point, now that China has brought downthe price  solar panels, if  they can be retrofitted to my house then I can charge my Tesla naturally.

A businessman's logic doesn't say, \"China evil, we will bury them.\" Rather, it notes what his business needs and explores how to get there.

New York was well known for its violence, ethnic and other, as was L.A., yet the violence depicted in West Side Story for example was mild compared to what happens today, even in  Canada.

For the parts were formed within her when she was still a fetus, but could not [develop] because of the defect in the heat emerge and project on the outside, and this, though making the animal itself that was being formed less perfect than one that is complete in all respects, provided no small advantage for the race; for there needs must be female.

We have seen examples of exactly that on both highways in the vicinity of, but outside, Anchorage at least once this year already.  \n\nI can remember one accident investigation (not the accident itself) on the inbound Glenn earlier this year that had traffic gridlocked for over six hours, with a number of those drivers meanwhile having run out of gas and further complicating the situation.

The proposed LNG plant would cost $9 to $11-billion.  Petronas said it could not afford 7% B.C. tax on export profits AFTER recouping development costs. It wanted tax concessions including a 30% capital cost allowance.  The Canadian Assoc'n of Petroleum Producers agreed with such concessions, saying it allowed companies to write off 90% of their investments within 7 years. Can anyone imagine the fed'l or prov'l governments writing off their 'investments' (debts or deficits) within 7 years?? Too many subsidies!",

I wondered if Harkin wanted government to take more control of another major part of the economy.\n\nI wonder if the second paragraph of this story is something Harkin was thinking about. Create a tax on homes at a determined value and then take the revenue from that tax to help others buy a home - and maybe people who know they can't afford a mortgage. Isn't that what really caused the recession in 2008? Banks were giving mortgages to people who knew they couldn't pay it back? The banks rolled the dice hard for the revenue on the interest.

A similar house in Victoria, within a twenty minute walking distance to the downtown core, is $800,000.00 or even a bit less.(with twice the lot size).  People in Vancouver can move to Victoria and still stuff two million dollars into their bank account. This is missed by most people because of such poor reporting. Victoria people themselves don't even realize how much their homes are going to rise this year because they don't understand how much more Vancouver \"core prices\" are.  To sell now in Victoria would be a mistake because you are probably leaving at least two hundred thousand dollars on the table. (Tax free as well.)",

Magnolians can help move toward this goal by supporting the development of affordable housing at Fort Lawton. In the meantime, however, it is obvious that there is not enough affordable shelter in Seattle. Saying that people should not stay in tent encampments more than 180 days is not realistic, since there is nowhere else to go. The tent city provides a sense of community and stability that can help people find jobs and a support system. Can you imagine having to move every 90 days? Even worse, can you imagine not knowing each night where you would spend the night? The stress must be unthinkable.\n\nAs for Emerson St, I am a bike commuter and rode often through that encampment.

There is also the 80/20 principle as 80% of demand is for low rise but the supply is only 20%  so there is more demand for this type of housing that results in bidding wars. We need more supply but we cannot build them fast enough.

I think it would be more accurate to state that the chalk commentary was their response to the group. \n\nThe other issue is that the vote was 8 to 4.  It should have been 12 to 0. \nYou may not agree with what the Catholic group was saying, but you should at least be willing to allow them to say it and then discuss why you think its wrong.",

This sounds dubious to me as she will be unable to do anything of substance with the House in the hands of the looney Republicans.  It seems therefore that she is just playing a game where she can say, \"We tried to tackle immigration reform but it didn't work\"--this would be a sell-out for all the immigrants in limbo. I hope she doesn't make mistakes like Obama did--going for healthcare reform instead of making sure that Dems drew the congressional districts by winning the mid-term elections. Dems really dropped the ball by not showing up in that mid-term election--what a bunch of idiot losers all those stay at home Dems are. Now we're f*cked until the 2020 reapportionment.",

Tech giants like Facebook and YouTube make huge amounts of money on our information and content and sell access to our information, but currently have no responsibilities for it's privacy and the quality of information like newspapers.  Thus fake news and massive targeted lies. How can this be? Facebook uses the Napster defense \"we are just a platform \" or a \"device\". Napster  got sued into the ground by violating copyright.  How is it that they can facilitate spreading child pornography and not be held accountable? Or disseminate targeted lies to people's  \" news\"feeds to distort elections for rubles,  such as what happened in US election,  but then pretend they don't know or can't do anything? \nThere needs to be serious legislation on this. Tech companies cannot be trusted to do the right thing when money is involved. Transparency as a response is pathetic.",

Yet these same communities,  and Sheema Khan, are looking at the actions of one extreme individual in the secular community and generalizing to the whole group. Canadians are no more racist than Muslims are terrorist.\nOur society is already inclusive. And if many of us feel we have \"Canadian values\" they are certainly not based on a \"deep mistrust of Muslims in Canada.\" They are based on the values of tolerance, freedom and respect for the rule of Canadian law. If there are conflicts with the philosophy of Islam, it is mostly because of the latter, where Sharia law conflicts with the laws of Canada.

It's not like it's just demand for a place to live. It is speculative demand, facilitated in part by the ever-expanding record high levels of household debt. It is demand for a safe haven for foreign capital (coupled with citizenship/ residency of convenience). \n\nIt's a crude assessment, but if you take the Lower Mainland's pop. growth numbers and the # of units being built, more than enough supply for shelter is being built.\n\nReal estate has grown to >1/4 of BC's GDP, bigger than forestry, mining, and other sectors COMBINED. Completely ignoring knock-on effects (e.g. bleeding young talent that represents essential skills and the future tax base) while advocating further pumping of this single bloated sector is just nakedly self-serving.",

One carried Alberta natural gas (north of Lake Superior) and the other (Enbridge, south of Lake Superior) carries crude oil. All of Canada west of the Ottawa river which includes Ontario were obligated to use Alberta petroleum.\n\nThe Arab oil cartel artificially inflated the price of crude in the mid 70s, eventually to $30 from $3, and a world recession ensued. The substitute for the NOP, the new NEP, was intended to partially shield Canadians from the artificially inflated Arab cartel price.  Alberta felt it was it's right to have the cartel equivalent from Canadians, and so today Ontario buys oil on the world market (St Lawrence Seaway).",

There IS. In fact that is precisely why God created marriage and made it a Sacrament. Precisely BECAUSE the relationship between a husband and a wife, (male and female) is something in the created, material sphere that reveals something of the unseen spiritual word and the manner in which God loves the Church and relates to the Church. \n\nIt is, in part, due to this imagery that we cannot ordain women. The priest represents the bridegroom, to the bride, the Church.  If we have women priests, the imagery becomes homosexual--and God does not relate to the Church in that way.",

This all took place just as the population bubble of Baby Boomers reached those years.  \n\nIn terms of the Church, I think that it was the real or perceived lack of fulfillment of Vatican II, whether it be greater roles for lay people or greater roles for priests plus Humanae Vitae that contributed to the drop in vocations.",

My point on weather models is simply that you have the opportunity to test predictions on a frequent basis.  I'd think that would help to improve those models over time.  \n\nOn uncertainty in the models, it would be interesting to see the magnitude of the potential error of other variables vs. the magnitude of the effect we're attributing to CO2.  Not sure if Patrick Frank is close or way off on that one.\n\nThe radiative effects of CO2 are actually growing logarithmically rather than exponentially, aren't they?  i.e., theoretically you get the same warming effect (~1.2 deg C) from a doubling of the concentration, whether that's from 300 to 600ppm or 600 to 1200ppm.",

In retrospect, the track record for the decisions in which I participated was mixed, but where we failed I think the main attribute we discounted was experience. I can't speak to the issue of lack of Canadian experience per se, but I suspect that in a market featuring labour surpluses it's mainly used as a deselection criterion. As it turns out, studies have shown that human beings aren't particularly adept at making objective hiring decisions and I can attest to that. Skills testing is considered a more accurate assessment mechanism than evaluating resumes and/or conducting interviews, but where \"intangible\" qualities like character and leadership skills are important I believe it's important to consider verifiable experience although I understand this could well put new immigrants at an unfair disadvantage.",

In Toronto, one school started having prayer at school because the students would go to the mosque and then not go back to school afterwards. The school itself brought up the idea so that the students wouldn't skip out. You seem to be claiming that it's the parents who are doing this in order to force their kids to pray. Is another example of your fear of Muslims coming out? I doubt that the school is forcing the students to attend or reporting back to the parents f they don't.",

Yes, it takes special training and a person with special skills and attitudes to be a deacon/priest - but God does not put some special mark on them.  It is their devotion to God and faith and the support of those they love and serve that creates whatever mark there is on their souls.\n\nAnd this thing about deacons/priests \"extending the blessing of the bishop\" goes a bit far, too, doesn't it?  Another attempt at creating human demi-gods, oh, one step up the ladder higher than the plain old priests.  Bishops have some special relationship to God and get to extend the blessings from God down through the priests? Is God's love only channeled through them or does it fall like dew and sunshine?",

(I imagine he would think that he would think the same of the U.S. church).\nArinze and his like-minded colleagues in the Roman Curia should be using their energies in addressing the catastrophic effect of the clerical abuse crisis. Instead they worry about liturgical dancers, and, in Arinze's case, whether or not to kneel at Communion. Talk about fiddling while Rome burns!",

No more deacon jerk-around stalling tactics for female human dignity.  \n\nYouth want us to stop treating LGBT like they have a contagious disease or any disease.  \n\nYouth are not fond of clericalism so lets put laity on the altar more, not less, alongside our ordained folks, in the future, so they can read even Gospel readings & give qualified homilies sometimes. Dump the permanent deaconate so there is no needlessly ordained men or women standing in the way of lay ministry, so interested lay people can do the allowable sacraments like baptism s etc. sometimes.",

So today, as always, we have employment. But the key is the market-clearing wage. We observe two things:\n\n1. A long-run increased income disparity, driven mostly by a long-run increase in the disparity in factors explaining various wage rates;\n\n2.  A long-run decrease in the wage/nominal-GDP ratio. I.e., the wage bill as a percentage of the value of production is declining.\n\nBoth of these phenomena are interrelated, but the reality of machines replacing humans will worsen these trends. -- David Murrell, Economics, UNB t Fredericton",

I am sick GG got elected, but never thought Rob Quist was the right candidate to run against him.  In the end, I'm just glad the whole freaking thing is over...and no, you can not convince Trump's true believers that they are voting to slit their own throats.  They do not believe they really will lose their health insurance, or medicaid, or social security because 'it will never happen'.",

Some may be, but let's step into the real world and visit a not-quite suburb of Denver, namely Elbert County.\n\nTotally Repub dominated, to the point that I haven't seen a Dem win a single election in almost 20 years.  Virtually every tax increase ballot issue is defeated also, even those that are needed.  \nCounty books are open, just no money there since the taxes are so low.  It's to the ridiculous point of applying paper thin asphalt patches on the worst sections of highly travelled roads instead of giving them the maintenance they need - and that's on top of 10 years of chip seal to patch potholes and cracks.\n\nNot all are awash in money, and I'd bet that many semi-rural & rural counties are in the same boat.  I support Tabor, but also support tax increases when truly justified instead of just having the knee jerk reaction of \"heck no!\".",

Many times I have seen someone who disagreed on a doctrinal issue become part of the church because they were first welcomed into the fellowship and as they became integrated into the social network of the church they were drawn closer to God in ways that whittled-away at their opposition until it disappeared. If we're socially repulsive, it doesn't matter how correct we are on doctrine because we'll just be driving people away from God. What is there about your relationships with others, about the social programs and ministries and fellowship of your church that will draw people to God with greater power than what is driving them away?",

There is no shared trauma. Indeed almost no shared anything. And that means people only talk to people who see the world like they do. Vietnam was different. However you responded to being drafted, you were linked to others who might responded differently. Right or wrong it was everyone's war.
