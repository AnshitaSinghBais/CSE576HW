We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California. I don’t understand it,” she said, dismissing calls to drop out.\n\nObama campaign spokesman Bill Burton rebuked Clinton, saying her remark was “unfortunate and has no place in this campaign.”\n\nAny comments about assassination and the primary contest are especially sensitive because Obama is the first African-American to advance so far in the race for the White House and he has faced threats, congressional sources have said.\n\nClinton later apologized (or, more precisely, expressed “regret” that people had taken offense).\"\n\nNew York Post May 24, 2008",

The business community reacts, gets interested. And then if you add some tax breaks, that will increase the marginal spending but it won’t make them do what they wouldn’t have done anyway. So that’s [why we need] additionality, getting firms to do what they would not have done anyway. In countries like Canada, there is too much reliance on indirect tax breaks that just make the companies richer. The point of policy is not to increase profits, it’s to increase investments.\"\n\nThis argument is grounded in the real world.",

As the host population (America) becomes familiarized with what they're told are the requirements of Islamic piety, demands are made for segregation at public facilities, the workplace, schools and universities. Requests for halal food, sha'riah compliant financial transactions and addition of Muslim holidays to public calendars further elevate the Muslim community with a special status, making them separate and distinct from all other groups and persons.\n\nAll demands are initially presented as benign attempts to accommodate the religious requirements of devout Muslims. In the USA, requests for separate swimming and gym hours for Muslim men and women, demands for ID photos with women wearing hijabs, and refusal to handle pork products have appeared.  The goal is to get the host societies accustomed to Muslim customs, holidays, dress, and food.\n\nGoogle \"americanthinker hijra\"",

See this link for greater detail:\n\nhttp://sustainablesociety.com/population/aging#.WL1a1_IUhtA\n\nImmigration won't support the level of social services because the immigrant stream is tax negative.  You can't maintain a healthy social safety net or support an aging population on the backs of a growing pool of working poor.\n\nThe only thing that can solve our problems is an increase in job quality.

The statues were not erected in honor of the failed traitors, but in honor of fighting for the racist \"values\" the KKK and their supporters held in common with the Confederacy. When the hood crew lost their popular support, the wave of Confederate statues petered out. \n.\nAnd the statues were not \"ignored until last weekend\" as you put it.

He's completely regressed as he's aged, completely opposite of what's expected of a veteran. And I've said for a WHILE that he's literally THE LAST position player I want coming to the plate w/the game on the line. \nCLEARLY, Story took offense at my comment, and is trying to wrest that title from him. \nI wish there was a stat for the distance between the bat and the ball during clutch situation whiffs. I'm joking... kinda. But if they actually HAD such a stat, Cargo'd be among the league leaders. Be it sliders or curves off of the plate, or fastballs up around his shoulders, he misses by a LOT.\nHe's a great guy, he's awesome in the locker room/dugout, and having a bilingual veteran leader in today's MLB sure can't hurt.

However, I do think saying that prosecution is not recommended falls under the finding that no criminal act occurred. If I understand Comey correctly, it seems he and his panel did not find that there was any intent involved and, for them, that is what separates it from a criminal act. Apparently he sees a distinction between \"extreme negligence\" and \"gross negligence\" that many others do not.  \n\nThe issue is that, not just Comey, but the FBI panel that reviewed the issue unanimously agreed that it did not meet the definition you have quoted. So, the question you are asking should go to him and the panel that reviewed the situation (reopening the investigation may be that they are having second thoughts).  \n\nI understand the seriousness of this issue. I also understand that how one sees it will, very likely, fall under partisan lines. \n\nRespectfully,\nJohn David",

It is probably fairly miraculous that so many families actually survive the process of parenting.\nIn some the Mom turns out to be the rock that holds it together, in some its the Dad. If the children are really lucky they see both parents as equal contributors to a happy and balanced childhood where, however unequal the division of household chores may appear to be, the main anti-Dad point in McDonald's piece, both parents are grown up enough to make parenting about the whole family and not just about martyred feminists like McDonald.

The reality is that such a radiant greenhouse effect has not been observed anywhere in th solar system including the Earth.  As derived from first principals, the surface of the Earth is on average 33 degrees C warmer than it would be otherwise because of a convective greenhouse effect caused by gravity, the heat capacity of the atmosphere and the depth of the troposphere.  33 degrees C is the amount of warming derived from first principals and 33 degrees C is what has been observed.

A modest taxation adjustment on mining, commercial fishing and corporations will yield enough revenue to close the budget gap.

Most of those people you speak of aren't killing themselves - problems aside, most of them value their lives.",

From the many Catholic articles that I’ve been reading of late, I’m failing to locate a shred of love.

Amoris Laetitia, I suppose it could mean a ‘ flat white or lovely latte’.  But no, more importantly, it pertains to ‘Love’ and not only ‘Love’ but the JOY, yes, the JOY of LOVE.  I truly understand the ‘Infantilization of laity’. So, what is so wrong with saying, ‘The Joy of Love’? The power games of our ‘politically correct’ talk is all too cold, and it leaves no room for meeting the other in Christ’s love. Break barriers, build bridges and live the Joy of Love.",

It is frightening  because he truly has no coherent policy.  Recall that just a week ago his administration thought intervention in Syria was \"silly.\"  In the space of a few days he has completely flipped.  He has flipped on nearly every election promise he ever made and in some cases flipped back again.

I was abused as a child and I did everything right, went to church, believed in God, got top grades - I was the child that other adults said they wished their kids could be like. After the abuse, it changed my life. If I did all the right things and was such a good person then why did such horrible stuff have to happen to me??!! It only made the aftermath of the abuse that more traumatizing. I decided, that from then on, I would make my own choices, and good bad or ugly, no one was going to tell me what to do again - sounds like this was exactly her thinking too. By the grace of God I got my shit together and people that know me today would never guess my past. I'm an example of a successful survivor, but Brianna will never have that chance because someone brutally murdered her. Someone abused her - this time they killed her.  This young woman had her whole life ahead of her. She should still be alive.",

Levesque was in his room getting drunk with his staff. He was an alcoholic and could stay not sober, even for such important work. He assumed everybody else went to bed. Late the next morning when he showed up hung over, he found out the premiers had come to an agreement without him and was felt he had been betrayed. He called it the \"Night of the Long Knives” and we are still dealing with the fallout. He believed then that everything should stop and wait for him, and Quebec today still has the same sense of entitlement.",

The religious at least acknowledge they cannot prove their beliefs by scientific methods, which are not designed or intended to deal with philosophical constructs.

Then add to this the additional cap and trade increase that took effect in January (about an 8% increase, and you are left with an overall increase about 2%+8% = 10%. Now they are talking about changing amortization to reduce the bill by 15%. The net effect, the savings are just +10% - 15% = 5%. Yet they are marketing this as a 25% reduction.

Alien? Or just highly advanced terrestrial technology that our government won't admit to? I don't know.

It argues for allowing opinion, even on a hot topic.   (Especially on a hot topic, I'd say.)  \"Cultural appropriation: Why can't we debate it?\" she asks.  Well, the 253 comments before this one have been doing exactly that, so I guess that's her question answered.  But is anybody in this thread going to lose their job because of the views expressed here?  Not if their name is Retrofit, apparently.  So, why are people losing their jobs over this?  Because a smallish group of angry people disagree with their opinion?  Were Niedzvieki, Kay and Ladurantaye guilty of hate speech?  Is that why they lost their jobs?  No?  Then why did they lose their jobs over being part of a debate?  I support Renzetti's take on this.\n\nPart Two: The Thorny Question\n\nWhat do you think of Shakespeare's Richard III,  Orwell's 1984, and Twain's Huckleberry Finn?

There are TWO really big pieces that create the bridge that allows us to be human.  The first is that we listen and learn from others.  The second, is that if we've not personally had the experience, even as we learn, we still hold those who HAVE had that experience with deference FOR that experience/wisdom.  Yes, i know that a formal education is a means to share some of that experience, and to become an \"expert.\"  But all it can do is share the experience: not the wisdom, nor respect.\n\nTHIS is where the bishops got in trouble.

These mass-shootings are inevitable in a society full of guns.

But over the 24 years, the return on investment in real estate in Vancouver has averaged about 6% a year, which is no different from the return that could have been collected from other investments. In conclusion the present situation of very fast increases will probably not last, a few people will make a lot of money and many more will lose or be disappointed with the returns.",

Tell them it's too much and what do they do? - hire a new manager (plus assistant and support staff) to see how patient care can be cut back further without touching the holy admin budget.\nI can't defend doctors who double-dip where it is expressly forbidden by law, but while that's a crime, preventing it won't make a difference to health care funding issues; there's far more money being wasted on self-serving managers.",

However, presenting them in the garb and customs of the \"Old Order\" Mennonites who settled in Ontario and the eastern parts of the U.S. from the Swiss-South German regions of Europe beginning in the late 18th C. is to completely garble the story and the history of the respective peoples. Ethnically, they are different people. Linguistically, they speak different dialects of German. Of course, the producers may not care about authenticity at all, and felt that the audience would be disappointed at the relatively normal appearance of the Mexican Mennonites so they went for the more quaint Old Order look. People might want to watch this series, but they should do so understanding it is entertainment, not an accurate presentation of events or peoples.",

As bad if not worse than oil, just that oil is on a larger scale today. China has a huge environmental problem they are creating as they are the world's number one suppliers.\n\n\n I cringe every time I see a Prius or hybrid car with these in it. China actually tried to blackmail Japan withholding shipments. It's not just the cars, but cellphones and all kind of high-tech things! It's the new environmental nightmare being the byproduct of the new technology world, one that will have great impact on the environment.

This insurance proposal would be self regulating, a concept lost on the very stupid.  The insurance companies would simply start to deny policies to those who lie about being in compliance with the law.  Business people are rational, loosing a house or condo investment no longer becomes a good return if it can be easily taken away by a law suit.

He's not doing that.  The law applies generally, to all.  What Francis is looking to do is cultivate fulfillment of the law.  That's hard to do, but the discernment process can go in that direction if conscience connects up to God's law \"written on the human heart\".  \n\nFrancis said what he wanted in \"Amoris Laetitia\".  What the four cardinals call \"doubt and confusion\" is neither.  You don't have discernment if the results of every discernment have to be rationalized as law.  The role of the pastor is to help conscience connect to Christ, not to conform conscience to the law.",

Don't people know that in a car collision, a small dog will go flying like a miniature missile? It's this reason precisely that dogs should be secured with doggie seats. So what if it's not required by law. It's required by logic. I've seen people driving with their dogs on their lap. I also don't understand how the spilling of the tea could have gotten so out of hand (no pun intended). If you're handed a hot cup, you'll feel it's hot, and if it's too hot you calmly put it in your car's cup holder. Sounds like this woman never had to handle unexpected stress before and just plain freaked out. Kind of like a deer freezing in the road as headlights approach it, not knowing the sensible thing to do. Put the damn cup down instead of panicking and shaking the tea all over the place. I hope these factors come up in court. This harebrain isn't the first to be handed a cup that's \"too hot.\"",

In many ways, England's age as a culture (compared to ours) is part of their great charm and attraction, not only for Americans but also for Asians. Witness recent Asian fascination with \"Downton Abbey\" and the sudden increase in newly-affluent Chinese seeking butlers. If the great English cathedrals were allowed to fall into ruin there would still be other ancient monuments to see but the loss of these buildings would reflect badly not only on the state of the Anglican church which as everyone knows is moribund anyway, but also on England itself, and that's not good.

The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks.

Drew Brees was considered a bust prior to his breakout season in 2004 (his fourth NFL season). It's way to early to call either Siemian or Lynch anything other than works in progress. \n\nI hope Siemian emerges this year as the answer at QB.

To abandon a child like that and leave the student locked outside and unprotected during an emergency, would seem to be totally reckless and irresponsible behavior.

You're correct that most physicians aren't specifically trained in pharmacology.  However, they ARE highly trained professionals in whatever field they select, including the field of pain management.   Including a 4 year undergraduate degree, which is required by the federal government, it takes 8 years to become a pharmacist. Depending on the speciality and including undergraduate requirements,  physicians can take up 15 years or longer to become an M.D.  \nI certainly won't argue that there are some bad apples out there but the majority of pain specialists are legitimate and serve a legitimate patient population.  I don't countenance witch hunts and that is my concern with all the finger pointing going on these days.

Islamic State is putting up a fierce resistance. UN reports state that the Iraq army lost 2000 soldiers last month in the battle. No doubt Islamic State has lost a lot of fighters too. Nevertheless, the intensity of the battle for Mosul appears to be far greater than that for Aleppo. That will surely mean that civilian losses are likewise greater.\n\nTo put it in context, the battle for Aleppo took the lives of about 500 fighters on BOTH sides over the last month. If Iraq did indeed lose 2000 soldiers in Mosul over the same period, it's reasonable to assume that civilians losses are at least four times as high as well.",

This 15% rate would make sense for those of us who are small business owners, who need the tax relief.  So, if you are a small business owner struggling to grow your business and are currently taxed at 25% or even 28%, that makes good sense.  \n\nHowever, if this 15% rate on flow through income is allowed for those already wealthy persons who would be at the proposed top tax bracket of 35%, that amounts to a 20% reduction in tax rate (35% - 15% = 20%) on that income.  \n\nWhy do the wealthiest Americans need such a large tax break in the first place?  And believe it, the wealthy do get substantial amounts of flow through income.  Btw, the current tax plan gives the wealthiest Americans even more tax breaks.  Who pays for all of that, anyway?",

Those holidays happen early enough in the school year that there is no way I wouldn't be able to make up the work, but since the teacher had scheduled a test for that day, with no way to make it up, I was out of luck as far as he was concerned.  Thankfully, my parents are both incredibly pushy and managed to make most of the problems go away without resorting to suing.\n\nAs for the Christmas songs, I would have been fine if they had been the secular Rudolph and Santa type songs, but not full on religious ones.",

We really need to be philosophically consistent in making these judgments. I think the white nationalist movement is a misguided reaction to circumstances that are more accurately addressed in the context of growing economic inequality and underlying class warfare. Poor whites in the U.S. likely have much more in common with poor blacks and Hispanics than many want to admit.

I watched the documentary, Earthlings (YouTube, NationEarth), which exposes the domination of humans over innocent, sentient animals. Please consider veganism over \"better animal welfare.\" Check out Dr. Michael Greger's book, \"How Not to Die\"  or listen to his famous speech  \"The Leading Causes of Death\" (YouTube) to learn why ALL animal products are bad for our health in so many ways (even fish, eggs, chicken).  For those of you who think you need animal protein, may I suggest a google search of vegan body builders and Olympic athletes?

So many of us have felt that the church doesn't do 1/8 of what it needs to do for ADULTS [and not just parents of growing children].  Does your parish even have any adult discussion groups?  Would you be up to starting one---for your parish or/and including neighboring parishes?  Take a few [not too many] topics from your book CHURCH CHAT: SNAPSHOTS OF A CHANGING CHURCH and offer them as discussion [try Lent---great time to offer courses---six weeks is great to whet the spiritual appetite].\nMaybe go into Vatican II and discuss 'some of those changes'.  \n\nYou will find others from your parish/greater parish area who also have questions and want to discuss.  This will give you support as you give support to others.  With your background, the parish should have no problems sponsoring this as part of Adult Spiritual Growth.  Good luck and God bless you---keeping you in prayer.",

Well, he has a gay daughter.  He was forced to empathize....to see things from other's perspective.\n\nCallahan's excuses are also typical.

Clearly not. I'll give the agent credit for working his contacts but all of his sales were to Asian families and this agent was not Asian. But he does advertise in Asian newspapers. Some people are lucky because of circumstances. It's been this way in Mississauga for 35 years. Used to be the fastest growing city in Canada.

Imagine special classes for most 26 year olds in AP/STEM class environments. Have you met AP kids as adults and they can't abstract?

Increased trade has increased the general total wealth of the world's people, it's just the the folks at the highest income levels have benefited the most.  China has a new middle class they did not have three decades ago.  Our leadership has allowed the folks who benefited the most from this increase of wealth of China's middle class to affect our middle class.  We have cut taxes on the top, we have eliminated required retraining of workers put out of jobs, etc. due to the policies of the GOP.  Less taxes, less government.  Leave the market to the private sector.  The market has done well, the rich have done well with trade, it's just the fools who do not understand \"trickle down economics\" that have been hurt.  Go ahead fool, give Trump a shot at making this wealth gap bigger.",

The assumption being that the government lawyers felt that they would lose, however they could not know what the judge would decide in terms of the amount. Choosing to pay seems to be the biggest sticking point for many, and if the government had fought and lost, it would have been an easier sell.As for the apology, the whole apology business has gotten way out of hand. By not fighting the case any longer and settling with such a large amount should be apology enough.

The US has almost 50mil citizens in rural areas. That's 2x the entire population of Australia and more than 5x the Swiss pop. What this means is that you have a very large number of Americans who use guns as an everyday tool and view the rights of gun ownership as sacrosanct.

The sequestration concept is one that gets ignored when people look at only a very short term release. To compare the carbon input of lighting or fossil fuel that has been sequestered for millions of years to the short term ups and down that are measured in days to decades of agricultural activities is misleading.  When the long term sequestered products are added to the normal biological actives is where problems come in.\nThe ecological impact is also not accounted for.  The ecological impact of cutting rainforest for grazing is large but the replacement of grazers is small and may be positive in terms of ecology.  Many square miles of monoculture beans or oats is harmful to the environment so grass feed beef is better than feel lot beef but it may also be better for the environment than people consuming beans and oats from massive monoculture.",

Many believe it would be constitutional because it does NOT impose a qualification over and above the federal government, but merely requires the provision readily and easily providable information. The Supreme Court case that is always cited, \"U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton\" DID add an actual qualification to be on the ballot: candidates could not have served more than three or more terms in Congress. The release of tax returns makes no requirement as to what the returns show; that judgement would be up to the individual voter. Not surprisingly, conservative-leaning experts believe this would still be unconstitutional and a liberal-leaning experts believe it would be perfectly constitutional. We may get to see what the Supreme Court thinks at some point.",

You show up at the ER with severe shortness of breath caused by your lung cancer. The  ER staff has to screen you for an emergency medical condition and can't delay the screening while asking how you're going to pay. Severe dyspnea is an emergency, so the ER staff would likely treat you with several medications. They may do imaging and admit you if you're still significantly laboring to breath. You might even get a chemo or radiation treatment or two. But, as soon as you are you are stable, the hospital can and likely will discharge you. \n\nNo one has an obligation to further treat you until you are again in severe distress. \n\nPlus, you remain liable under normal civil law for the cost of your treatment. The hospital can and likely will bill you and pursue collection.",
