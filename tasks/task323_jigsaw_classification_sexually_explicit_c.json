A true and serious policy would certainly have been the subject of speeches, etc.  The platforms published on web pages are routinely ignored.  Politifact uses empty web page rhetoric to call Trump a liar.  That is blatant bias.  Also, a number of citations to Clinton's campaign jumping on the birther movement were given on these pages in response to other stories.  Politifact apparently ignores such references appearing to suggest that the Clinton campaign never touched the birther issue.  Given the citations, that conclusion seems somewhat questionable (i.e. steeped in bias).",

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

So the Elway deal didn't violate Kaiser's rights after all, the way it was structured. \n\nHowever, I've never found what the end result was - did Elway get a 10% share of the team after they won the appeal? Maybe he already does. Doesn't seem like Pat would pull the deal off the table after fighting it in court with Kaiser. This would be a good subject for follow-up by an ambitious news reporter.",

That starts right at the top of the pile & trickles all the way down to the local level. Case in hand would be the crooked officials that collect per diem when they live in Juneau or when they state that they're in session but are not at all. Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks. Why can't you just get off your fat lazy butt & take the time to deliver it to the office rather then use an unnecessary service. Waste!",

This MOU was renewed 2006. Natural diversity does not include chasing and shotgunning bears and wolves  in helicopters by ADFG biologists-assassins, nor permitting private pilots in fixed wing to do likewise.  Natural diversity is out the window if these actions are allowed to continue. The perversity of this wildlife holocaust is so out of control, a hapless commissioner cannot even recognize the egregious character and actions of its enablers.  The only fault in the newly proposed action that hopefully restores the original intent of the refuges is that the USFWS waited way too long, 36 years since the passage of ANILCA, to take reasonable and corrective action.",

ALL our wars since WW2 have been, hence, illegal, and therefore crimes, and any soldier who participated in them is a war criminal, by definition.  \nMost military types are too brainwashed to admit that to themselves. They rely on the old defense: \"I vas only followink orders,\" but that got Germans hung at Nuremburg. Do our troops have less responsibility to disobey illegal orders? I wish all troops were as good as Smedley Butler.",

The Chinese dominated Vietnam for over a century, as they now dominate Tibet. Arabs, Berbers, and Turks dominated much of southern Europe for centuries.

Section 501 (c) (4) of the IRS code exempts certain types of non-profit organizations from federal income taxes.  The statute requires civic organizations to be \"operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare\".  The IRS has traditionally used a more lenient interpretation of the statute that such organizations be involved \"primarily\" (rather than exclusively) in social welfare - which has allowed \"social welfare\" organizations to engage in lobbying and campaign activities \"as long as those activities are not their primary activity.\"  In the wake of the formation of the Tea Party, a raft of \"social welfare\" organizations sought tax free status which appeared to actually be political organizations - not social welfare.  The IRS investigated these organizations to insure that they were, in fact, \"primarily\" involved in social welfare. - in other words, they were doing their jobs.",

Life isn't a porn fantasy where 20 year old women enter the first cab they see with a 40 year old cabbie, tell him to rip off her pants (her pants were inside out in the manner that occurs when someone pulls off another's pants) so they can have sex, pissss herself and then have at it and be done (her DNA on his lip, him trying to stuff her wet pants and underwear into the console, etc.) and pass out all within 11 minutes (including him driving her nowhere near her home).\n\nYour point about stupefaction ignores the reality that the more you drink the less you are able to make good judgments about much, including drinking.  That comment you made is blaming her for being drunk.  People have a right to be drunk if they want (or even naked) and no one, NO ONE has the right to use this as an excuse to rape them!\n\nRead Blatchford's take on this.

I suspect Yost will have the same effect on the QBs. Couple that with the recruiting vision and the difference between the Frost years and what we have coming is going to be major - and in a very positive direction.\n\nSide note: the comments from the other assistants about the organization & communication under Lubick versus when Frost was \"in charge\" speaks volumes, too. It's not always the case; but, I feel that Frost getting the UCF job is going to truly be an \"addition by subtraction\" scenario for our coaching staff.

It would prevent pregnancy in the first place. Only when she knows that her mate will stick around and support her that it is OK to become pregnant.\n\nAs for promiscuity, well, humans have been promiscuous for millions of years because it is in our genes that we have sex as often as we can in order to produce offsprings. That is why sex is very pleasurable - to encourage us to do it often. Sure, many people have the self-control to resist their desire for the pleasure but there are many who give in to it or are in danger of rape so they should have access to birth control just in case.",

Pope Francis prevented that from ever happening.>\nI think Pope Benedict gets some credit for that. Chicago wasn't open when Benedict removed Burke from St. Louis, but by removing him to Rome, Benedict pretty much assured that Burke would not be a diocesan bishop again. The move to the Signatura was widely seen as an instance of the ancient Roman practice known as \"Promoveatur ut amoveatur\" (Let him be promoted in order to remove him.) Of course, Francis could appoint Burke to a diocese (he could have appointed him to Chicago in 2014), but I don't think he will. If Francis could find a bishop willing to have him, perhaps Francis will assign Burke as an auxiliary bishop. He would be the second cardinal so assigned.",

This levy is simply a renewal of that one, and is neither a new tax nor a 39% hike; mathematically it will cause little, if any, increase to what folks pay now.  It's not a new tax.  The levy funds are 22% of the district's budget, and this number is not being increased.  The levy pays for shop and vocational programs, athletics, counselors, smaller class sizes, much of our amazing music program, and a large portion of maintenance.  To lose it would be a major blow to our economy and our ability to recruit both new businesses and good teachers.  Our business and medical community are urgently asking the community to renew it.",

Hawai`i used to be able to do great things and lead, but now that's over.  We can tinker on the edges, but we're currently relegated largely to just managing state owned assets for the benefit of rich folks and corporations.\n\nIMHO, the left needs to focus on voter owned elections, because this is the change that makes all the other changes possible.

Actually, legally it may have been. But I don't think of it as a crime. Women used to experience this kind of stuff all the time.

No, this is normative developmental and universal sexual behavior.  And by universal I that means that it is practiced by all human beings at one time or another in their lives.  And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

In the mid 19th century there was a pecking order of which immigrants were the most desirable, beginning with British and Americans only. In the late 19th century, British and Americans were preferred, followed by northern and western Europeans, central and eastern Europeans and then by Jews and southern Europeans. Religious sects such as Hutterites and Mennonites or Doukhobors were less wanted and Asians and Blacks were almost unacceptable. People displaced by WWII were seen as dirty DP's who were bringing crime to Canada.\nThe truth of the matter is that the majority of immigrants became great citizens of Canada despite the fears of the \"old stock\" Canadians. When will the ignorance and misinformation stop? There should be a place in Canada for people seeking refuge and a new life despite the ranting of the ignorant.",

Problems the taxi companies have had every power to address themselves but simply rely on regulation to avoid modernization.\n\nI've never used Uber or Lyft but I have used Grab in South East Asia. \"Grab Car\" is like Uber in that a price is quoted up front, \"Grab Taxi\" is just a way to hail a cab with your smartphone, with the added benefit of a digital record of your transaction and an estimated up-front fare (you also pay for time waiting in traffic). What a world of difference. It's sad when the taxi-rides in developing countries are an order of magnitude better experience than in AK. Every Grab ride was more modern and clean than every taxi I've used in Alaska. 10 min wait to ride 300+ miles if you want",

And not everyone has pools and gardens. \nThe city said households consume 65-70% of city water but the credible figure is 48-52%. So 50% is consumed by business, industry, government, agriculture and informal settlements. But what restrictions have been placed on them? Nothing. Households bear the brunt of conservation and get blamed anyway. The city is not policing the 'water-saving technologies' businesses and government must instal.

Think of a man who is married and falls into a romantic attachment for another woman.   That man also is NOT permitted from following this to a sexual act because even though it would be consistent with both of their natures, it would be contrary to the binding commitment he made to his wife, and therefore contrary to his Soul.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to. Yet women are encouraged to be 'adult' by becoming sexualized - by having sex. How great is that? Ask, who benefits, and how.",

Whether or not you have cabs does not affect how other people need or not to wayfind. I absolutely agree though regards the sentiment that less can be more because this is a mistake I see so often in wayfinding design in that people think putting up more signs is always the solution.

It's the same as any employer having a policy in place, but one which it isn't obligated to follow due to law or labor contract. That policy may be there later today, or it may not. The policy may be followed, or it may not. \n\nThe Liberals could have easily included the policy's provisions in its recent legislative changes.

But it appears in one of the earliest poems in the Bible, the Song of the Sea, found in the middle of the book of Exodus [Exod 15:1-22]. This victory hymn probably dates to the 12th century B.C.E.\nIt's also important to note that the Exodus is a theme that's mentioned over and over again in various parts of the Bible. \nThe theme of a real people achieving freedom from oppression—that's something that resonates strongly with the biblical authors. \n(contrast that to the creation accounts and how you do not find that motif repeated in the OT)",

They are buying off on the idea that Russia's type of autocratic government is better than what we have.  I have yet to find a Trumpkin that sees how screwed up this is becoming under Der Fuehrer.  America was darn great before Trump, I only hope it will survive Trumpian Utopia",

The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.

PI has a valid point, we need to make sure we don't take our anger at the parents out on the children. Spenard, I'm being realistic, I don't think there is anything wrong questioning the parenting skills of inmates. The very fact they are in prison is a valid point in wondering if these children are in age environments and would they be safe to be around them when the parent gets out. A kidnapper is not a most likely not suitable parent in my opinion. Serving time in prison doesn't erase the severity of the crime. Prayers for these children, I wish them all the best.",

Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

So in the food chain, perhaps these fish have a job to eat and consume certain plants and animals to who's population will now not be controlled, which then has other effects. Perhaps these fish are the main food source for animals higher up on the food chain so now they will starve and their population will drop as a direct result which then has other effects on animals and plants that may connected to those animals.

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

Communism never failed in Norway, because Norway is not and never was a Communist country.\nNorway has a thriving market based economy that has the fortunate backing of a 67% government owned share in Norwegian multinational oil and gas company Statoil ASA.\n\nStatoil (then: Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S) was founded in 1973 with taxpayer money. Because of the large capital investment required to establish the industry it was fully backed by the state (taxpayer) and did not create profits until the early 1980's, but once established it was privatised in 2001.\nAlthough the State still holds a reduced amount of shares it has been selling them off and will continue to do so.\n\nThe highest ever percentage gained by the Communist Party of Norway was 11.9% in 1945 when it gained 11 out of 150 seats in parliament, they lost all 11 in the next election.\t\n\nPS: The current Government is Conservative.",

Their response was \"because we struggle to find enough who want to work for us\".  I agree that all workplaces should strive to accommodate key differences where it is feasible, for women (Mom's in particular), the disabled, and the sick.  Simple things like work from home, flex time, and some deadline flexibility would open a huge pool of talent and improve loyalty.  It could also result in better profits through increased productivity and lower wage costs, as not everybody is completely motivated by money alone.  Unfortunately those same 20 years has shown me both a lack of imagination and poor implementation too many times.",

God is a mystery, but so loved us that He humbled Himself to take on a human nature out of love.  That is a mystery.  Certainly through the Incarnation God is close to us, and moreso, in a sense, when we receive His Body and Blood.  I think rather than mystery/otherness as something to be sought, many EF folks seek transcendance - - a sense of the holy and sacred which the quiet and contemplation of the EF fosters better for some people.   Another poster in the thread spoke of the Mass as feeling like a supper club (I know this is not your position), and for many, I think, it lacks a sense of the reverence appropriate to the Divine and to our Savior.  As in many Catholic things, it's both/and  God with us in the Incarnation and the Body and Blood, yet still retaining all of His Divine attributes wherein He is the creator and we are the creatures.  \n\nDoes that make sense?",

The fact is the current cost estimate for two new Air Force One 747's is $3.8 billion dollars, when the commercial cost for two 747's is about $1.6 billion. Have you ever heard of a defense contract that did not over run by at least 50%? You may recall Airbus won the contract to supply new military air tankers until Boeing's lobbyists went to work.

Bad management of fisheries and maritime sanctuary have reduced eco-health pervasively. Renewed poison-drip mining ops and nitrogen run-off to create dead zones proliferate. Whales are an indicator species of eco-health. Maybe the villagers penalty should be a large suspended fine and requirements that they take marine biology courses from U.A.F.

Historically however, the issue is arguable in favour of Catalonia; because it was somehow an autonomous Principality until it was integrated in the Crown of Aragon by marriage in 1137. It then became part of Spain when the Crowns of Aragon and Castille fused together to form Spain. And finally with the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, all non-Castilian institutions, forms of public governance and even official language were abolished by force, as a result of the Bourbon Line's victory in that War in 1714.\nSo... historically, they do have a point to make!",

That means it needs to be transported and pipelines are the most efficient and safest option to do so.  Right now a substantial amount is moving by rail and truck which as LAc Magantic shows can be deadly.\n\nAre there risks to pipelines, yes mostly from leaks, but that is still safer than exploding rail cars.

I think because of modern perspectives in sex (thanks to Kinsey the quack, et al.), too many people over-emphasize the importance of sex in life.  The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

What they didn't count on was Trump winning the election and dragging this out into the open. Trump's opponents dished out a whole campaign of innuendo trying to link him to anything. Let's see if they can take it when faced with the same tactics. I'll venture a prediction. If this continues for too long, Trump will go after Hillary for the security breaches fiasco.

Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said \"object\". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S.",

The only problem with that is that rising secularism and rejection of religion is a relatively new concept.  Secularists fail to realize that much of what they deem moral is derivative of some religion somewhere.  It's just a matter of time before evil takes the place that God used to hold.",

But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans.

But the Commonwealth Fund wishes to draw attention to its work and objectives - and sensationalized ranking does that.",

Purchase of passenger vehicles was up by 3.8%, homeowners’ replacement cost (i.e. dwelling prices) by 4.3%, natural gas by 15.6%. And there will almost certainly be governments imposing additional costs in 2017 whatever the potential output gap. Often there is no difference between the CPIX and CPIXV8 rates of inflation, but in January the CPIX inflation rate was 1.7% versus 1.8% for CPIXV8, the difference being hikes in indirect taxes.",

The weapons charge was due to a hand gun that was still on the seat of his car after he had been target shooting, that had inadvertently had a coat pushed onto it. The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

I do know that the recent reduction of the assumed rate of return on PERS investments had a big impact on what the taxpayers had to make up. And of course, the assumed rate of return is still way too high, so more pain to come for the taxpayers. Perhaps more focus should be put on the way PERS invests, investment costs, etc. Not that the rate of return will get back to 7 percent any time soon, but I do know, for example, that its hedge fund and private equity investments have underperformed for the better part of a decade. Simplifying its investments and shedding the losers all would save fees and possibly lead to a greater rate of return.",

If you insist on omnipotence (and/or any of the other assumed infinite attributes with which gods are commonly credited), you cannot also insist on logical coherence, and vice versa.

They demanded and received an almost verbatim copy of the plan touted by the Heritage Foundation, the authors of the Massachusetts bill that Romney was proclaiming such a success during the last election cycle.

At signing, the fact that this was a first try at a plan for the nation was talked about; the tragedy of it is that like most committee derived plans, it adequately solved few problems.
