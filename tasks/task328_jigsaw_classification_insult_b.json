Say what you want about Kim but he is perfect for causing instability in a region and government which is exactly what Russia wants to be able to take advantage of. So for Russia having an emotional, erratic, crazy, militant dictator as president who has an itchy trigger finger and addicted to absolute power through executive orders is their dream. Good thing that's only happening in North Korea and not in America. Lol",

China will slap down Porky if it's economic interests are threatened, and India and Vietnam would love to have the kind of business we give China.\n\nSecond, announce a major initiative towards nuke-interception. Reagan got respect with talk about SDI, and we certainly have better technology now. The ability to nullify Porky's nukes (and anyone else's) will stabilize the whole region, preventing Japan and South Korea from pursuing their own nukes.

The Hunter has to be closer, more opportunity for the prey to smell or see the hunter.  Other than snares or deadfalls, clubs or spears are some of the basic, traditional hunter tools.

He is likely to fire Mueller and to pardon anyone who can hurt him -- including himself.\nThe fact that POTUS is crazy is not grounds to impeach, and the process for removing him because he's crazy is beyond cumbersome.

Races that lived in the more moderate or tropical climates had many means of accessing food and the challenges by the weather for shelter was minimal.  The necessity for technology was minimized.  Cultures in climates farther away from the equator had to not only fight for resource but also develop technologies to advance in the harsher conditions.  Seemed pretty interesting.  It certainly doesn't mean someone from an equatorial climate couldn't successfully enter the more technological environment.

So, let's kill dual citizenship, enforce tax laws in full, tax vacancies, maybe limit foreign buyers to new, or one unit only, and so on.  Quit handing out visas like candy.

They are true Patriotic Americans like Trump, who is proud he wasn't one those 'suckers' who actually paid taxes to support the country, just as these folks are proud they are not being forced into paying union dues for the benefits they get from Union representation.",

Some 33% of all such claims are denied by refugee boards - the probability of denial appears to have been based upon country of origin with Egypt having received the highest percentage of refugee acceptance in 2014/2013. These numbers being apart from sponsored refugees as well as legal immigrants and their dépendants, under family re-unification programs.\n\nOne wonders what the total numbers will be this year and how Ottawa will find the cash to support their ongoing needs - food, shelter, education, job training, legal bills, health and dental care etc - when they can't seem to find the funds to lift so many of OUR urban poor out of poverty.",

There has never been \"piled up\" applications  for B&B hotels that were not processed. On Oahu, vacation rentals are legal and allowed in resort zoning, but are illegal in all other zoning, including residential. Unfortunately in recent years, scofflaw mainland-companies such as Airbnb and VRBO have been recruiting Hawaii residential property owners (many out-of-state investors) to open-up illegal vacation rentals in our neighborhoods. Housing studies show these illegal rentals reduce our residential housing supply and increase housing cost for our residents. Neighbors have also documented that these hotel-like businesses changes the residential character of their neighborhoods by displacing neighbors with a revolving door of strangers. A \"win-win\" situation is to keep residential-zoning for residential use and keep vacation rentals in resort-zoning only.",

So the first bill sounds like the fox watching the hen house.  It would be like Dow chemical self reporting the harmful effects of their products (or manipulating a weak minded govt that has sold out Americans for profit). \nThe second bill sounds great in theory in terms of certification, which would also give recourse to the consumer being able to report rentals to a govt entity and might allow for standards and fair practices.  But a conservative minded individual like myself would be wary of the costs of running a certification branch and wonder if the costs of this would match or supersede the tax revenue generated.",

When these injuries happen there is usually not a solid plan on what to do.  In 100% of these cases we are looking at minutes - not very many- to save a life.  In 100% of the cases where a bleed is suspected Life Flight / Chopper must be called - 100% of the time.  And schools and EMT's need to know that most Hospitals are not set up to handle these injuries so the fact they transported him twice is a real concern.

The tomahawk has always been a mascot, and even part of a coat of arms as whitey isn't the only one to have those. The tomahawk chop used by the Seminoles, and now found everywhere, is nothing more than a rallying cry. For thousands of years when Native American's held competitions you found all types of mascots, and many types of rallying cries. Furthermore, white people never have a problem if I a red skin Chickasaw, dance in a line or square joining in, in their traditional fun, and some even giggle when I do an Irish jig.

But your point of paying more in taxes is something all of us (collective \"us\", I couldn't resist) need to understand to solve this and other government spending problems.  Cutting programs is only going to take us so far and a \"booming\" economy bringing in more revenue will only take us so far.  Quite honestly, the more I think about these problems, the more it seems to me that our 74,608-page-long federal tax code and comparable state tax codes are the \"root of all evil\" concerning state and federal budgets/programs.  Sort that out and I think everything else becomes much, much easier.  Bottom line, I think we are very close to being on the same page regarding this issue in my opinion.",

The problem is that the Grand Master is highly unlikely to accept Boeselager's return.\n\n2. Appoint an external commissioner. This would place all religious aspects of the order under the authority of the Vatican which would be separate from the order’s charitable work and diplomatic relations with states. The Holy See would examine the religious life of the knights to ensure it is in accordance with Church norms. This would also constrain the power of Cardinal Burke, whose role has been to represent the Pope to the knights: with a commissioner in place Burke would have a layer of authority over him.

Well, God's creation of life is based on O2 and C02 with human and animal life needing oxygen, giving off CO2 in return, and plants needing CO2 to live and grow, giving off O2 in return.

Unless the city can point to credible studies that shows perfect symmetry, this argument is weak.\nWhich leads me to the fallacious statement 'Property value is a reasonable indicator of ability to pay'.  Says who? Gentrification and increasing property values esp in Cape Town has seen many residents struggle to keep up with rates, which increases based on value, a point I think Merten made. Vd Merwe is obviously among the misguided few who believe title ownership of 'high value' properties implies household income/cash reserves to match. Rubbish!

When the Republicans accused him of giving money to Ms. Clinton when she campaigned for senator, he said truthfully as a businessman, he gave money to both parties, that was the only way to get things done in business. He referenced several Republican he was debating as to taking his money, and Rand Paul asked if he could get some more, as the crowd laughed! At that point, he said something very true about America, both parties do the bidding of the money behind them, not the common man who they can lie to for votes.\nI knew then, like Mr. Sanders said about Ms. Clinton and Wall St., this man who used his own money and small donors like Mr. Sanders, would take down both parties, and I said he'd win the election",

That is considered a direct abortion. I've heard that breast cancer discovered during pregnancy is very difficult to contain and aggressive treatment is required.

Treatments were carefully examined. Mad people of the time were simply locked up, but the king couldn't be. So he was studied and treated. Nobody really knew what to do, but the fact that it was treated seriously as an illness changed everything. Was he bipolar? Did he suffer from porphyria? I don't know. But we all became richer by the fact his illness was taken seriously. And treating it as farce is inexcusable. Bennet's humour should be of the gallows kind. As one found in The Lady in the Van.

Even before that, while little known in Lane County, back  in the early 1980s Douglas County had a powerful freedom-loving  civil-rights organization \"BALANCE\", (\"It's time to balance the scales of justice between marijuana and alcohol.\")  It's logo was the scales of justice, with a marijuana leaf at one end and a grape cluster (wine) at the other.\nWe were able to block the sheriff from a number of nasty busts and almost got rid of  the county's forfeiture law.  Most of the evils we opposed were dealt with by Oregon's new law discussed by Motley.  We can expect  Sessions to be hot for eliminating Oregon's legal marijuana sales.",

Prior to 1977, there was a clear line between news and entertainment, with the former treated as necessary to demonstrating the networks' commitment to serving the public interest; that service was a condition of their license to use the \"public airwaves.\" As a result, news divisions were allowed--in fact expected--to lose money. That changed in 1977, when Roone Arledge, then the head of ABC sports, moved into his new role leading the network's news division, bringing the kind of splashy promotion and ratings-centric philosophy that had been a primary driver of sports television. It was all downhill from there.\n\nSo while it is true that news is relatively inexpensive to produce and news operations are now expected to pull their own weight, that does not have to be the case.

The same day an editorial said how unfortunate that only the public sector could afford indexing. You suggest that. I had a look. Two points.\n\nThe deficit was due to under funding. The 1980 Actuarial Report shows a cost of 4.7% of salary with 2% of salary being deposited. With indexing looking expensive, the private sector had an excuse not to index. Under funding served a purpose.\n\nInflation decreases purchasing power. Everyone knows that. Inflation also increases interest rates, thus more money flows into pension accounts compensating for the decrease in purchasing power. The employer has a choice, either index pensions or pocket the money. The media never mentions the increase in interest rates. Nor the under funding. I hope that this helps.",

Hopefully some parents in your area will see this and be able to join.\n\nOur daughter had a speech delay.  We started to realize there was an issue when she went from 12, to 13, to 14 months old and only had one word.  And from there, the journey started from doctors appointments and hearing tests, speech therapy and surgery for tubes in her ears.\n\nIn the end, it turned out well.  She's a super chatty 5 year old now with lots of spunk!\n\nWhat I learned form the who process is that it's important to take action right away, so I recommend any parents in the area do check out this session if you can.\n\nFor those who aren't near the area, please check my site before for the story of what happened to us, and how to get help for your toddler.\n\nwww.toddlerspeechboost.com",

At this point it's your issue not hers. I have a good male friend who's like my brother, and hubby knew this before we dated. No romantic feelings on either side and he's not gay. In fact he's almost more protective of me than hubby is. They respect each other and me.  This is the only way it works, so if you're jealous it won't.",

How many votes can be won by offering services without any receprical effort from a patient dying of 'bad habits'.  \n\nMaybe I'm too pessimistic, but when somebody has to write the regulation and small detail of who pays what, for what treatment, we would have to keep that out of the hands of the political body.    We know as fact that favored status can always be purchased from the less that honorable in Congress or Statehouse.   In many cases it's a decision supported by The Party, giving lots of people cover within the Party structure. \n\nSingle payer is fine, but independent and rational leadership is critical.

The government through building essential infrastructure goods and services can use all the idle labour, just as we did during World War 11 at the end of the depression. The creation of long lasting public goods, is public wealth creation. The jobs produce taxes, more consumption, more bank loans and private economic activity. The reduction in unemployment and poverty reduces the pressure on governments at all levels. The full employment helps reduce social pathology, and gives youth the opportunities they need. Currently youth unemployment is double the Canadian rate. A job meets the essential needs of feeling valued and making a contribution. \n\nFull employment reduces social division, and reduces the attraction of right wing, authoritarian populism.",

Traditionally, they spoke everything.  They wrote down nothing.  Thankfully, UAF linguists just finished formulating what previously unwritten Alaskan spoken languages ... would look like if they actually were in print.  Now state paid translators will be available to explain what the newly written versions of unwritten dialects look like and what they mean.   Knowledge is good.  Some this program will be expanded to include Samoan, Tongan, Tagalog, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, and French written versions of Alaskan election materials along with state paid translators at polling places.

Coderre, a way more experienced politician won the election. Then, the Liberals recruited her.\n- Once elected, Trudeau made her a cabinet minister and she disappeared only to re-appear this week.\n- She also speaks in what the press here are calling the language \"Melanie Joly\" - that only she understands. She has a kind of stream of conscience speak a la Trump. Of course not insane like Trump but the same kind of weird verbal ramble, She covers a lot of territory when answering a question.

But don’t nobody ever ask what did they do to Hitler.”\n\n\"White people are potential humans – they haven’t evolved yet.\"\n\n“The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that’s a good name. Hitler was a very great man.”\n\nThe Nation of Islam is a small fringe organization in the USA, with less than 40,000 members.  Yet, Ali was a member and fully endorsed their extremist beliefs.\n\nThe renown Southern Poverty Law Center has a detailed article about their well documented extremism and racism.

The art of compromise is anathema.  2. Processes that flow from the above don't depend on rationality or intellect but on emotion. Sr. Elizabeth Johnson somewhere described that we come to act in this way: \"from the heart to the head to the hands.\" Most of us are like Plato's cave dwellers, refusing to throw off  our broken attachment to rationality as platform for action. \"Other candidate\" saw the value of heart (emotion) first. \"Loser\" is abhorrent, an ultimate evil.  He's brilliant, transparent, dangerous.  By the way +Francis also proceeds from the heart to the head to the hands.  Think.  Critics oppose him with: \"It's confusing.\"",

Maybe with Goins @ ss, his glove as good for sure as Tulowitzki, probably on balance superior, more speed on the bases, timely hitting, Your Js are better off, who knows...\n\nOnly matters b/c there's 3 years left on his contract @ $20 m per, and it's obvious though rarely discussed on Your Js platforms, whaddaya gonna do with him?  The #s say you don't need him to win, but trading him?  No way.  A buyout at some point, probably after next season, expect it.",

I'm not sure why you keep telling me and others that we are confused and what our opinions are. Why don't you let us tell you what we are confused about and what our opinions are.

Kanaka maoli do not share the 'good health' that other populations in our state have.\"\n\nThese health disparities occur mostly in rural and undeserved communities where Hawaiians are over-represented, where most are Medicaid beneficiaries and members of a MedQuest health plan, but where they still lack adequate access to health care.  Many can't find a participating plan doctor willing and able to care for them. \n\nThe lack of adequate provider networks violates both Federal law and MedQuest contracts, but state officials have turned a blind eye for years and years. \n\nOHA and others concerned about health disparities should call for monitoring and enforcement of these basic Medicaid health plan network adequacy requirements.\n\nIn Hawaii,  these plans get over $2 billion a year and they need to step it up!",

Hundreds of thousands of military aged males flood Europe's borders and the EU's response is highlighted by shameless political impotence. Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium - their modern secular societies are under attack from regressive cultures who have no intention of integrating.

Had they funded immediately there would have NO money needed at the time of an individual's retirement...it would have already been in the account and \"growing\" along with the other half.  Instead, the amount due at retirement reflects the growth in the individual's account...only half of which is really there.  That matching amount has to be funded at retirement by contract.

Once you get the daily calories intake based on your age, height and activity level you go from there. The truth is that people can eat more or less than the recommended daily calories and although I am an active senior and swim laps 3 times a week I eat about 1650 calories on a swim day and 1550 on the other days and I stay at my IBW. That is a bit below the 2000 daily level but that is the way it is. I also saw another way to quickly access your calorie needs and that is an active person can consume 12 calories per pound a day per body weight and inactive person can consume 10 calories per pound a day in body weight. The fun part is to do some of the math on the calories charts and one will find that eating as little as 200 calories per day beyond what your body can use will result in a lot of weight gain.

There is a natural CO2 cycle on this planet of which humans consuming fossil fuels is a tiny part. Each human exhales about a kilo of this 'pollution' every day. They also use the term 'carbon' rather than carbon dioxide, I suppose because it tends to have a dirty connotation, like the stuff that sticks to your fireplace walls. When the media shows stories on climate change they always show 'smoke' billowing from chimneys. What you see in those pictures is likely mostly water vapour and other particulates: Cue the smog in Beijing and elsewhere. CO2 is an odourless and colourless gas!",

            "input": "Comment: One of the things about these articles is the general lack of real numbers one might use to make a comparison. For example, the closest one in this article is that the company is investing 6 B pounds into the Hornsea area development. Using a conversion of 2:1 for CAD : British pound and assuming that includes a full capacity build of 5 GW that works out to $2.40 CAD per watt ($12 B CAD/5 GW). If the build covered is only the 2.6 GW now in the construction phase, the unit cost is still competitive at $4.61. Compare that with Site C in BC:  probably at least $10 B CAD for 1.1 GW works out to $9.09 CAD/watt- hmmm. As I mentioned though, despite the simplicity of this analysis it would be nice to get some solid numbers included in the articles to reduce the fudge factors and \"spin\" opportunities- on both sides of the argument.",
