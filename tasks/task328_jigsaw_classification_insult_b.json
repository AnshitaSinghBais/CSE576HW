There is no \"P\" sound in the Arab language.  The great terrorist & murderer, Arafat, was born in Cairo in 1929.  When in history did these people exist?    The bigots have a problem for Jews to live in Jerusalem.  Jerusalem has been the capitol of the Jewish people before Ottawa, Washington, London, or Paris existed.

That money that you pay for a mortgage would otherwise go to rent. Not only that, rent is subject to inflation, whereas mortgages are only variable based on changes in lending rates. So for a mortgage, maybe average 4% interest over 25 years and work out the cost. But for rent, take this year as the baseline and then add an inflation rate, currently at least 3-4%, but even if only 2% when compounded over 25 years is a lot of money!! Plus half the costs he attributes to owning a house, such as furnishings, baby gadgets, etc, are incurred regardless of whether you rent or own.\n\nAbsolute garbage.",

Frequently, they don't see themselves as poor even when they actually are. Rather they view themselves as temporarily \"down on their luck\" and look up to the rich (Trump-like figures) as role models even though in reality they have almost no chance of emulating them, their lifestyles or wealth especially in the absence of an education. The white lower middle class men (especially) seem to view educated women (like Hillary Clinton or professional women) with disdain. \nClass isn't as cogent in America not because of elitism in academia (which of course exists) but rather because Americans eschew class comparisons and the very idea of equality.",

Control of the region assures dominance of the dollar, a dominance essential to the survival of the U.S. marred in deep debt. Degrade dollar hegemony and the debt blowup will make 2008 a firecracker.

Not because the Inuit peoples have hunted the whales for centuries to sustain themselves, but because YOUR past relatives hunted the whales to near extinction for whale oil, and nothing else.

It is a part of their culture; a culture that has existed for centuries.

Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive \"toys\", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax.",

Sufferers of PUSSYS often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, the delusion that they are the majority, sudden & prolonged bouts of self-pity coupled w/inexplicable feelings of euphoria followed by uncontrollable whining. PUSSYS is characterized by a persistent unwillingness to see that Trump is a pathological liar put in office by Putin & is an illegitimate president. In moments of lucidity, they experience intense fear that Trump will be impeached. Research is ongoing, but PUSSYS appears to correlate closely w/some of the following factors: Conservatism, profound ignorance; excessive religiosity, NRA membership, living in isolated rural areas. PUSSYS is known to rapidly reproduce in red states.",

BARKER (RUFF, RUFF, RUFF), a New York City merchant and political leader. They ran candidates for office in 1854, and had some success in local elections in the northeast.\n\nIn 1856 former president Millard Fillmore ran as the Know-Nothing candidate for president.

People with insurance through their jobs still pay by having lower salaries than they would have if their employers did not have to pay the huge cost of health care.  My husband and I have been able to have a small family business only because we were willing to take the risk of no insurance.  We were lucky, and now we are on Medicare.  I have no doubt that many other families forgo their desire to have their own businesses because they can't afford the risk.

Pretty progressive. To qualify as one of the 1%, one merely needs to earn as little as $220k. If that's our country's benchmark for Top 1% (and tax 53% of their top income away) our country has done a dismal job creating economic opportunity for its entrepreneurs.   If we're talking 'fairness' - what is being done to enable the 70% of the population who do not have defined benefit pensions to save?  I work, save and invest to build a 'pension'.  Every purchase and sale is re-invested to grow my pension.  Unlike a pension (which buys and sells equities for its members and re-invests it) every sale by a non-pension holder is taxed at at the top rate.  Fair?",

On what authority did he have to sell it without public input, and why was it not offered to the highest bidder? I did not see a for sale sign on this building prior to the sale.

No. KPMG must be made to divulge the truth, the full truth and only the truth and if it means they close their doors, good riddance.

Considering Ward's play, locker room leadership, what the team looked like when he agreed to join, and the attitude he helped instill, I can see him feeling under-respected for his contribution. All employees, whether it's the NFL or a start-up, have pride of ownership and contribution. It's a lousy situation, but temporary.

If the gangs had some sort of political or religious philosophy, the situation would be recognized for what it is -- a civil war.

I use those, and cut the corner off of a heavy-gauge plastic ziploc style bag (I prefer the kind with the zipper for this). You can then easily attach standard pastry bag tips to that.\n\nThat way, you can fill the bag and zip it closed, preventing messy accidents that can happen when you aren't holding a pastry bag properly. This doesn't help the cleanup much, though, unless you're willing to throw the plastic bag away after each use. I wash mine.",

By contrast, you are repeating an interpretation about economics (an incorrect one) that is peddled by latter-day Confederate apologists.\n\nRacism within the union had nothing to do with it -- the goal was to preserve the union, as a democratic republic.  Over time, it was seen that abolishing slavery was necessary to win that struggle.  And the declaration of slaves being free was, in the first instance, an executive order which wasn't voted upon.  When the 13th Amendment was passed, like all other amendments to the US Constitution, it had a 2/3rds majority.",

Cooling CAN be a fast event if you get a large enough eruption (the aerosols cool the earth way more than the released greenhouses gases warm it in those eruptions) - see Tambora and Krakatoa.\nWhy is it so hard for you to accept the fact that human emissions are causing this unprecedented warming?

This disorder is characterized by a disregard for the feelings of others, a lack of remorse or shame, manipulative behavior, unchecked egocentricity, and the ability to lie in order to achieve one's goals.\" \n\nIMO, Mr. Trump is not just a sociopath,  he's the posterchild for the disorder.  My \"basis for calling Trump a sociopath.\" is the long and continuing history of his comments and actions.  If you're willing to completely disregard his actions, perhaps you can contend he doesn't evidence those sociopathic behaviors.  Perhaps you might look at his recent actions and comments in Mexico contrasted with those in Phoenix.  Those are just the latest manifestation of his disorder.  \n\nI contend that anyone who is familiar with Mr. Trump and his long history of very nasty business and personal dealings has every reason to oppose him.",

It's entirely possible the daughter did something quite serious and in need of consequences but on arriving at the scene was not the time to determine this. First make certain both children are safe, DE escalate, and begin gathering information. Find out fromboth children what happened from each of their points of view. The mother is 100% correct however, that absent any clear evidence the daughter began the violence, there is nothing she could have done which would justify the violence committed against her. Violence is only permissible as a defence against existing violence and only in measured proportion to that violence. Obviously children do not know this until taught.",

The Church is horribly deficient in updating its understanding  of it, has danced around the issues while modern science has increased out knowledge of humans and sex by the hundredfold.  Ignorance hurts way too many to be allowed to just continue because some clerics are frightened of what it might reveal (including about ordained life) and what it might lead to.  This is theology in pursuit of safety, not of God.  God's Creation is so much more calmly diverse and inclusive, and if the Church is to tear down its self-made divisions between believers in Christ, then it needs to open the window on all of the issues you mention for some fresh air per St. John XXIII.",

By December 2006, in the final bill the buyback program total has dropped to $25,000,000. This pretty well explained why the total payment stream that SEAS contractually agreed to with Advance North LLC shows up in what might be recently re-worked versions of the contracts, unsigned, that were presented to the Alaska Public Office Commission (APOC), with the 'after performance' part totaling over $240,000. \n\nPombo took $18,000 in campaign contributions from VECO execs in 2005 and 2006, his two PACs got $250,000 in oil money, and he helped stop a FDIC investigation of sleazy financier Charles Hurwitz.",

Propornot writers (whoever they are) attempted a similarly secretive and arbitrary censorship of media outlets, but that was ok with you because of your ideological bias. And yet, when Civil Beat faces an arbitrary restriction on media access by a secretive process/body, it is suddenly unacceptable? Interesting contradiction!\n\nSecondly, you are  relying on a strawman argument by asserting that the \"trolls\" who disagree with you here are only focusing on a couple of bad journalists from several years ago. I think the point you are missing is that the fake news in \"mainstream media\", which you consider an anomaly, is actually systemic and continuous, i.e. status quo.\n\nAlso, can you identify the \"trolls\" here, and do you permit your students to use ad hominem attacks in their assignments?",

Deficits went up, but after the tax cuts in 2002 and even after the war began in 2003, deficits went down beginning in 2004 until they bottomed out at 161 billion in FY 2007. Then after the democrats took control of the house in Jan. 2007, the deficit exploded to 458 billion in FY 2008. A 400 billion increase in the deficit due to democrats in the house in just one year.

We would not need it if we built up West Oahu College to a full 4 -year institution like Manoa and this, keep west students out west.  Can we afford it?  Apparently not.  10 billion and counting...  Can we maintain it?  Of course, we won't really know until it is finished, if ever, but I\"m going to predict that we cannot afford to maintain it without higher taxes.

Several of the best environmentalists and other typically \"social service/justice\" type categories have been championed by the right here in Hawaii. And in direct contrast, many of the left are all about \"mo money, mo money, mo money\" with NO regard of how the little guys money is spent to pay for things.\nExamples :\n1) The only reason we have all of the homeless shelters open today that we do is because Republican Governor Lingle invoked emergency powers to bypass the democrat control Legislature and get the shelters open. She opened 7 or 8 shelters in a matter of 6 months. and housed close to 3,000 people. The next legislative session there were over 26 bills introduced, all designed to limit her power.",

When Jalen Jelks is quoted by the Oregonian that he's making sure Prevot is alright rather than expressing concern for the female athlete he allegedly hit, I hear him saying that the \"brotherhood\" of the team is more important than being a good person of high moral character. Hopefully a new coach will create a new atmosphere where toxic masculinity doesn't rule the culture. \n\nLeaders and people at large, powerful institutions are good at saying the right things but they need to be pushed for specifics which then need to be investigated.

But for the purists out there, an M1 Garand (think WWII and Korea) a clip would be correct but it only holds 8 rounds. Spend some time on your search engine of choice and you'll see what I mean.\nI own two AR type carbines and lots of thirty round magazines. Seldom do I ever fill them to max capacity but when I do, I do. The main reason is I don't want to bother with reloading so often. There are times when I just want to keep up a sustained rate of fire. Mostly this occurs when I am teaching somebody specific shooting techniques and/or circumstances.\nIf you haven't, take a trip over to the Bear's Den and shoot their Thompson sub-machine gun on semi and full automatic.",

Local communities cannot suspend the Constitution based on popular vote. Thank goodness for that, or else you may still have communities where slavery is practiced and where women are not allowed to vote. Each member of this community, in a sense, puts this matter to a vote when he or she elects representatives who vow to uphold the 1st amendment; the People could elect representatives to repeal the First Amendment if they so choose, and yet they do not.

Now, recent reports show that a known bacterium is overtaking numbers of MRSA infections in hospital settings, making physicians re-evaluate prevention tactics nationally and leading to a local study which may help with the creation of a vaccine to stop the spread of the illness. \n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 28,000 people in the United States die from Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile, annually.",

And polls have consistently shown that a large minority of Western Muslims (around 30% of youth) support the aims of the most violent death cult in our history.
