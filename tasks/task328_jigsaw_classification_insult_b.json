Secondly, if you were to apply the same logic, Hillary had no intent nor did she share the information. Trump had intent and did share the information, so no comparison. \n\nKeep in mind the damage Trump did wasn't just playing footsie with Russian spies. He betrayed a promise made to the nation who provided the information. The promise was that we wouldn't share that information (even within our own government) without their consent. Intelligence relies on relationships and cooperation (which are concepts foreign to Trump). When you violate those relationships, the information dries up, we are less safe, and Trump, again, violates his solemn oath to protect the United States from all enemies.",

As a college math professor for ten years, who has taught college algebra countless times, I am very familiar with the standard curriculum of a college algebra course. The course revolves around learning different families of functions, such as exponential, rational, logarithmic, etc. A quality course will spend a lot of time on modeling using each of these function families. For a more informed understanding of the current college algebra curriculum and the change in it's direction, read articles on \"a modeling approach to college algebra\". Regarding the alternative courses that are taught, these cover many applicable topics in math that very few people are exposed to, such as financial math, logic, and graph theory. My opinion is that these topics are just as important as those taught in college algebra and should be considered as a viable math alternative.",

The new ratio of working people to retired that rolls out between 2027 and 2032 is unlikely to change and our policies should assume that ratio. Programs like defined benefit private pension plans, good health insurance, the old age supplement, and well run nursing homes will help not hinder.

No criminal record as it is enacted through provincial legislation dealing with road safety. Why does it work?

In eight hours, an officer could conceivably intercept and deal with 4 x 8 = 32 impaired drivers. Higher probability of getting caught equals a change in behaviour.",

Mosiana is simply directing our attention to where the problem starts. Once we can agree on that, we can analyse how this situation came to be; but we need to see and agree that this is the reality, and that society's responses to it are racially biased. \n\nTo say that it is racially biased is not to gloss over the rape of white women.

Higher network water pressure increases the flow rate of underground leaks; increases the water customers draw for their own needs (car washing/gardening); induce bursts which cause interruptions to customers' water supply and decrease pipe lifetime. The state of Washington may not have water scarcity issues but I don't see the sense in losing more water and damaging water infrastructure whilst poisoning nature with chlorinated water, all to give customers a luxuriously high water pressure. The more water that is lost from water networks, the more that needs to be drawn from nature. I don't see anything in this article that tells me why water pressures are being increased across the network to then only be decreased (at a massive cost) at the customer boundary.\nI'd be really interested to know the backstory to this scheme",

Many are more interested in how much their religion is relevant to the more and more secular culture.     If we are a small minority, this is no special problem.

There is no projection that shows Lithium battery prices coming down by anything close to what is required to make these calculations work. \n\nYes, we all hope for the breakthrough in battery technology that makes storage cost-effective. Then we are 100% in agreement: let's run the world on wind and solar. \n\nBut if you are planning NOW for the next 20 years, you can't just do nothing and hope some new battery is invented. Similarly, if you're talking about 20GW of household solar, they need to install batteries now. And the batteries currently available (even the cheaper, less effective Lead batteries) are an order of magnitude too expensive. \n\nBesides, this study doesn't make a claim that it relies on yet-to-be-invented battery technology. It says with current technologies that 100% renewable is cost-effectively doable. It is not.",

Wait and watch, he already is abandoning his core group. I am waiting for a return to sanity in this country and it needs to come soon. Kim Jong Un needs constant applause every time he shows his face in North Korea and if the common folk do not laud him with praise, they are in fear of reprisals. This sounds a lot like a cabinet meeting Trump had where all the appointees were asked, essentially, to dole out praise and gratitude to the boss. Sound Familiar?\nDavid Wright",

She is an award winning political and social columnist for Canada's national newspaper who is the only major market political columnist to win the annual award for being the best of this elite group two years in a row.   \n\nYou, on the other hand, are an obsessed Liberal troll on the internet and are well known as such.\n\nAnd while you are unscrupulous and fascist enough to frequently have your critics silenced by having their posts deleted as invasions of your \"safe area\", you cannot silence Maggie Wente, thank Heavens.\n\nYou compared to Wente is like a Lada to a Lamborghini.",

Now it staggers along, with a diverse rainbow of frustrated voters looking for some sort of representation in a myriad of candidates sprinkled over half a dozen parties with the numbers of seats won not depending on how many voted for you but whether they lived close enough together - encouraging regional divisions and leaving the huge majority of voters holding noses to vote against instead of for and knowing it really doesn't matter because their vote is most likely to elect absolutely no one.\nThere are DOZENS of options better than this, that foster cooperation and make MPs accountable.

We have a bi-racial biological Grandson and two adopted African American Grandchildren.  If I accept such racistcomments without confronting them, I feel I'm being a traitor to my Grandchildren.  I won't do that.  Good day to you, sir,....Bob, I'll catch you later.\"  I then left.  \n\nYour post seems to imply that I was \"intolerant\" for not accepting, and instead confronting his comment.  How do you feel about my action?  regards, Gary",

In general, most people in Hawaii intuitively understand what 100% clean electricity looks like. Everyone has seen wind mills and solar panels, and it is not a huge mental leap to imagine scaling wind and solar up - and adding a smarter grid and a decent amount of energy storage to achieve 100% clean electricity.\nUnfortunately, transportation is more complex and there are many more misconceptions about the energy, land use and cost implications of different policies and infrastructure investments.  Here's a few questions I'd like you to contemplate: What % of Oahu residents have driver's licenses?  How much does it cost to own and operate a car annually?  How many parking stalls are needed for each car on the island and how much does it cost to build parking?  How much does it cost to operate TheBus?  What % of Oahu residents today (and in 2030) are over 65?",

I'm not overly concerned about the UNDRIP due to the fact that such declarations generally have greater moral than legal impact and by-and-large aren't enforceable. I believe the greater risk is that a government keen to prove its credibility on aboriginal issues could align our administrative and legal processes to comply with the declaration before understanding its real impacts and implications.",

If she was so concerned with 'harm reduction' why wasn't she doing it in the context of outreach for a non-profit agency? Oh that's right, because not only was she involved in the game herself, she was profiting from it. Funny how it's not until someone is caught, that they are all about victims' rights and reform all of a sudden. I'm not saying Ms. Batts' upbringing had nothing to do with her predicament, but it was a series of bad choices that ultimately landed her where she is today.",

So if you do the math, it seems that what ever Kaiser claims to be putting out, they will be reimbursed and then some by the state (taxpayers).\nLooks to me like the state  taxpayers are still left footing the bill. Whether it is in loses that the legislature has to pay the to the hospital or subsides paid to Kaiser. Bottom line looks like the state taxpayers still coughing up in excess of $30+ a year. And where do you think most of the taxpayers money come from???? From Oahu where the bulk of the state's population is.",

My solution would be to put  pedestrian overpass there and Beluga Point.  Fence off the tracks. This has been done in the Seattle area where beach access crosses the tracks in their parks.  You could fence the whole arm and someone will be stupid and cross anyway. People will cross the fence and it's short sighted and moronic to think they won't. Sometimes you just can't fix stupid.",

Judge Esch, for example, threw out a valid appeal by one of the \"Fairbanks 4\" [who later were able to establish their innocence and regain their freedom].  The appeal was based on documented improper and prejudicial conduct by the jurors deciding the conviction of Roberts - as I said the grounds were valid, the conduct documented.  Esch dismissed the appeal on the grounds [his words quoted in DNM] that \"the Public deserves to have 'closure' in this matter.\"  A Public 'right' to closure does not exist, to my knowledge, in US jurisprudence.  That a young man should continue to serve time on an improperly decided conviction, simply because the Public [or Judge Esch] was tired of hearing about it, is abhorrent to our idea of Justice.",

And what about her Peeping Tom, \"pussy grabbing\" husband? I guess that's ok with you. So you approve of Trump deliberately walking into nude and half dressed teenage girl's rooms during pageants, and bragging about it?  He did that with grown women who were pageant contestants too, of course. How about when he was bragging about \"moving in\" on a married woman (I think his exact words were \"I went after her like a bitch\") when he was himself married. Oh, there's lots, lots more. The bottom line is if you voted for President Pussy Grabber, you've done far, far worse than the women who marched with a symbolic pink knit hat on their heads, protesting the pervert you put in the White House.",

Once again not seeing the irony in her labeling Afrikaners as racists.

When Social Security was set up, nobody expected beneficiaries to live for as long as they do now, or for economic growth rates to slow. Private sector defined benefit plans never foresaw the massive intensification of competition that forced many sponsors out of business. When circumstances change, so too must our plans, and many long cherished assumptions. For example, Federal employees have the Thrift Savings Plan -- a defined contribution plan that invests in index funds. Australia has mandatory savings in Superannuation funds, which are defined contribution plans. To say we have no choice but to raise taxes even higher to bailout PERA yet again (with no promise of improved government performance) is pure falsehood.",

There were never funds available for needed expansion in Bethel or Nome. The desire was to get prisoners out of the Private prisons in AZ and Colorado. That was accomplished. One might argue that we should have left them there- or refused to build the prison unless it was located in South Palmer- but not that there was a pot of money for rural expansion that had been redirected somehow to Goose Creek.

Outcomes at a trial can be very different depending on the quality of the prosecution. Justice is very illusive.  A trial does not guarantee justice or fairness.  Just a simple trial of before peers (or by a judge). Please remember what anything that you say can and will be used against you.  There is nothing that says anything can and will be used in your favor.  Police are not required to speak in your defense unless you call them as your witness.

So far this season, I've been quite pleased.  Trevor is working under a new offensive system, but he's more of a take charge guy.  Also, the Broncos' offensive line is better than it was last year, which means that Trevor won't be spending as much time flat on his butt.  If he keeps playing the way he has the first couple of games, I wouldn't be surprised if he represents the AFC in the Pro Bowl.",

From historical sources we now realize the brutality in the fight for the American Frontier was as \"savage' on the part of the white settlers as it was for the Indians defending their homes and lands.\nOne 4th of July I even heard the entire document read by a variety of celebrities on TV, including this horrible \"savage\" clause  which was actually read by a Native American!

They knew the militia was the mechanic down the road, the college student attending school full time, the nanny,the house wife and so on. So in order for a militia to form in time for action or on the spot these people needed to have their weapons at the ready. Other wise they could not have cut the British off at Lexington and Concord. They learned from the war that the people needed to be armed and so the Founders ensured we had that right in the Bill of Rights.

Adding lane capacity for cars has one very well-known effect: it causes more trips to be made by car. This well-proven concept is called induced demand and even car-crazy CalTrans has acknowledged that they must alter their policies because of what this means.\n\nSince 2008, Eugene has lost 9100 cyclists, pedestrians and bus riders from the commuting population.

Do some research and you will find that they win all sorts of awards and accolades for their innovation in environmental friendliness -  for example, they were awarded the \"Certificate of Environmental Stewardship\" last year for saving 3,749 barrels of oil, 6,900 cubic yards of landfill space and 1,328,000 kilowatt hours by recycling approximately 460,000 lbs. of plastic.

These descriptions of areas are vague at best and far from any type of accurate identification of any single place.

Checking traps and trap sites every 24hrs is unreasonable in Alaska and would not prevent dog catches.

Why?  Because \"marriage,\" by definition, meant one man, one woman (although in some instances, polygamy), but never man-man or woman-woman.    Note, by the way, that the Declaration, Article 10, says \"without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion.\"  It does not forbid a prohibition on grounds of sex, meaning man marrying man or woman marrying woman.  Indeed, such a prohibition would have been though absurd when the Declaration was passed in 1948, because the very idea of such \"marriage\" was absurd.",

The father is a millionaire and the mother (divorced) was getting at least $300k per year in alimony payments, and didn't really have to work for a living. If little Adam was having mental issues, the parents had MORE than enough money to pay for psychiatric treatments out of pocket; no government saviors needed. Yet the kid still goes on a rampage anyway. All that Lanza family money for mental illness treatment didn't keep those poor first graders alive.",

The people of Rhode Island have a right to ask what you know about them, their spiritual and pastoral needs, and whether you care more about them than the people you agreed to leave in Pittsburgh. In other words, the Church's practice of assigning bishops to benefices as \"promotions\" is one historical example of the way the Church rewards its clergy at the expense of its people. Now that you've been bishop of  Providence for 12 years,  you continue to display a Steelers flag at your residence, which many might consider an intentional slight against the people you've been sent to serve.

Where people fell on that spectrum impacted what types of relationships they were comfortable with. Someone 80% heterosexual could be happy going their entire life in only straight relationships, while someone 30% heterosexual - i.e. 70% homosexual, might have sex with the opposite sex but would probably be more comfortable in a homosexual relationship. It depends on degree & other factors, including one's family & society's attitudes. \n\nOn the other hand, when he measured gender characteristics he found that most adults are right in the middle with a mix of both feminine & masculine traits.

Nevertheless, given the comparative levels of discipline in the US Navy and the People's Liberation Army, it seems more likely that such an incident could arise from a hothead on the Chinese side - then the question would be \"how would the US respond?\"",

Others are resorting to red herrings and strawmen to decry your actions. In both cases, the attempt is to deny the elephant in the room -- HATE. Especially interesting is the argument that supporting haters and being a hater are two different things. Some even argue that supporting Hitler doesn't make them a Nazi. In our current political climate, to speak out against hate invites intense reaction. Your willingness to step away from hate and to publicly step up to denounce it puts you in harm's way, and for this you are a hero in the truest sense of the word.

Naidoo is not my favourite person but my perception of him is being mollified over time and I think he has been consistent over the years, if somewhat toned down of late from his earlier militancy. The underlying message is that the age of the bad corporate is coming to an end (maybe, maybe not) because people are kind of waking up to it now and as soon as they realise their united power in financially crippling the bad guys it's over. Maybe the advent of the Internet and the invasion of privacy has an upside - the information overload is such that CAs, and everyone else, are going to be held to account to higher standards.

Sufferers of PUSSYS often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, the delusion that they are the majority, sudden & prolonged bouts of self-pity coupled w/inexplicable feelings of euphoria followed by uncontrollable whining. PUSSYS is characterized by a persistent unwillingness to see that Trump is a pathological liar put in office by Putin & is an illegitimate president. In moments of lucidity, they experience intense fear that Trump will be impeached. Research is ongoing, but PUSSYS appears to correlate closely w/some of the following factors: Conservatism, profound ignorance; excessive religiosity, NRA membership, living in isolated rural areas. PUSSYS is known to rapidly reproduce in red states.",

As long as he tweets and lies I make a killing. Keep him in the Whitehouse. My money is still on his lies.",

Limiting their ability to interact with the outside world or even know what's going on outside this very small and controlled environment.

All three have recanted or changed their stories at least once. Broaddrick and Willey testified, under oath, that Clinton never made unwanted advances. Witnesses, including Jones' own sister and BIL and six close friends of Willey's, stated that Willey and Jones had described their encounters with Clinton as consensual. Jones was exposed as a liar for saying Clinton's penis had a deformity, and Willey lied under oath repeatedly to Ken Starr's investigators.

How many of these protesting scientists are vegan?  Scientific facts show that the production and transportation of animal-based food has a much bigger carbon-footprint, land-footprint and water-footprint than the production & transportation of plant-based food.  Scientific studies have shown that the consumption of animal-based food is by far the single biggest contributor to human-generated climate change.  So how many of these scientists (who want governments and leaders to accept \"facts\" and change their behavior) are themselves not resisting scientific facts and changing their consumption behavior?  Not a whole lot. I am guessing.  So why criticize Trump or any one else who is skeptical?",
