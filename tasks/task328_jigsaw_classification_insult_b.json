IMO when you have a multi-billion dollar project where the vast majority of the costs are in external engineering and construction contracts; scrimping on internal staffing to save $2-3 million a year is literally the definition of being penny-wise, pound foolish.

Heinz, and PT Barnum also didn't pay back their creditors. But you're so much of a fool, that all you can do is repeat other people's lame rhetoric.

I wish there wasn't racism in Canada but she has added to it with her bigotry and divisiveness.  One good thing about the Halifax incident is that bookers of shows and festivals can now decide if Pimienta's talent outweighs her unpleasantness and potential for creating conflict.  (Ironically, she wants to tour Europe, the source of horrible white people.)  I happen to be white but know so many brown people as cousins, friends and fine co-workers that I think I know why there hasn't been an outpouring of denunciations of Pimienta's back-of-the-bus-ism from people \"of colour\".

The most Germans actually believed the lies. Our right wing's total disregard for facts and/or truth, ie. your claiming Clinton is guilty of espionage, murder, etc. or the President is an undercover agent for ISIS, created an uncontrollable Cheetos monster.  You helped create this monster, the monster is eating the GOP one big bite at a time, using the same half truths and flat out lies your right wing radio has been spouting.  You cannot blame anyone else but yourself.  Whistling racism to the white trash have brought you where you are.  I'm sure you will have a voice at the convention in Cleveland.

News Flash - Anchorage has a long history of violent crime. While some years are worse than others, it's naïve to think that we were all safe until all these new people showed. Anchorage's population is actually declining I believe and I'd be willing to bet that the majority of the violent crimes are committed by people who were born or raised here. Most have long rap sheets with the APD before their crimes become big enough to make the front page. I grew up out of state and have lived here for 13 years. Anchorage is a lot more violent than where I grew up. Maybe it's time we admitted that we have a violent crime problem and it's caused by Alaskans so we can start trying preventative measures  instead of continually blaming the outsiders.",

It's a monotonous, incredibly unhealthy hysteria, like some sickly liberal chant, which started just before Trump's inauguration and continues.\n\nThe left has basically lost all sight into what is civilized parody vs. parody of the banal, monstrous kind. It's not surprising that an everyday lewd, potty-mouthed comedian like Kathy Griffin, popular with progressive liberals of course, but someone who competes in her trade by taking comedic sewage to ever lower Hellish levels, would be the one to have zero reservations in thinking that this was a perfectly legitimate public act. Wow.\n\nGood to see her career destroyed by her own hand. Who's next?",

She chose to attack a bill that was passed with strong bipartisan support in 2004 that made it harder for violent parents to continue to harm their former partners and children.  This bill went through every committee and every vote unanimously.  As anyone following the legislature knows, this is extraordinary.  It is a bill that has literally saved lives and enabled victims to move forward with healthier lives, yet Munoz decided on the basis of one aggrieved dad who violated restraining orders to try to reverse 12 years of progress.

There were never funds available for needed expansion in Bethel or Nome. The desire was to get prisoners out of the Private prisons in AZ and Colorado. That was accomplished. One might argue that we should have left them there- or refused to build the prison unless it was located in South Palmer- but not that there was a pot of money for rural expansion that had been redirected somehow to Goose Creek.

Zille is reaching retirement age, however she still has strong feeling for her beloved DA and wants it to succeed in 2019. So what do they need? Musi needs to show that he is not a puppet in a substantial way, what better white person to take in hand and berate than Helen? However Helen mindful of her legacy needs something that will create a big enough stir, but at the same time will not unduly affect her long term legacy, hence the colonialism tweets. Once that had been set up Helen has to appear to be fighting for her life, in order to make the story appear credible. The end result. All win, Helen sees DA win in 2019 and Musi is not called a white mans puppet.\nMy five cents worth.",

We evaluate our kids' friends, sometimes forbidding them to associate with those who exert a bad influence.  We discriminate by evaluating our friends of the opposite sex, and eventually choose one for a spouse.  In the US, we discriminate by not allowing anyone who was not born here to become president. \n\nEven the Godhead has role distinctions.

They try to beat or force things/people, etc., to go along with the way they want things to go.  They have difficulty seeing all the things that could go wrong, so they don't plan for too many things that could go  bad.  Women generally do plan for the worst and hope for the best.

Don't you think the benefit of saving more lives is worth adding a few inconveniences (read: NOT bans, NOT confiscation) for gun owners? Which is more important here?\n\nYou also need to remember that life in America has not been the same for every class of people. You look back and think \"the good ol' days\" but many people look back and fear those times. \n\nI'm for the values you state, but not at the expense of vulnerable populations among us. Those shared values should unite us all and not favor a single denomination or religion. We should be able to come together with our differences in tact.",

Also, given that real estate now costs several multiples more of typical salaries than it did then, amassing a down payment is FAR harder to do, so the spaces that can realistically be bought are not necessarily ideal for long-term use/ family planning. In addition, real estate/construction in some provinces has exploded to comprise a far larger % of GDP than the past. Buying/selling desirable land is the biggest engine in Canada's economy. High prices have been engineered through interference/policy and the deal is steadily more raw for young people. How long can this go on?

The sentence was so extreme that the man could have killed the girl and received less of a sentence.  That to me represents a very serious mental illness on the part people who value sexuality above life itself.  So you are correct if you say that I believe that American attitudes which devalue life itself are ill advised.  There must be some perspective on severity of transgressions.  Those who drive drunk and kill would get a sentence substantially less than 29 years.  Those who drive drunk and paralyze others for life would get a shorter sentence than 29 years.

That is, hurricanes originate where the air in the center of the column is originally very nearly still, e.g., in the calm air in the doldrums.  If there is a strong wind constantly blowing the top off the heated air, a hurricane won't form.\n.\nOnce the chimney is established, why does the air swirl in a helix?\n\nThis is not the right place for an explanation of conservation of angular momentum and coriolis force.  The gist of it is that it swirls for the same reason that water in a toilet bowl swirls.  The wind speed is highest near the core for the same reason that a figure skater spins faster when they hold their arms closest to their body.\n\n(Continued)",

ANC uses the low end of that.\nAlso, note that the EPA's mission is different from the CDC - and they EXPLICITLY deal with that in answer #4.  That's why you get your conclusion of the EPA seems \"to allow\" fluoridation rather than actively support it.  The EPA cannot promote that addition of ANY substance to pure water as per their overall mandate.  In short, the EPA's overall purpose is to set maximal acceptable values on what CAN be our water (air, food, etc.)  The CDC/HHS has a much different and more proactive mandate about public health.\nPut simpler still: \nEPA = limits on bad things for us, \nCDC = EPA + what can we do/add that is GOOD for us?

The USFS and the Telluride Mountain Club are working closely together to do so. 2. The route was not established \"under the cover of darkness\" to hide an \"illegal masterpiece\". It was established by rock climbers in the same spirit that every other rock climb in America has been established. A climber has a vision of a route that he/she thinks would be worthy and installs it to the best of their ability. Noone at that time envisioned the popularity of the route. We are now working backwards to permit this thing and are happy the USFS are interested in that as well. 3. Rockfall is the biggest hazard up there, wear a helmet. \n\nAn engineering report and study are almost complete and we will begin working with the USFS engineers this winter in hopes of a clear path towards permitting next season.

I really do not see either side giving ground or changing way of thinking. Let's frame PERS with a different thought process, keep paying out as it is now and state will just keep running up a bigger unfunded mandate. Say no to all tax increases across-the-board state, county, cities, school districts, fire districts everything. Unlike the federal government the state can not just run a deficit. The state will at some point declare bankruptcy, this is the key to problem. All contracts then can be voided, leaving all PERS recipients with not a penny to their retirement.",

No doubt he has already instructed his new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, to appeal the decision directly to the Supreme Court. The outcome of that appeal will depend - in Trump's mind - on whether the high court is run by justices or so-called justices. \n\nHe might even wait until his nomination of Gorsuch is ratified by Congress to stack the deck a little in his favour. And while Gorsuch has taken a dim view of Trump's denigration of the judges - calling it 'disheartening and demoralizing' - he is a self-proclaimed originalist. He believes America's quarter-century old constitution should be interpreted literally which, of course, warms the cockles of conservative hearts all over America.",

Ted Koppel's statement was right on....\"Trump has made ideology more important than the facts.\"  Sadly for American people that the White House has lost all credibility.  Trump probably doesn't view his false statements as \"lies.\"  He considers his miss-statements as a negotiation technique to \"gain the advantage of the deal.\"  He's done this all his life so it is second nature to him.  He could get away with it in his business but not when all of American and the world is witness to his antics.  It's becoming embarrassing to \"watch the Emperor with no clothes,\"",

In fact employees pension money went back to the state government. As to the amount, if you work 30 years, you get 33-34 percent of the average of your \"highest three years of employment\". Only enogh to live on, somewhere else, if you combine it with social security.  Employees were paying the state to work for it.

When you start needing to go to Point C, D, and E in the same day 5 days a week or if you live more than a mile away from the Rail station, it isn't practical for use by many families.  Also, rail has already increased the cost of goods and services that I receive and it's called the GET, so I don't understand your point.  They still haven't figured out how to pay for the Operations and Maintenance of the rail system either which will also further increase the costs of goods and services.

These sources provided an understanding of the early Church as a communion of local Churches, with the bishop as the focus of unity, sharing a common faith but with a certain diversity of practice in a society that was largely pagan. Discovery of documents from the early patristic period in the late 19th-C contributed to a renewed understanding of the episcopate necessitating a re-evaluation of the relationship between bishops and in particular the bishop of Rome. It meant that the pyramidal model employed since the Constantinian era was no longer an authentic representation, a flatter model with more equivalence between local churches was opted for with renewed emphasis on scripture (paraphrase)",

Many of them attend to the growing evidence that social determinants of health are crucial.

I support early intervention, proactive measures.  Mental illness tends to be progressive if untreated and the earlier individuals receive help, the more effective that assistance can be.  I'd be very happy to meet with you anytime to discuss ideas relating to community-based programs and facilities: 16 bed community residential facilities; walk-in clinics; crisis center/evaluation-stabilization short term care facilities; mobile crisis teams (Cahoots, etc) and professional intervention specialists deployed in the community.  These measures would tremendously benefit the \"homeless mentally-ill\" you reference.  Closing the JC Hospital would \"free up\" tens of millions to address such programs.

Ok, you apologize and pay for the window and  perhaps move your \"ballfield.\" \n\n  However (and it's a big however), if you INTENTIONALLY break that window, you have committed a crime; a far different and more serious act than accidentally breaking a window.  Intent impacts the judgment of acts in a legal sense and, IMO, it should impact our judging the morality or immorality of an act.

Banning the use of cellphones while crossing city and state streets would certainly help.  As for intersection design, that is more of a science than an art.  Both the cities and state follow the Uniform Manual on Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), a federal guideline which specifies when certain treatments (such as no turning movements and Barnes Dances) should be used.  Research on Barnes Dances shows they work incredibly well in some locations and horribly in others.

When you are trying to achieve a goal you have access to multiple levers. A good person with a gun will not cause harm. A bad person with a less effective weapon is limited in the damage they can cause. A bad person with the best weapon but no one to use it on cannot cause harm. So if your goal is to reduce harm you can try to craft any of those situations.\n\nThe problem with 'looking at the type of person' is that there are 323 million people in the US. For absolutely anything illegal (e.g. drugs) you can find a large minority of people who could handle it responsibly. The statement '[Blank] doesn't [blank], people [blank].' applies to absolutely everything. But in all other things we recognize that public policy cannot be tuned to an individual level.

I do agree that it's alarming that traffic fatalities have risen in Co, but let's not rush to assume that is due to the legalization of marijuana.  Perhaps it's due to increased population in Co, and crowded roads?  The reason more people test positive for MJ is because it has been legalized for personal use in CO.

The fact that we spend more than 4x the amount of actual damages to try to prevent suits says a lot.\n\nFrankly, I've always doubted the \"defensive medicine\" argument anyway.

It is a federal crime so maybe they went to jail. In Hawaii where I live in the winter they changed the \"squatter\" law and the absent homeowner can call the cops even if they are not there and tell the cops to evict the squatters without going to court.
