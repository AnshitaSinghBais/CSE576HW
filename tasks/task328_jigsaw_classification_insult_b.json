More importantly though, is the second point which is that Donald Trump has made a career out of ripping people off, and there is a long trail of bankruptcies, lawsuits, unpaid workers, and stiffed contractors in his wake as proof. Trump University is just the tip of the iceberg. Donald Trump has indeed amassed quite a fortune, but his principle tactic is patent dishonesty.

Lyndon Johnson was a Texas Dixiecrat and known bigot who nevertheless nurtured and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which killed Jim Crow, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which largely ended black voter disenfranchisement, primarily in the South.

Congress (republicans) allocated $4.3 billion in the 2016 budget for exactly what the State Department did with the money.  The $4.3 billion was allocated to spend on economic development, climate, and other State Department initiatives.  In case you've been paying attention to politics, this is exactly how budgets work.  Republicans can put money in a budget without ever saying it's for Global Warming, but for State Department initiatives.  That way they can fool their dumber-than-dump MAGAphant voters and support what they know is real - Climate Change.  Only you and Fox News remain adamantly stupid on all these points.

Elway has never fooled around and goofed off when it came to football. He makes his decisions and he expects a player to give 100% effort just like any GM does. It's obvious that Lynch wasn't setting the world on fire like Sloter did. It's all about mental toughness from your number 1 position. So far I don't think anyone can say that Siemian isn't showing this toughness. We all saw it from Sloter. We caught a few glimpses of it from Osweiler in his first starts as a Bronco.Can't say that Lynch has shown any signs yet, but to be fair he has pretty high expectations. Sometimes players lose that mental edge and hard to get it back in focus. In my eyes Lynch lost confidence when it wasn't happening and coming together for him. We'll see if Owsweiler can answer the bell if he gets called upon. I liked Osweiler, but I knew that I didn't want Elway to overpay. Houston was pretty dumb.",

The closer you get to the GTA the worse it becomes....but even rural regions require diligent attention.\n\nFree Hint: always have 3 OUTS everytime you are within 25 yds of another car either coming or going. Intentionally driving into the ditch is absolutely one of them. For the other 2 OUTS take a course to learn.

But here is my question: If Trump's tax plan turns out to benefit him, should we jettison it no matter what? If it hurts Trump, should we accept it no matter what? How about if it is neutral for Trump? It seems to me we should judge any tax plan on whether it is good or bad for the country as a whole, rather than for a specific individual, even if he is the one proposing it. The Democrat's statement of not even considering any tax plan until Trump releases his taxes is therefore nothing but a stalling tactic, knowing they don't have the votes to get their way. They are blatant obstructionists, and having spent the last several years accusing the Republicans of doing the same, they are also hypocrites. Big ones.",

Maybe the next one, like the current one, will only do away with freedoms that I enjoy, so it won't matter to you and you can go on being a PROUD American. But when they get around to taking away the freedoms you consider valuable, then you'll protest.\n\nBut there will likely be nobody left with any actual freedom to act to take those freedoms back. While you bargain away freedoms for security, remember ... once they're gone, it takes the blood of patriots & tyrants to get them back. Better not to bargain them away in the first place.",

It's the use of an extreme example to drive home an reasonable principle. Here's a more palatable example: the \"white lie\". The person who thinks intention is the dominant factor in moral action would say that a white lie is morally fine because your intention is to spare someone's feelings or make them feel good. Solid intention but doesn't change the nature of the moral act which is speaking falsehood.

There will be war of course. But this is no longer the 20th century where American military power can impose with impunity.\n\nUnder Trump I can say there will not be a single other country who will join in any of his war of aggression.

Retailers exploit the public's desire for low prices. \n\nThere were two reasons why CPR's American contractor Andrew Onderdonk (not PM McDonald) hired Chinese :  He couldn't hire enough whites.  2. It was a business decision. \"By 1881 Onderdonk was short of ...money. He solved his problems by hiring Chinese men at low wages.

Unions bargain collectively for pay raises and better benefits, a force more powerful than an individual employee trying to seek out a raise on their own behalf.  Your point about low wages  is more likely to do with the fact that of Hawaii's heavy reliance on Tourism as the number 1 driver of economy.  Tourism jobs are low paying by nature - servers, housekeepers, bellmen, etc.. Compare that to a place like Washington State where tech is a key driver of the economy.

The Court held by ONE vote that adding toxic waste was an ADMINISTRATIVE decision, thereby taking that Right from those People - it's the same reason that made it legal for the City Council to ignore the popular vote in Dec. 2015 and keep that poison in our water.

I figure if you park in the middle of the road or side of the road to take a picture, the cost is $250.00 for parking hazardously.   All they would have to do is keep the tickets pre written & just add a name & info to each because I always pass at least 10cars a day parked along the side of the road and someone is out of their car taking pictures or looking at the sights.

Since the topic has turned to beer, it seems appropriate to share one of his classic scientific explanations:\n\n\"Well ya see, Norm, it’s like this… A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That’s why you always feel smarter after a few beers.”\n\nWho could argue with such wisdom?",

From thick bristle to fine thread took all the efforts of scientists and everyone connected with the textile industry. In 1939 the first nylon-yarn spinning machine went into operation and on May 15, 1940 nylon hose went on sale and it was bedlam at every store.\"",

Is it possible it was for weather control, who can really say, given the alleged capability of very deep black programs to do unbelievable physics.  I would be one to not so easily dismiss this due to the exponential rise in science nowadays.  Perhaps the possibility of weather control would require a more scaled up facility (or perhaps they have figured out a way to miniaturize it?), with much greater power, such as a small nuclear reactor.  Could the place this facility in the boonies, such as the Nevada Test and Training range, it is certainly possible.

So maybe the President is not so much telling lies as the media is distorting his message for their own agenda.  Look at the words of columnist Krugman this week.

Then back it up by looking at the profitability as measured by return in capital as measured in cash terms and valuation by price to free cash flow. Avoid debt laden companies. Avoid story stocks hyped up on BNN like Timminco. Invest in an industry which is immune to things you cannot predict. If you were not clever enough to predict the oil price decline in 2014 why are you in oil stocks in a big way? Buy something with a good dividend you can live on (over 3.5%) and a dividend growth rate above inflation. Check the dividend cover against free cash flow and earnings.

In fact, most inmates look younger after their sentences has expired. These isolated cases in this piece are exaggerated, And it appears to me that the experts at the conference where quoting examples from reports and not face to face interviews or observations. Not to say that living in prison is a holiday, it clearly isn't, but  the reality is that for most offenders in Canada if their have reached the point of being incarcerated they have done little to reduce their risk factors which resulted in their conviction.

They cause massive backups during busy times of the day, as other drivers have noted, as they do not allow in any way for breaks in traffic from the prevailing direction during times of heavy traffic volume.  Moreover, each one is necessarily unique in its construction and traffic flow, unlike a conventional intersection, making them inherently confusing for a fair percentage of drivers, no matter how long they have been in place.  On top of that, roundabouts are wasteful of fuel, as they cause EVERYONE going through them to come to a near-complete or total stop.",

For insurance to work effectively you need to have a larger, rather than smaller, pool of enrollees. Why? because a large pool of insured guarantees that you will have a mix of the old and sick along with the young and healthy. That's the only way insurance can work. Otherwise, only those who have an immediate need will enroll and the cost of paying for their medical bills will bankrupt the insurance company. In a healthy market, these people are indirectly subsidized by the young and healthy who pay premiums but have very low actual medical costs. And, don't forget that even the young and healthy can suffer medical catastrophes. Finally, when Klein writes \"if there were functional markets where healthier individuals could purchase cheaper insurance\" he seems to misunderstand ObamaCare, which allows insurance companies to charge the older 3 times more than they charge the young.",

It became a project funded solely by the state and Federal DOT has virtually laughed at the traffic projections based on the public bridge between Juneau and Douglas which is the sole link for them.  Yet the Knik project lives  on, destroying the Government Hill neighborhood, paying salaries, and as far as I know has no plan to link any bridge traffic to Anchorage roads.  I have heard the line \"We have too much invested at this point to stop now\" repeatedly since the pre-pipeline years.

Unless the oil/ gas demand goes away, which I doubt for the foreseeable future, we, and other producing countries, will keep producing, transporting, and selling it - simple as that.\n\nThe ecos like you would be better to try to convince companies to invest in green energy, rather than putting your fingers in the end of a pipeline.

This is a democracy, and the democratically elected government of Canada (not Vancouver) has approved this pipeline, like it or not. Protest away, legally.

That's why they're court-ordered. Medical and psychological \"treatment\" programs have huge failure rates -- almost double that of 12 Step programs. Having experience with the treatment programs through working in mental health, I believe its because they don't give the addict anything to replace the drugs with except will-power and cognitive exercises.

State government funding has been cut what? 20 to 25 % over the last few years. Last year we citizens ponied up about half of scheduled PFD payments. We've drawn down savings (to pay for government services) to pathetically low levels. The budget is still in major deficit. Cutting, at least temporarily, oil tax credits is a must.

It's a profitable investment -it MAKES money, it doesn't COST money. The tax revenue gains from ensuring everyone with the talent to get a degree CAN get a degree alone will be at least 7 times the cost of their degrees (this is based on international averages - in South Africa, being a poor country, it will be HIGHER as we have a greater shortage of graduates and so greater benefits when we produce more).\n\nIt also brings down expense. Everybody uses government services (from sewage to roads) but only the middle class and up pays to FUND those services.

However, strict constructionist judges have proven far more willing to allow states to impose restrictions on abortion, such as ultrasounds, which I believe have been key to some of the reduction we appear to be seeing.  However, the stronger argument is internationally.  The Mexico City policy, which was created by President Reagan, prevented US dollars from supporting abortion abroad.  It was reversed by Clinton and Obama, but upheld by both George H. W. and George W. Bush.   Paying for abortion abroad likely has a more immediate impact than anything done domestically.   Thus if Mr. Trump reimposes the Mexico City policy, I would see this as a major win.  But like you, I will need to wait and see, and offer lots of prayer in the meantime.  God bless.",

The rail viaduct has been constructed as far as Aloha Stadium, a distance of about ten miles.  It should be obvious that a lot of time, effort and money was spent designing the project, right?  Well, maybe not.  A new contract was awarded in July 2016 for the Stadium to Middle Street section.  It is a design-build contract for $875 million (without change orders).  DESIGN and build.   Construction was expected to begin within six months of contract award, which would have been January 2017, but it has not yet started.  Why weren’t the designs for the East Kapolei to Aloha Stadium section used instead of paying to redesign the stadium to Middle Street section?

Others also promoted the Governor's positions and, therefore, it was not just Ariyoshi himself trying to sell his position. \n\nGovernor Ige could benefit from a more enthusiastic cheering crowd that will take up his message and promote it in different tones and volumes.

In fact it's not even quite correct to call them 'sources,' e.g. PV solar in Germany, with similar insolation as western Washington, was shown recently to be a net energy sink, with an EROI of less than one (consuming more energy than it creates), similar to ethanol.  Let's not enact legislation that sends us down that road again.\n\nAt the very least we should be sure that the social cost of carbon isn't actually negative.  The planet is currently greening, at least in part due to higher CO2 levels, and that's likely to be a benefit.  The notion that we should pay now to avoid paying later is based generally on our current understanding of the climate, which is primitive, and specifically on climate models, which are even more primitive.",

Either way, the cat was the definitive host (original source) of Tg infections in both wildlife and humans.  The only place the parasite completes its sexual reproduction is in the gut of a cat.  When the cat is infected and shedding the Tg oocycsts, as single cat sheds millions of oocysts in its feces, which can wash into the water and ocean.  Cats are NOT just the vector, but in fact the definitive host of the Tg parasite.  A single oocyst can infect a pig, and a human.  A single cat can infect millions of other animals.

What's illegal is to drive \"intoxicated.\"  The Alaska Supreme Court has held that \"intoxicated\" means \"impaired\"--which isn't very explanatory.  As a practical matter, it means above o.o8% BA.  Nobody alive can tell just by how much he's drunk or how he feels at the moment whether he's above or below that limit.

Many Bernie Sanders supporters did not vote for Hilary Clinton because of her strong support for the right wing of Israeli politics, thanks to huge financial contributions from Zionists like Haim Saban and Sheldon Edelson, A women's right to abortion is of course very important for any women's movement, but close to three million people marched on Saturday for a  lot more than just that.

It seems extremely arbitrary, and reminds me of what they used to say of the Court of Equity, i.e. that justice in that Court \"was as long as the Chancellor's foot\". I would love to have an uninterested third party review the rejected ones and point out just how they are \"uncivil\".  I have written to the Globe but have not had the courtesy of a response. Alas, there seems no further appeal.\nAnyway,  my point was that, understanding decisions in the context of the times they were made, rather than applying the morals of the present, just seems like common sense--unless you expect our ancestors, unlike us, to have been prescient.\nAlthough no different, I await the Chancellor's decision whether this comment is also \"uncivil\".",

If you rub people the wrong way, say the wrong things at the wrong time, don't understand how to build relationships and lack empathy, you will not succeed.  As a sales professional for over 30 years, I live and breath EI every day.  Many colleges and universities are now seeing the benefits of EI and it's starting to become part of their curriculum.  Emotional intelligence is still in its infancy, only being discovered about 30 years ago by Reuven Bar-On who began developing the precursor to Emotional Quotient Inventory EQ-i.  This is a game changer and if you are not fully aware about this, I highly recommend you look into it.  There's an abundance of information available on this most important topic.  IQ get you hired.  EQ gets you promoted.",

I just find it a little unfair sometimes. I know these refugees have been through a lot in war-torn country. But 5 kids with no jobs. C'mon!",

But a large number of friends, neighbours and relatives, all affluent and educated, with many being really wealthy, still had no idea what to do on Friday, so they all ended up staying in their homes. Worse, they didn't even get together with their families, and many left  80-year old mothers and grandmothers alone in their homes. We're also now discovering many don't have flood insurance, which is astounding. I now realize my immediate family is very different from most of our friends, relatives and acquaintances.

You are very wrong, however, in saying that \"Destroy the priest, destroy the sacrifice.\"  No one is suggesting either of those things, but that the current concepts of 'priest' are derived from an outdated, failing and misogynist system of belief.  The Mass will always be the central act of worship and belief for Catholics (and others), but the format will be changed once again and then again still.  With the numbers of ordained men and those entering formation dwindling ever so constantly, it seems that the Holy Spirit is doing the work the Church has not yet had the guts to do for itself.  It is not really \"destruction,\" as you fear, but it is very much \"renewal.\"  Like that old saying: is the glass half empty or half full?",

(Question:  Should \"legislative per diem\" be given to help a legislator accumulate equity in real property?) \n\nIt's interesting to know a reason why LeDoux prevented a reasonable bill concerning smoke-free workplaces, favored by the vast majority of Alaskans but not Stutes, to move out of her committee. LeDoux killed the bill, but probably made Stutes and her husband real happy. Leading to the question ... who does LeDoux represent? Certainly not Muldoon! Vote her out!!",
