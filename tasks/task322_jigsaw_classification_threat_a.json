The guy ought to be — and I’m not for the death penalty — so, if I’m not for the death penalty, there’s only one way to do it, illegally shoot the son of a bitch.”",

How about we provide a nice place for stock brokers and politicians to do coke? (we have them, they are called strip clubs). \n\nOne of my brothers was in the hospital for three months after a car accident during which time he became addicted to morphine. Once he left the hospital ya know what he did? He quit taking drugs! He toughed it out and got clean, despite the fact the doctors were all too willing to prescribe him a truckload of pills. \n\nHeroin users are useless junkies who have given up on life. Let them die.

He did his time but my daughter has done 23 years of time, she got a f*&$ing life sentence. Don't you tell me he did his time over and over again these bastards get out and do it again. I say kill them all. I like this guy too. I wanted to kill the pervert that hurt my child but as a parent I needed to be here to help my daughter get the help she needed. Don't think killing him didn't cross my whole families mind. Screw them stop keeping them in jail and use that money to help the innocent children that are being hurt.

Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis. If courts jailed a few bishops, that might help a lot, too.",

There's some kind of hidden agenda that she is trying to protect.  So, until the Prime Minister decides to keep his election promise, FPTP it is.

The ridiculous category of \"unlawful combatant,\" invented by the Americans, deprived the people they were shooting at of any kind of rights of war at all. Their options were to be killed, or to be put in Guantanamo to be tortured.  You may want to believe that this boy, surrounded by older family members guiding his every step, is guilty of being a mature Al Qaida, but that doesn't make him a murderer. I feel great sympathy for the families of the soldier who was killed, and for the soldier who was blinded, but I honestly cannot see how their target needs to compensate them for shooting back.",

And the few whites who had family \"connections\".\nSo I'm tired hearing Hawaii people b1tch about race this and race that. Sure, we are the only true melting pot in the world, but during many, many times in the history of our own stew brewing, have we seen different ingredients resist the blending for extended periods.\nSo come off your high horse about old white dudes being racist. You really afraid of that frail old fool? I'm more affraid of young dark racists who control media...",

Other denominations followed suit. Eventually, Protestant denominations nominally abandoned their involvement in education. That this was done only nominally is well expressed, for example, by Egerton Ryerson's words (he spearheaded the 1846 School Act), who believed that it was part of the Government's mandate to be a social agency forming children in a 'uniform, common, Protestant culture,' regardless of their individual family backgrounds. He, and like minded people pushed for funding for Protestant schools from publicly collected taxes as opposed to charitable donations. Thus, they became 'public schools'. Catholics kept their schools. Eventually the 1867 British North America Act, primarily because of Quebec, guaranteed 'public funding' also for Catholic schools.\n\nSince then many things have changed, but anti-Catholic sentiments persist.",

It is one thing to be “firm, trusting in the Lord.”  It is something else to be self-righteous, prattling on and on about how sanctimonious one is.  “Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man (hierarchs and minions) . . . teach the way of God in accordance with the truth” and the truth is murder, not credit.  The altar silence is deafening.  Liturgy of the Word, Reading 354, Tuesday of the Ninth Week of Easter I.",

He was Executive Director of the Goldwater Institute. His choice of title (and cover design) were quite deliberate.  He is very conservative on economic issues, but he is pro-immigration - sees immigrants as one of our nation's strengths (I agree), and supports a path to legal residency/citizenship.  He has been slammed by the extreme right for using the Goldwater legacy - he is just a \"slimey liberal\" in their minds, not worthy to call himself a follower of Goldwater. These commentators - even though right-wing - obviously know as little about Goldwater (beyond all the hype from decades ago) as they do about Flake. He didn't wait to speak out like Corker did.",

What I see his problem is that he has a lack of cheerleaders around him, shoring up his leadership message for the state. Many have compared Ige to Ariyoshi, and those comparisons are quite accurate. However, for Ariyoshi, he had a team of voices around him that would also promote the state administrations positions in various ways - from the guiding hand of Inouye to the more enthusiastic ways of Waihee and Cayetano. Others also promoted the Governor's positions and, therefore, it was not just Ariyoshi himself trying to sell his position. \n\nGovernor Ige could benefit from a more enthusiastic cheering crowd that will take up his message and promote it in different tones and volumes.

Those can be discussed, whether taxpayers should have to financially contribute to MEDICALLY-NECESSARY procedures.\n\nBut if the reason for an abortion is that \"I've been careless with my contraception and don't want to have a kid\" then the woman seeking that abortion is committing murder and taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for that.\n\nWhy would we object to participating in such a \"compassionate\" enterprise? Because it's murder and, if we're paying for it (even against our will), we're guilty of that murder.",

The sex abuse scandal that erupted in the 90's has not changed things.  I have seen abusing priests moved to new parishes where they can re-offend.   I have seen abusers quietly asked to leave, while their superiors write letters of recommendations for them as they seek new employment in Institutions where they are again likely to abuse.  The Church says one thing about their intention to listen to victims, provide restitution, be watchful for prospective abusers, protect the vulnerable, etc. but, their actions speak much louder than their words as you outline above. \n\nThank you for trying!

Thus, a loaded semi causes 9,600 times as much damage as the average car.  Car owners are clearly subsidizing truck owners.

Territories then belonged to rulers, not the populations who lived there, that concept would come later with democracy. The populations came with the territory, nobody asked them for their opinion.\n\nThen the new rulers had to decide what to do with the populations. Some assimilated easily, others did not. The Acadians were deported, the rest of the French colonists could not be so easily disposed of, so some accommodations were made, and more negotiated over time, which allowed enough political and cultural autonomy for that parallel culture to survive and even thrive in Quebec. \n\nSeparatism today comes from those descendants of the original colonists who refuse to accept  the present political structures and want their own country, and those are a  minority.",

When our students are not educated to an acceptable standard, then they as a whole will not be as successful in this competitive world. When Alaska has a bunch of poorly educated people in the state, our standard of living will decline, others will come in and take the better jobs, and Alaska will suffer with more social and welfare issues. Yes, a quality education costs a lot, but it is an investment in an asset for a community, not a liability. It pays back in capable people who can work, innovate, and contribute to a stronger economy for all. So even those without children in the home but still paying taxes, you are still benefitting. Long term investments are often difficult to see, but the rewards will be worth it for Anchorage and all of Alaska. Remember: a school is not your enemy.",

The vast majority of children adopted between new born and 4-years-old are adopted within or less than a year after they're removed from their home.

Perhaps this is a typical mistake, of thinking Vincent started first with \"religious\" orders. In fact he did not and even the Daughters and Congregation of the Mission, founded in 1625 were not founded as religious orders but as active groups, not bound by cloister or other religious order rules. This year we are celebrating the 400th anniversary of that original foundation of the Vincentian charism. Over 9000 Vincentians of all kinds(including lay St. Vincent de Paul  founded by Blessed Frederic Ozanam) will gather in Rome October 14 -16 for a symposium and Pope Francis will address us.

The only thing difficult about dismissing a CO who has used excessive force, was negligent, or \"unduly familiar\" with inmates is that labor arbitrators tend to be sheltered lawyers and intellectuals who get freaked out by the jail environment and decide that the CO couldn't be expected to behave well in that environment, so they'll give you some discipline but they'll put the CO back to work, but you still have discipline on the book and you can get the CO to act right or you can get him/her again.

I won't say that unions didn't have influence over the management of PERS/TRS, but the State has never bargained retirement benefits with unions beyond whether or not the union was in PERS or its own plan.   In the early days the State's objective was to get unions into PERS/TRS rather than their own plans because they had more control.   State employee wages and benefits, something I actually know something about, unlike you, are not based on the price of oil.   Oil revenue may dictate how many employees the State has, but its effect on what they are paid is indirect.   Tier I PERS dates back to 1961, when the only State employees who were unionized were the Marine Hwy. employees, who had their own union-run pensions.   I paid what the State asked for my PERS benefit; you can cut it when you can pry it from my cold dead fingers.",

If Trump and Co. say hateful, horrible things, if they threaten hateful, horrible actions, believe them. Second thing is treat people like adults. Treat people with respect. Do not condescend to them, which means hold them accountable for the consequences of their actions and demand that they behave like citizens. We elected Trump, you know, don't think, oh, they just didn't know what they where doing. Third is refuse to accept what's going on as the new normal. People may evoke nuance, they may argue quite reasonably that some of the things that this administration does - it may not be so terrible, that some of the executive orders that they make may be quite good. All that is possible, but I don't believe that this is a political challenge but rather a moral crisis.",

A state park is named for him, a bronze bust of his image watches over the state Capitol, and a grandiose monument of him resides at his grave in Memphis. But his most gripping presence may be along Interstate 65, running through Nashville, where there’s a can’t-miss-it statue of Forrest—he’s atop a horse, with a sword in his right hand, a pistol in his left, surrounded by Confederate flags. Forrest was a Tennessee-born lieutenant general in the Confederate Army; after the Civil War ended, he focused his energy on the Ku Klux Klan, which anointed him its first grand wizard. The 25-foot fiberglass statue was created by lawyer and sculptor Jack Kershaw, who is best known for being among the string of lawyers hired to defend James Earl Ray, the convicted assassin of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nRacism is found in the eyes of the Confederate HOLDERs.",

While children are not a focus of some marriages, they are a focus of most marriages, especially during the 20 years or so it requires to raise a child. When a marriage fails or never even occurs and children are involved, it is a great moral failing of their parents with lifelong and even inter-generational consequences to them and their own offspring. More than any other factor it effects their income prospects and their likelyhood of having their own successful marriage. So while all the aspects Brooks mentions are crucial in choosing a good and lasting spouse, if children are expected to ever be a part of a family, that marital commitment must also be built around the children's needs and can be a great source of strength in maintaining marital commitment through difficult times.\n\nGoogle \"importance of marriage to children.\"",

Perhaps we also had and still have our own psychological (bad apple) issues that need addressing, something we may not want to admit. I know I do. So, easier to blame the organisation (the barrell) than blame individuals (bad apples).

When I learned to drive, the rule was that you are responsible for your own vehicle and must always be prepared to be able to make an emergency stop. This judgement seems to suggest that you can blame somebody else for your own lack of control of your vehicle.

And that is exactly what I was taught.  And not one of the teachers even blinked and said sorry to tell you this but this is the rule.  There was some sort of delight almost in imposing suffering by climbing into bed with people and telling them what they could and could not do.

One, non theological, reason for that choice was that most of them were sick to the back teeth of dealing with every right wing crank in their own country, who were complaining to them on a daily or weekly basis about Bishops and priests not applying the letter of the law, as they thought they should be.\n\nYou might get an idea of what the Cardinals were relentlessly subjected to from this site 😉",

Plus (maybe I'm preaching to the choir but) there are numerous other benefits from local ag that are not easily quantified such as rural development, economic development, community development, cultural preservation, preservation of green spaces, etc.",

Maybe the young priest bought a saturno and the cape but walks or takes the bus and that is his only indulgence? We don't really know. As Our Lord told us \"Stop judging by appearances, but judge justly.\" (John 7:24)",

They also must wish to kill any and all dissent.That is un-American at it's core. Civilized disagreement is a cornerstone of our nation. It's really a damn shame and sad also.

For comparsion about a year ago three students from Japan were speeding in a Nissan 350z, crashed, died & what their car looked like after the crash was a compacted metal cube.   Besides the obvious problem of the rail column too close to the roadway, as others pointed out putting a raised curb next to a highway is also a hazard.  Also what is the crash rating for the Scion and how come it caught fire in a crash that does not appear from extreme speed?

It's inaccurate and needlessly polemical, and does nothing to illuminate actual disagreements within the church. \n\nI am however disappointed that his tired-ness extends primarily, if not exclusively, to converts.  Given that the statement is zeroed in on a group (a monolithic group?) accusing someone of not being Catholic, one might reasonably infer that Winters suggests converts are not real Catholics themselves.  It would seem sufficient to say \"I am so tired of Catholics/anybody telling us that the pope is not Catholic.\"  If not, perhaps it behooves Mr. Winters to explain what is so specifically frustrating about converts.",

Gasoline at the pumps in Alberta with Carbon Tax included is cheaper now than in 2012 - mid 2015 prices.

The inexpensive goods were mostly machinery, production equipment rather than retail goods we the general public see in the stores such as Walmart. The companies import these goods to keep their costs down. If they increase to the level of the proposed tariffs, it will severely impact the liquidity access for these enterprises.\n\nBanks have covenants in place on their debt facilities that they extend to various businesses. If the cost of production and goods zip way up, it impacts the margins on the end product and the sellability of that product. What happens next is a credit review will be called under the debt agreement. If the defaults cannot be cured within the prescribed period a negative event will be called. The bank steps in and places the business in remediation review.\n\nIn other words, we will see more business failures. Jobs lost.",

Some of these beads in these toothpastes will end up being ingested. But will it cause great harm to the person? Seems to me that it is all an excuse to \"tax\" the population more.

The movement does not envisage rapprochement  among its members; rather both sides agree not to acknowledge or face or confront what they actually feel about each other. The Catholic element (conservative Catholics) do not relinquish for one moment their rejection of the core beliefs of the Fundamentalist element; and vice versa. Of particular importance in assessing E2 from a Catholic perspective is that a very significant portion of fellow Catholics (progressive, liberals) are as much the target of E2 rejection and enmity as a subset of secular ideologies.

It is certainly better than the pattern established under the previous two pontificates which saw witch hunts against gay people and a hardening of the church's position on LGTB issues. As an old person I'm comfortable with my church-going habits, but young people are not so ingrained in their habits. What they see, and what is true, is a church which teaches that gay people are somehow spiritually deformed and are therefore barred from various sacraments. To young people this is not acceptable. New Ways Ministry may provide some comfort to old gay Catholics like me, but young people aren't as impressed. Like most gay Catholics they want a change in doctrine.",

IF the worst happens though, I'd like to be prepared. We would retreat to a room that locks, where we'd locate the quicker-opening safe. I'll admit I am not a big fan of guns, but my husband has taken me out shooting a number of times, I've taken some safety courses, and I have surprised myself by being a pretty good shot. He's in charge of cleaning everything, because it is an involved process. I try not to go places where I feel like I would need to carry one, but if I had to (emergency, wilderness trip gone bad), I hope I'd be prepared. We don't take it lightly.",

This shows most readers of this paper view the world with a liberal tunnel vision; they vastly underestimate how much influence China wields in world affairs. Under Trump era, China, already being one of the most innovative economies supported by several indices,  is now de faco the leader of The Order, of the free world. If you find this hard to believe, you are an ignorant fool and should read the Economist, NYT, Foreign Affairs other than pieces written by Nathan, the ideologue. \n\nCanadian exports to China represents less than 5% of China's total import, and that number is decreasing. Talking about penalizing China economically is like saying an ant can throw a punch to an elephant. A 1.6 trillion USD economy does not hold economic stick against a 12 trillion USD economy. What a joke to talk about stopping trade and wishing to penalize China's wrong.",

We would then have enough revenue that we would not be taking dividends away from Alaskans and causing a recession.\n\nIn addition, we pay almost $1 billion in welfare to Big Oil.  Total madness.",
