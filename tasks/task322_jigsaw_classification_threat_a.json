Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis. If courts jailed a few bishops, that might help a lot, too.",

The main reasons, of course, are economic, which supports the point made in my original comment. As for the biblical analogy, Joseph and Mary travelled to Bethlehem to participate in a census. Subsequently, the bible holds that they fled to Egypt to escape King Herod's purge of newborn males, although later, after Herod died and the risk diminished, returned to Judah. They didn't seek permanent refuge in Egypt and thus don't provide an analogy to those who today seek to get to the West. In any case, many view the biblical stories as a series of parables, akin to moral lessons rather than actual history, while some see the bible as essentially heavily edited propaganda that was intended to suit the political interests of the early Christian church and its leaders. Today, it's mainly fundamentalists who promote literalist interpretations of the bible.",

In his group's analysis, about 70 percent of Clinton's failure to reach Obama's vote total in 2012 was because she lost these voters.\"\n\n\"His firm's conclusion is shared broadly by other Democrats who have examined the data, including senior members of Clinton's campaign and officials at the Democratic data and analytics firm Catalist.

The same will be true for the next one, and the next, and the next. Such is the horrific nature of terrorism.\n\nMerkel failed the leadership test and has been failing consistently for years.

Their income has never been crazy and they worked hard to afford what was then a moderately expensive house and live in what is now a stratospherically expensive house. But their income tax report would be wildly out of line with the value of the house - they could never afford the same thing today.

Some states exempt groceries while other exempt medical services. A few exempt purchases by non-residents.   All states have to exempt federal government purchases.  Meanwhile our legislators toss out the sales tax idea and give no information detailing even the fundamentals of what the tax would entail for residents.",

Since everyone now had to be paid the same, white employers fired their black workers and hired whites in their places. Williams neglected to point out that the actual reason for the blacks losing their jobs was racism, not the minimum wage.\n\nRD is reminding us of the truth of John Kenneth Galbraith's \"The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness\".

The complain arises from when negligible incidents turn lethal with a bunch of cops around. What's the ones last week. Two cops stuggling with a guy and then put guns to him and pop pop point blank. Once that chubby guy wen down they should have backed off and tazed. Or the guy lying in the street on his back, arms up, shot. \"uh, I don't know why\" replied the cop.

The folks are raising these question of priesthood while the institution is defending its position. To me the folks are the church and management is the institution. The folks, in general, do not have the institution's hangups on married or women priests. The folks will realize there is a shortage of priests when their individual personal needs, e.g. anointing, funerals, etc, cannot be met.

Even getting a proper dosage of medication takes a while to get it straight because each person is different and what may works for one, will not for another.

(Congress cutting off funding of the executive and thus shutting down the government would be an example.)\n\nAs in all large, complex public bureaucracies, the director does not lead or conduct investigations.

I agree with the goal, but not the assumption of knowing the best, or most effective, way to get there. Francis doesn't see himself as a \"dictator\" type, and seems most concerned with getting the Body of Christ to come back to life and fulfill its promise as a more decentralized Body than with other issues.

Services employment was flat as a jump in education services, likely reflecting shifting hiring patterns for teachers, was offset by a pullback in culture and recreation employment.\n- From RBC's Daily Economic Update",

There are some industrial transportation applications for gas hybrids but they will be phased out within the next decade as battery capacity greatly expands.

Gas is a 5 if coal is 10. \n\nBut anything for a buck to some.\nThe world's great minds and engineers are now developing super clean energy from sun, solar and wind,, which are not just \"a little bit cleaner\".  Some day fossil fuels will make up 10% of human's energy needs.

One time, in fact, in 1961  I was able to share my views on Viet Nam--  Our chaplain from our main base was scheduled to come give us a lecture on \"Why the US military should be in S.E. Asia.\" However, he couldn't make it up to Lubeck so just mailed us the informational material.  Well, our captain knew I liked to talk so he gave me the info and told me to do the lecture.  Having studied SE Asia earlier, I instead titled my talk as \"Why we should not be in S.E. Asia.\"  Result?     I  finally got my promotion to Spec 5.",

The plans they got were high deductible plans, often requiring the expense of thousands of dollars before they'd see a penny.  For the poor who don't have thousands a year to spend on that care, how did this system help them? \n\nSeems to me they were little better off than when this started.  This plan could not work forever and it looks a lot like it is starting to collapse.

Let's not prattle on about the health benefits of marijuana, which can be covered differently, (and why not a glass of red wine a day to boot?) Instead, we have decided to give preference to marijuana as a recreational drug with one of the lowest barriers to entry in a market. Marijuana legalization is a race to the bottom and we all know it. Rushing a deadline liek tis is pure arrogance.

Drugs have helped millions of people with depression and other mental disorders but benefits usually are partial in nature and involve unpleasant or intolerable side effects. ... This book presents an advanced nutrient therapy system that can help millions of persons with mental disorders.  This approach recognizes that most humans have nutrient imbalances due to genetic and environmental factors, and these imbalances can cause mischief in various ways: (1) serotonin, dopamine, and other key neurotransmitters (NT's) are continuously produced in the brain from nutrient raw materials that may be at improper concentrations; (2) nutrient imbalances can alter epigenetic processes that govern NT activity at synapses; (3) deficiency in antioxidant nutrients can cripple the brain's protection against toxic metals . . . \"",

One wonders, too, if Jesus -- at age 12 in the Temple, knowing He had to be about his \"Father's business\" (and the challenges, to say the least, that that Redemptive \"business\" and endurance would entail) -- would even consider marriage and having a young family, only to have to abandon them later on (his widow and young orphans) \"to do his Father's will\"  -- unless you have Jesus an overgrown child (in his twenties) playing at marriage, childless, a holy automaton without heart or complexity, indulging only on an oral level (food, drink and preaching)?

Repeated calls to employers, neighbors, friends, relatives.  The tone of voice, language used by collectors were over the top.  In 1977, in response to the demands of consumers, the Congress passed the law.  The issue I am addressing is the collector of the debt, not the debt itself.  I am saying that it does not matter if the debt is sold five times, if the collector is abusive, then the law has been violated.  What the Court is doing here is given shelter and comfort to businesses buying debt instruments, thus avoiding the intent of the law itself.  Get it?  Got it?  Good.",

Did God intrinsically (ontologicaly) alter Mary at her conception?\nThe way the author describes it, God seems to have \"set her up\" for her future role. I don't understand the reference that it was \"not so different\" from our Baptism.  So it was different? How? This is getting close to predestination to me and even closer to the dehumanization of Mary that distances her from being my mother. It is a sweeter and more palatable sterilization of Mary by associating only Mary's mom with the aches, pains and transformations of pregnancy.\nIf Mary was \"ontologically\" elevated at conception - woman priest?

It all starts with their doctrine of human sexuality and \"natural law\".   There is nothing wrong with bringing science and medical knowledge, including psychology into forming doctrines, especially since scripture of the New Testament is not specific on these matters.  In fact, most of scripture is specific only in the ways of love and how we treat each other.  The whole Bible, in my opinion, shows an evolution of the human race and their spirituality and relationship to God.  Why should it stop evolving as knowledge, faith and reason evolve?",

MAVNI allows people in the U.S. legally who aren't in an immigrant status--think those on student visas for example--to enlist if they have skills that are needed by the military and otherwise not available in the citizen and immigrant populations.

Very few of our potential Welfare to Work applicants could even meet the minimum qualifications for entry-level jobs, Range 8 or 10.   At that time, a single woman with two dependent children if she availed herself of all of the economic benefits for which she was eligible had an income roughly equivalent to a Range 14 or so, and she'd have more disposable income.   That's a job for which she would never qualify absent ten years of so of successful experience.   She would be crazy to go to work for us, few did, and fewer stayed long; they were and still are doing better staying home in their bathrobe - knew one, real well.",

The hours are very long for both, hot and dusty for one cold and wet for the other, wheat is automated, when I was on the slime line we had to scoop inside of each fish, many were frozen then coated with sugar then ?? reprocessed to cans, fillets not sure but more handling by workers.\nCost to the processer is much more than wages, add in transportation, food , housing it all adds up but that's the cost, cutting corners on food, housing using old broken down equipment is just not viable.

Today these same shares trade for $57.50 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Have a look.\n\nFact #3: While bond yields have risen significantly over the last 11 months, Enbridge common shares have risen in price by approximately 34%. Add in dividends and you'd be a bit north of 37% for total return.\n\nFact #4:  Since interest rates have bottomed and risen considerably, Enbridge common shares (symbol: ENB) have also risen considerably.  \n\nNo theories.

Yet, we now have Liberals, on the committee, saying the changes are too rushed and radical despite the fact that they took about 9 months to get the process underway. Neither the Greens nor the NDP support a referendum, so the fact that a referendum is being recommended from the committe suggests that the 5 Liberals on the committe wouldn't support what a clear majority had suggested.

(I was an adjunct faculty member in the Doctor of Ministry program at Andrews University and in the urban ministry MA program at Eastern University for more than a decade each. I have written several books and more than 120 research monographs over the last three decades.) I asked because I wanted to understand what specifically you were referring to and because I found your comment too general and ambiguous. Using your list of examples, I find very few Adventist preachers making much use of these or similar cliches, although I agree with you these are cliches. I think they are more widely used among non-clergy and the clergy who lack professional education (mainly in other denominations) than among the mainstream of Adventist pastors.",

Sure, compared to Tier 1, the Tier 4 worker has to put a lot more of their own money in, but we're legally assured the money will actually be there, whereas the Tier 1 system was never fully funded, so if the State goes bankrupt, Tier 1 retirees may find themselves with no pension.\n\nDefined benefit plans always had this risk, but people weren't aware of it.

If people can grow things like basil on rooftops instead of shipping it all across the country in plastic packaging, it’s worth the extra water to irrigate a rooftop garden.

It says in Matthew 1:24-25 That Joseph married Mary, but had no union with her until after she gave birth to her son.  Which indicates to me that they did have union, which is normal in marriage, after she had Jesus.  There are also references in the gospels to Jesus having brothers and sisters.  The book of James was probably written by Jesus's brother.  That is a commonly held opinion of scholars.  The disciple James had already died before this was written, and, according to the NIV study notes, \"The other two men named James had neither the stature nor the influence that the writer of this letter had.\"",

And, since the right resists a single payer option, it implemented a modest progressive tax to make healthcare affordable for over 20 million people who didn't have access to is previously. This isn't that different than any of the other programs I mentioned that set the infrastructure we have today. Without these regulations, people like me who were born with a pre-existing condition had absolutely ZERO options for affordable private health care (I never considered a career without a group health plan, and have been lucky to stay employed).

The drug cartels use immigrants trying to cross the border to be drug mules. Addicts are used to sell the drugs, they do it so they can get their drugs. Protection and increased security of our borders is needed. \nDrug treatment with new medications be implemented before addicts are released. Those who do not want treatment can sit in cells. \nCrimes committed for/because of drugs should be have higher penalties, no mitigation.",

To say nothing of the increased risk of injury or death attacking the biggest bull.  That's why they go after the small, weak ones.  And that's why herds of prey animals keep the small weak ones in the middle surrounded by the big strong ones.  Even the dinosaurs did that.

This new stadium was highly unpopular among all factions: students, locals, alumni, faculty, all except CSU football fans.  \nNotable too that Tony Frank has expanded the student base more than the academic departments and even \"reallocated\" 2% of the academic departments budgets away last year (reducing funding for the product, education, and that generates the real revenue).

The fact that doing what he did could have gotten him killed is exactly why APD's actions were noteworthy. They apparently chose to deal with the suspect under more controlled conditions with less risk to the officers, as well as the suspect, rather than escalate a non-threatening contact.

Sanders needs to shut up and just play.  \nLynch still has no confidence in his throws.  He has the jitters and cannot pull the trigger.

But you hate to see it because Boss was a great player during his time in Denver.  Now let's hope that money they save can be used on the OL.  Bolles and McGovern will be fixtures for the future.  Garcia could be if he improves his pass pro. Please Mr. Elway, cut Stephenson.  Find someone else.  You let that third round turnstile Schofield go.  Now show Donald the door. Please.  Sign Whitworth to a one year deal.  He would likely end up taking Menelik Watson's job.  Or bust a trade. Something to bring in a decent right tackle.  Watson is a backup only.",
