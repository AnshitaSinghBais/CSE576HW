I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

They will bark and run the fence to let you know they are standing their ground. If one were to get out and charge at you barking I would not blame you if you shot him. If you had a child with you, I would be remorseful that my dog caused you to fear for your child.

I'm not so sure from the tenor of your comments ;-}  Let me clarify the US from above...I mean the ones who want to kill us all, take jizya, or behead us, or make us convert; not all of them.  Shameful how the Dems didn't even recognize the wife of the Chief Owens!  Shameful.  Did you notice his wife?  SHE knew what the dealio was.  Why can't you?",

How about we provide a nice place for stock brokers and politicians to do coke? (we have them, they are called strip clubs). \n\nOne of my brothers was in the hospital for three months after a car accident during which time he became addicted to morphine. Once he left the hospital ya know what he did? He quit taking drugs! He toughed it out and got clean, despite the fact the doctors were all too willing to prescribe him a truckload of pills. \n\nHeroin users are useless junkies who have given up on life. Let them die.

The use of opioids to treat \"chronic pain\" is not the standard of care or recognized as appropriate therapy. I can't cite the specific numbers but there had been a more than massive increase in the prescribing of opioids in this country over the past 20 years. The problem is providers opened the floodgates and now the those downstream are drowning.",

All these faiths do teach us a basic respect for one another, of the God given humanity we all share.  But each faith wants to determine social rules that all must live by.  Maybe they just want villages of their own faith and separation of people by faith groups.  \n\nThat isn't going to work.

Only way out is that the firearm was mechanically flawed and there are nothing like that written. When I was trained, I was told that in gun handling, there is no such word as \"accident\". You are either carelessly negligent or the gun is mechanically malfunctioning. Most responsible gun owners/handlers understand that. DA and the justice system are very slow to understand that. \"Accident\" is a comforting word but its not a word that reflects reality. Gun is a dangerous device and to hold one is a great responsibility that should never be taken lightly. Mr. Walker-Webster, took it lightly and a human life perished for it.",

First though, there is a big distinction between intercity high-speed rail (HSR) and intrAcity grade-separated rail. Honolulu is not building HSR, they are building a grade-separated metro rail system. Think of it as a subway but elevated. The advantage of these systems over at-grade light rail are that 1) they travel faster between stations (up to 55mph) since there are no traffic lights, cars, bikes or peds to avoid, 2) they can have longer trains (at-grade trains are restricted by the minimum city block lengths), and 3) they can operate with shorter headways (more frequent).  These advantages add up to roughly double the average speed (30 vs 15mph) and around 4 times the maximum operating capacity (ppl/hr/direction).  HSR is a totally different beast. It goes over 200mph and stations are often hundreds of miles apart.",

It appears that everyone agrees that the Downtown Relief Line is a necessity, but no one wants to fund it despite the Province somehow finding the money to build a rail line between Pearson and Union Station. \n\nToronto Council's 'best' transit decision is a single stop extension of the Bloor-Danforth subway line to Scarborough Town Centre. An extension that does nothing for the majority of transit users in Scarborough because \"subways, subways, subways\".\n\nAs much as the Bloor Viaduct is sold as a triumph of planning, it's unlikely that the lack of a subway deck would have thwarted plans for a subway along Bloor/Danforth.

Portland seems to do a good job of low income siting and development. the odd duck out is all of the low income SROs in Chinatown.

Sadly, many people treat the PFD as an entitlement despite the court's decision that is firmly based on our state constitution. Because of this attitude, those same people consider a smaller appropriation for the PFD as a \"taking.\"  However, the PFD is an expenditure of state funds and that use of state funds must compete and be balanced against all other needs. A smaller PFD is not a taking, but should be the result of a careful and thoughtful process by the governor and the legislature to meet state needs from a smaller treasury.",

Death was something that had to be prevented by eating the magic tree of life. So he must have been 'subject' to it even before the 'fall'.",

Aquinas distinguishes four kinds of law: (1) eternal law; (2) natural law; (3) human law; and (4) divine law.   Eternal law is comprised of those laws that govern the nature of an eternal universe; as Susan Dimock (1999, 22) puts it, one can \"think of eternal law as comprising all those scientific (physical, chemical, biological, psychological, etc.) 'laws' by which the universe is ordered.\" Divine law is concerned with those standards that must be satisfied by a human being to achieve eternal salvation. One cannot discover divine law by natural reason alone; the precepts of divine law are disclosed only through divine revelation.\"\n\nThe natural law is comprised of those precepts of the eternal law that govern the behavior of beings possessing reason and free will. . . .\"\n\nhttp://www.iep.utm.edu/natlaw/",

And before we say \"it doesn't affect Medicare\" consider this. My supplemental Medicare policy provider has raised my monthly premium twice in the past year. For those who do not yet have Medicare, the supplemental policy covers the 20% of care that Medicare does not pay for. The supplemental policies are purchased from the private sector who can apparently charge what they want. As prices for care rise, the costs of these policies will rise along with them and they will soon reach an amount that many seniors cannot afford to pay. Remove Medicaid at the same time and many more seniors will be affected. So, when they say they are not touching Medicare, they may not be, but the recipients will still be punished unless legislation controls and reduces health care costs which this does not. Shame on them if they pass this.",

I shouldn't have to carry a gun to get an education-this isn't Afghanistan. My concern is the same for my son or any other student there; specifically that there will be an increased probability of \"Stand Your Ground\" killings on campus. One stupid misunderstanding or one extra dose of testosterone and someone pulls a gun. The Trayvon Martin shooting, though legally defensible even without stand your ground, is the perfect example of a needless death that I don't want to see at UAA-or anywhere else, and I certainly don't want it to happen to my son while attending an armed campus.",

When I questioned the AER if they were testing any H/C fracs, otherwise the process would not be relevant to the Didsbury report at all, I received no response. \n\nhttp://resource.aer.ca/whats-in-the-flare/\n\nPerhaps you need to be on the receiving end of AER actions to appreciate how little science is applied by the regulator.",

I believe we the people are the government, I do not want or need a political and media class telling me how to think or act. I believe through hard work we can all get ahead. I believe all voices have the right to speak, it does not matter if I agree with the points being made, I believe I have the right to listen, or not. I believe sometimes peoples feelings will get hurt, that is their problem, and theirs alone. I believe all lives mater, regardless of religious affiliations or not, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of whether they are born yet or not. I believe people should be held accountable for their actions, and not excuse politicians if they have a certain letter behind their name. I believe we are over regulated in our businesses, I also believe we are over taxed. I believe in legal immigration, I believe in the rule of law. I believe in helping the needed, I do not believe in helping freeloaders. \ncont.",

The predictable--the utterly foreseeable--result of withdrawing healthcare from many of the millions of people who obtained it by way of the ACA will be an increase in the number of both direct and spontaneous abortions, increased infant mortality, more deaths from complications of childbirth, and death and illness spawned by lack of medical care and inadequate nutrition. Pro-life? Absolutely not. \nHer pro-choice voting record and policies notwithstanding, Clinton---by way of her advocacy for expanded health care for women, children and infants--has done more to reduce the number and the rate of abortions in this country than Trump ever has or ever will.\nSupporting Trump on \"pro-life\" grounds was naive at best.  More often, it seemed to be a cynical and hypocritical rationale for voting for  a manifestly racist, fascist candidate.",

From January 2012 through April 2017, the annualized inflation rate has been 1.2%. Nor is there any reason for the US Fed to have a 2% target rate. The Canadian CPI has substantial upper-level substitution bias, which probably added at least 0.5 percentage points to the inflation rate in 1995, when the 2% target rate became effective at the Bank of Canada. The PCEPI due to its chain Fisher formula has virtually eliminated upper level substitution bias. The formal consistency with Canada in choosing a 2% target rate was logically inconsistent. Targeting the same true rate of inflation required a lower target rate, no more than 1.5%.",

Apparently Perez' position was based on erroneous articles written in the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, stating that Heath Mello had co-sponsored a law bill requiring women to look at an ultra sound before having an abortion.  That's quite a bit different from requiring doctors to inform women of their right to see an ultrasound.   https://www.thenation.com/article/why-was-heath-mello-thrown-under-the-bus/  I know that for many of you, The  Nation is not a good source of news, but it is a good source for insider info on Democratic Party goings-on.  This piece suggests that there is much more to all of this than just \"abortion politics\".\nThis piece is furthering that which it purports to decry -- polarization regarding the issue of abortion.",

For example, Nunavut (created to be a model of aboriginal self-government) receives per capita annual funding from the federal taxpayers of $42,055 (yes, that's right, a family of four in Nunavut receives annual support of $168,000 from federal taxpayers). That compares to the per-capita funding from the federal government for all Canadians of $1,986. Federal funding for Nunavut per capita is over 20 times greater than the average for all Canadians.

It was hard work getting a new job the first time but I got lucky the second time. I know ageism is a reality and I know others who were really stuck when laid off in their 50s. Something needs to be done about that too but I still believe that the biggest problem is at the bottom end of the age range where we need to get our younger people into the work force, the last thing we need is a generation on welfare and we need the energy and new ideas that the young bring to bear. In nay case, it makes not much sense to be encouraging people to work past 65 when it is the companies that are tossing them on the scrap heap some times years before that age.",

Doing so only reinforces the notion that you rigidly believe that \"since it never happened to me, it shouldn't happen to anyone.\"  Don't you see how absurd this sounds?\n\nPermit me to offer this:  I've never had a criminal record whatsoever, neither as a minor nor as an adult.

Well-being of the collective are emphasized over autonomy of the individual.  I often mark the beginnings of the loss of the Hawaiian nation at the breaking of the Kapu.  Many of those systems at the core of Hawaiian life were uprooted at that time, not by the will of the people, but at the behest of only a few.

There is a feeling that to argue for ordination as a social pragmatic issue ignores biblical evidence and imperatives.

It failed.\nYoung was once chair of the Coast Guard subcommittee which appropriates money for that branch of service, until he lost all leadership positions as censorship for other past ethical violations. Did he even try to seek funding for an icebreaker while he was in charge? No, and we now lack this crucial tool for arctic work because of his lack of action and foresight.\nPlease people.

The typical distance is 15,000 km between changes.  Modern engines simply do not fail with reasonable maintenance and most people spend money changing the oil excessively for no reason.  Changing the oil is for the next owner so wasting money on excessive oil changes makes no sense.  If you lease a vehicle for two or three years and then give them back, don't waste your money doing any maintenance at all.  If you decide that your existing vehicle has only a couple of years left in it, then again, stop doing maintenance.

The role of the Managing Director is to assure that all Departments' requests fit the Mayor's priorities.  Needless to say, money was diverted to ethics training.\n\nCorporation Counsel's anecdote as to a lack of follow through by Mr. Totto after she approved GPS funding is interesting.  Mr. Totto was required to seek union consultation regarding usage of GPS.  This is required whenever working conditions are impacted.  I will also add that unions are usually resistant to any technology that will increase effectiveness and efficiency of government workers because that may mean less union-paying workers.  (Cont.)",

Thus, most company-grade officers (lieutenants and captains in the Army), served their entire tours in field units.

A bride's veil is a relic of that.

A princess costume has a hat with a long draping veil. Search \"medieval veil\" to see the more extensive & opaque covering that remained part of a nun's habit until a few decades ago.\n\nBy contrast a \"bare-faced\" lie is a brazen lie, a naked lie, a lie without shame.

While to not support Hillary with my vote in November might feed my self-righteousness,  it would be counterproductive to my concern for the welfare of our country's future.  \n\nAll my life I've been a old-fashioned, FDR, working-class liberal....I continue to be.  IMO Hillary will, in every way imaginable, be a better choice for the welfare of today's and, importantly, tomorrow's America.  \n\nLet's remember how Nader, directly violating his word, refused to drop out of the 2000 race and endorse Gore.. IMO, he valued his \"purity\"  over the welfare of America.  How about you?",

I guess you don't see God in everyone and everything in God's Creation. Jesus didn't start a church, at thhe moment He died on the cross he opened the Holy of Holies so all of us can access God directly. He sent us the Spirit to guide all of us.

Also even the boys had good handwriting, you could look at the papers years later and see the teachers input. A math teacher found his students were not up to his standards so starting in the 7 th grade he took all the math skills from the 3rd grade up, made a full page test that had to be passed, if not a 2-3 page worksheet would be gone through then retested. This was prior to computers so it was all typed by the teacher. When those students got to high school they all just ripped thru Algebra I, finishing the entire text including the 'Advanced\" section at the back.

The recipient would respond and I'd receive his reply (it most often was his since females were confined to the secretarial pool) the next day. Most business was carried out by mail, not telephone. When that changed and the telephone became the favoured option, things began to speed up. I had less time to think about my reply ... and that one move began the remorseless increase in speed necessary to do business - through telex, then fax, then e-mail and so on until there was little time to think and business suffered.\nI can relate, Margaret.",

At the basis of Dignitatis Humanae is a teaching about conscience that is very much tied to what AL teaches about conscience. DH teaches that  religion is essentially something inward; AL teaches that morality is essentially something inward, that it is not essentially about the merely external keeping of rules. At the base of both is a conception of conscience which is Biblical and ecclesiastical, but at the same time inward and personalist.

I fear once the defined retirement benefits package is finally gone and everyone is using the 401k like plans, the employer will quit matching those (to increase profits).  Hopefully my concern is nothing.\n\nIn my opinion, 529s are bad investments. But if one hasn't taught themselves how to invest and save a small return on savings is better than no savings at all as you note. Additionally, 529s are a pain to disburse when the time comes. I was lucky and was able to experience 529s  thru my in-laws.\n\nI agree, a ROTH IRA (In an S&P 500 index fund and reinvesting capital gains and dividends) is the single best and safest long term investment one can make. There is a caveat though, if one switches jobs a lot, don't put money in any stock fund, to include the S&P 500.\n\nAgain, good on you for that match.  I wish you and your business well.",

Cardinal Wuerl, Bishop Flores, and other non-culture warrior bishops, like Pope Francis, adopt a different approach and with their words metaphorically extend their arms out in a more open gesture of welcome.

The only thing holding back full employment and a booming economy is Congress's heartless refusal to create jobs through investment in national infrastructure, which Eisenhower pursued to our everlasting benefit. It is people with the \"can't do\" mentality Bonevac professes, who hold us back.  Regulation is not the problem, refusal to serve the public, in the form of legislative anality, is.  Regulation is what keeps private industry from poisoning us, blowing us up, or starving us to make a buck.\n\n\"The Obama-Clinton policy requires us to push traditional allies away and seek relationships with avowed enemies.\"  Say what?

Later Lincoln  campaigned heavily for the Whig  presidential candidate Gen. Zachary Taylor with the hope he'd be appointed  head  of the Government Land Office.\nWhile Taylor won, he only proposed Lincoln as Oregon's Secretary of State, which he declined; Taylor then offered the  territorial governor's position but Lincoln declined that also.  Taylor then in 1850  appointed a fellow Whig, John Gaines, who proved to be rather unpopular in this largely Democratic state.\nWhy did Lincoln reject Taylor's offer  to be our second Territorial Governor?  Possibly because he'd have no political future in a largely D state, or  because Mary didn't want to \"Go  way out West.\"",

During the last 20 years when faced with fiscal challenges during 3 recessions, though temporary, Juneau screamed to tap the Permanent Fund instead of rolling back pet-peave programs and other unnecessary programs that would of come close to balancing the budget.

Right now, any gun violence statistics that are cited -- including homicides, suicides, accidental shootings, etc., are based on piecemeal data collection -- there is no central repository of gun violence data. The CDC, whatever you think of it, has the resources to fill that role.

Over and over, the courts said that Canadian governments were breaking our laws their treatment of him. In the end, after waiting two years, Harper's government finally brought Khadr back to Canada. Steven Harper must have known this would cost Canada plenty, yet, to do what was just would have cost the Conservative Party votes, which is the reason it was left to Prime Minister Trudeau to do the right thing, even though it will cost him votes as well.",

I would be happy to present the facts in debate with Gunnar Knapp, to prove that Alaska is being fleeced any time, any place. It is public knowledge that Gunnar's predecessor at ISER, Dr. Goldsmith, ignored the same questions and received a big check from oil interests to produce his report supporting the big giveaway of SB-21. The oil industry bought our legislature, and the  institutions created to educate Alaskans on issues important to the prudent management of state owned resources. Gunnar's writing clearly advocates taking our dividends and taxing residents before demanding a fair share of profits leaving our oil fields.",

Many years ago, a 1/4  per cent increase in interest rates was barely noticed. Even a 1 per cent increase over the span of several months didn't cause much alarm. But, these days household debt is huge compared to where it was when I bought my condominium in 1990 (a three year mortgage, at 12 per cent). My generation was much more wary of non-mortgage debt, so  most of us tried to avoid it as much as possible. Now, it seems that many younger adults have no idea how to manage a household budget and debt instruments,  or how to save money, hence the near panic over small interest rate increases. Can you imagine how younger adults would react to the high interest rates we became used to back in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s?",

I do blame developers, politicians, the law and greedy home owners. There so many people raising their rent just cause they can cause their neighbors are high so they think they can do the same. Developers are in the wrong too cause I hear when Wailea was built the developers was suppose to make affordable housing too for the workers there and they didn't do that. Politicians and the law let this happen. We need rent control here on Hawai'i. It's wrong how landlords can raise your rent hundreds of dollars in just one month. My aunty's rent raised $700 in one jump. My neighbor got asked to move cause the landlord is gonna fix it up and raise the rent from $1,200 to $2,000 which practically makes him homeless. He was in the process of fixing his car up to live in. It's so sad. There was a time we could make minimum wage and be able to live just fine.",

One has to assume the Canadian health care system was designed this way to appease private corporations, and particularly the insurance industry. A class-based analysis would surely conclude that it's mainly middle-class workers who benefit from the current system, but this is the same group of taxpayers that's been asked over the past three decades to furnish an increasing portion of government revenues while getting few direct benefits in return.

When he railed against oppression while wearing a Fidel Castro shirt he showed his own hypocrisy. When he admitted that he didn't vote, he showed his own selfish immaturity. When his girlfriend called the Ravens' owner a racist and Ray Lewis an Uncle Tom, it solidified the idea that the Kaepernick circus isn't worth his production. \n\nFrom a football(remember that) perspective, Kaep has talent but doesn't work well as a pocket passer. So, if a team picks him up, they have to accept his real limitations and balance that against his PR nightmare circus and it adds up to squat.

In that view, many people who simply can't stand Trump/Trumpism are now using religious language to voice their disgust and may cease to do so as time wears on. Whether this is a pro-refugee movement or an anti-Trump one will become clear in time.

Rather than potentially causing harm to insects, the wind generators kill millions of birds and bats (which eat the insects) annually.  Since a single dead bat can eat 1,000 insects per night, I guess we need to do something to reduce the numbers of insects!  As long as wind generators are not being required to limit their cut in speeds to reduce the number of bat kills, I can not get too concerned about dams killing some insects.  Unlike wind and solar, our dams also do more than just generate electricity.  They also provide flood control, WATER for irrigation and recreation which provides a huge economic benefit not just focused on developers and rich land owners, but broadly distributed and benefiting a huge number of citizens.",

The cost of that horrible mistake was $10.5 million in compensation.)\n\nAs for Omar Khadr, Canadian officials were complicit in his torture when he was but 16 years old. He endured almost 10 years confinement in Guantanamo, before serving an addition 5 years in Canadian maximum and medium security prisons. At every turn his rights were willfully ignored by the Canadian government. For that we're getting off lightly at $10.5M.\n\nOmar's guilt or innocence are of no consequence in this matter. He paid his debt to society for any transgressions he may have made. Now it's time for society to pay for ours.",
