His body was half outside the property line so that tells you it did NOT stop him. I have 2 huge black dogs inside a fence with 6 ft. gates. They will bark and run the fence to let you know they are standing their ground. If one were to get out and charge at you barking I would not blame you if you shot him. If you had a child with you, I would be remorseful that my dog caused you to fear for your child. To the people that get so bent out of shape over a dog being shot- what would you do if a MOOSE were charging you and your child with his head down, ears back- no doubt what his attempt was-to mow you down and stomp you. You would shoot him...would you not ?",

Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis. If courts jailed a few bishops, that might help a lot, too.",

Inform them that things like this can happen and it is always safe to tell you what is going on.  Let children know some of what a predator will say.  I will kill your family, no one will believe you, etc.  That is the BEST defense against the ever growing population of child predators.",

This makes these areas bad habitat for fish and prime habitat for salamanders, frogs and toads whose young have developed by then and moved to land.

From what I have read in recent years, it would seem that the story that he appeared on the streets of Denmark wearing the Star of David may be apocryphal.  Still, I think the story is apt. Many years ago, I heard this story recounted in a Christmas homily.  The homilist suggested that what King Christian had done in willingly taking on the Star of David, uniting himself to the Jewish citizens of his kingdom, was precisely an act inspired by the Incarnation of the Son of God, who willingly took on our humanity. It was a memorable homily -- I'm recounting it from the distance of more than thirty years; and no one suggested that King Christian's act of solidarity was anything less than radically, profoundly Christian.\nSo, too, any act of solidarity we Christian might devise or perform to resist a Muslim registry.\nI think that there will also be Jews who will likewise resist this evil.",

Let's hope they also vote in \"down ballot\" races.\n\nSince we have a goofy winner-take-all system, the voters in the swing states determine who wins. In those states, Trump supporters are thrilled when they hear Bernie supporters say they will never vote for anyone else.

There is a military honor guard ceremony in specific honor of Memorial day that concludes with Taps and an Air Force aircraft flyover in the missing man formation.  God Bless America and the National Anthem are performed.  In 1975 I marched with other Vietnam era vets in the 500 festival parade.  Does this speak to the significance between the 500 race and Memorial Day?  I don't know if you ever served in the military, but veterans remember and honor our fallen brothers and sisters.

The Russians went on planning despite the politics.  In 1868 with the AK Purchase The Russians were given a choice to stay or go back. Many of the Russians who did stayed later scrambled to leave as law and order ended. The territory was now in total chaos. Mobs and gangs ruled and many innocent people died at their hands. Law came to the territory finally when the representatives in the AK territory pled their case to the US Congress and Union troops from the territory of WA state were sent to restore law and order.

We need to address systemic issues that favor more aggressive medicine over less intensive interventions when the latter have been shown to be as effective, less costly, and safer (i.e., no side effects that compromise somatic health). There is no reason to assume that prescribing psychologists won’t succumb to the same market pressures that have led most psychiatrists to abandon therapy in lieu of becoming psychopharmacologists.

If you want to leave this matter in the hands of science, then it is best to allow ODFW to manage the wolf population.\n\nThis law will allow state wildlife biologists to deal with the situation, and prevent third party special interests from interfering by misusing the court system for their own political agenda.\n\nNot signing this new law would have turned the management of wolves in Oregon into a political game.",

The governor here declared in his state of state address, that they were going to give teachers a huge raise. He said look for our budget announcement the same week. The announcement was made as promised. The raise? It was 4/10ths of one percent. Teachers were insulted. After negative feedback they are considering a $5000 raise. Even with that raise, teachers in Arizona will still be around 49th in pay nationwide. And they will only give the raise if voters approve an additional sales tax. We have thousands of vacant positions here that will never be filled. Class sizes are 40 or more. Some districts can't give any raises, so they offer a 4 day school week as an enticement. \nWhy Alaska's politicians and educrats at the school district offices don't get it is surprising. Learn from other states mistakes. Before it's too late.",

I'm not 100% sure, but I think the current system dates to the mid 1970s. There were two key factors. One was unification: before that, the city, borough and airport all had separate permitting schemes and different regulatory standards. If not for the fact that APD provided police services to the borough's Spenard police service area, things would have been a lot more convoluted. The second key factor dating to the mid 1970s is the fact that persons with stroke in the community started investing in the taxi business when the pipeline construction caused the business to suddenly become a rather lucrative venture. Near as I can tell, taxi permits were open-entry at one point a long time ago. That doesn't help someone who entered the game looking for an investment but weren't necessarily looking to be more actively involved.",

The fender benders caused by the disappearing left lanes on 6th and serpentine lanes on 7th add to the external costs of this EMX boondoggle.

He would just be another face in the crowd otherwise. And the new officers are learning that it's not only acceptable behavior at HPD but it is ENCOURAGED ovr the course of 17 years. That's coming by way of police culture from the media and the mainland, and that's a larger problem that a black police chief might address.  And he's not the only black guy here targeted by skin color, he's just the one that made the news.  Why the rest of the media isn't all over it is because navigating pulling up the police, court, and medical records to substantiate everything is probably too difficult.

Frequently, they don't see themselves as poor even when they actually are. Rather they view themselves as temporarily \"down on their luck\" and look up to the rich (Trump-like figures) as role models even though in reality they have almost no chance of emulating them, their lifestyles or wealth especially in the absence of an education. The white lower middle class men (especially) seem to view educated women (like Hillary Clinton or professional women) with disdain. \nClass isn't as cogent in America not because of elitism in academia (which of course exists) but rather because Americans eschew class comparisons and the very idea of equality.",

Just a month ago they announced they'd launch three missiles to land within 30 NM of Guam, the US Pacific island. So I have no sympathy for North Korea over its verbal threats. I'm no fan of US military hegemony, either. But between North Korea and the USA, I'm most comfortable with the latter.\n\nIf NK wishes to build up its military capability, it's free to do so. But because it's a member of the UN, North Korea may not build nuclear weapons and it may not build ballistic missiles. And if it continues to issue military threats against other nations, they are entirely within their rights to respond.",

The humility and wisdom of recognising that they don't have all the answers and so they seek help, apparently from the right European technical experts.\n2.

What I will say is this:  you are certainly entitled to your opinion, but support, among US citizens, decreases every year.  It's now at about 50/50. And, God willing, we won't have it much longer.  Even Pope Francis calls it very wrong:  \"The death penalty is inadmissible to matter how serious the crime committed.  It is an offence against the inviolability of life and the dignity of the human person, which contradicts God's plan for man and society, and His merciful justice, and impedes the penalty from fulfilling any just objective. It [the death penalty] does not render justice to the victims, but rather fosters vengeance.\"  I'll hang with Pope Francis and The RCC on this.",

I haven’t studied the issue.

Between 1976 and 1991, the NHL staged five best-against-best tournaments, known as the Canada Cup. The hockey was superb, and Canadians were obsessed. But fans in the rest of the world – notably the giant U.S. market – could not have cared less.\n\nThis is because sports was minimally marketed comparatively AND the fervor was far more specifically patriotic.  No one in North America cared about the World Cup until 1994 either and now look at it.",

In Ontario, only a percentage of tenants - those living in buildings built before a specified year in the 1990s (I believe 1991) - are protected under Ontario's \"guideline\" rent increase system, and even then they're only protected to a certain extent as AGIs can be applied to these tenants. As for turnover units, landlords can charge new tenants in any building whatever the market will bear as there is no protection against large increases in base entry rents charged to new tenants. There is no longer a \"rent control\" system in Ontario. Once a new tenant has lived in their apartments for a year their right to protection under the guideline system kicks into effect, provided they live in a building that qualifies. I believe that tenants who rent in newer condo buildings (a quickly expanding segment of the rental market) and rentals built after 1991 aren't protected at all under the current regime.",

Allow peanuts in schools and make sure the child carries an Epipen and that child and school staff know how to use it (it's really simple).

Vietnam with a fleet of Chevy pickup trucks in the 1950's. We lost 58,000 Americans for no good reason. Oliver North learned how to be a drug dealer there, working with the CIA. That knowledge came in handy during the Iran Contra debacle. Vietnam was one of several unnecessary wars we fought after the Korean war. We were lied into the Vietnam war, not unlike how we were lied to about Iraq. We eliminated the draft to make going to war easier. Now we don't have to worry about mass war protests when all the troops chose to be ready to kill on command without question. It is also why we hire mercenaries like Blackwater. We need their bodies to make up for the lack of a draft. There is nothing moral about any of this. All lives don't matter to most Americans, and virtually all Trump voters in particular.",

I am sorry that it falls on this generation of the Ummah, but we are not always able to choose the challenges we face, individually or collectively.  Time to work on it Ms Aziz.  \n\nStop the takfiri terrorism and the violent response will evaporate like a puddle in the desert.",

WWII, where everybody came together in a common cause, was the equalizer, and after that, according to my father, the increasingly secular society that emerged was more harmonious, cohesive and equitable and offered greater freedom and dignity for everybody.

They have a tendency to bolt or wander for hours without any sense of danger or awareness just as an elderly person with dementia might do. As the author stated, young kids with ASD are utterly fascinated by water and will jump in without a thought.  Explaining the danger does not work since most have no real concept of what danger is.

This is the series from which the replacement cost CPI gets its dwelling price data. Consequently inflation is badly underestimated for BC homeowners.

If this were true I am sure we could find a list of \"evils\" committed by the ancestors of the blacks  that are being told how bad the Jesuits were/are. \n\n Yes a number of Jesuits betrayed the name of Jesus, a long time ago, but WE have not.  We can not ask for forgiveness for what the dead have done, and the decedents can not give forgiveness. This is funny theology with funny consequences, and has nothing to do with  Catholic morality.  \n\nOne consequence is that it undermines the idea that the individual is saved from sin. If I am responsible for all the sins of my (human) race,  one wonders if I can ever be forgiven. Christ frees us from the sins of the past and urges us to go forth in a life of grace. This is spiritual scruples on steroids. Mea culpa that never ends.",

What does this mean? \n\nIf I were working in Canada right now, I would have to earn 124 thousand CAD before I have to worry about paying US taxes. This is in addition to my US personal exemption and all the other tax accounting tricks I have to deal with. With my wife in the mix, that becomes 248k CAD, and that number goes up every year indexed to inflation. That's income that the US will not count as income at all for me. If I get lucky enough to earn, say, 258kCAD (210kUSD at current exchange rates), then I'll subtract the 202k USD exemption from the 210k USD income and then pay an awesomely amazing...$800 in US taxes, assuming Canada's tax reciprocity agreement with the US doesn't eat those away. Make no mistake. Living in Canada means I'll pay less US taxes than if I stayed here. But I still get to vote! That was my point. :3",

There were no death camps in Vatican City (though thousands of priests were interned in them elsewhere), no executions of civilians at the Vatican as in France and Germany, and no high-powered banks involved in the plunder of European Jews as among the Swiss.
