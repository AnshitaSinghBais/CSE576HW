While major insurance companies are dropping out, those who have insurance through an employer based offering are also not utilizing their benefits.  Why? Because like everyone else who is insured the deductibles and co-insurances are so high they cannot afford to use them.  So we have given america health insurance they cannot use but force them to pay for-which means people are not seeing MD's and when they do they cannot afford their portion which leaves the MD's high and dry.

The 55 mph sections should be reduced to 45 mph (and 65 to 55) when traffic is heavy and also when road conditions are more hazardous (icy, heavy rain, etc). Also the Seward Highway south of Portage has quite a number of extra passing lanes that work very well - its tight along the cliffs between Anchorage and Girdwood but there are places they could squeeze a few more in. Also seems there is room for a few more passing lanes between Girdwood and Portage.

The AER continually rebukes and ignores all relevant science, particularly when it comes to the impacts of harmed citizens. \n\nI will cite for you several examples. \n\nThe first, changes to Directive 60: Flaring, Incineration and Venting, in which the regulation was changed to permit off lease odours, based on the \"opinion of an inspector\" and the duration, frequency, strength and proximity of the odours. The AER can not even use the proper, scientific  term for F,V, I wastes, which are industrial emissions, instead using the innocuous term odour, throughout all AER directives.",

In addition, the spread of Islam thru violent conquest since the time of Mohammed himself, while often similar to the spread of other religions in the past, is still advocated today by a vocal, murderous, & rather large group of folks in the name of Islam. In a free society, we must be able to discuss how to address such an influential and dangerous ideology (if held by a minority of Muslims or not) without the discussion being shouted down by accusations of Nazism and imminent holocaust.

Home Capital operates and complied with OSFI regulations, there is no suggestion that they violated those regulations which are some of the most conservative in the world.\n\nThird, it has yet to be determined whether their non prime mortgage book (which is performing with below-average delinquency) will be going anywhere but if it does, it has value. High ratio mortgages are still covered by CMHC and even if the real estate market declines substantially, mortgagors take the loss long before the underwriters.",

After that, the deficits went down with the 2007 deficit being only 161 Billion. Then the democrats took control of the house in Jan. 2007. After that, the deficits climbed rapidly and the business community took the country on a ride due to very heavy investments in junk mortgages. In other words, the 2003 tax cuts worked and reduced deficits, increased receipts to the government, lowered unemployment, increased average wages and kept inflation low. All while fighting a war. That changed after Jan. 2007.",

Zuma's solution is to ensure, via secret ballot, that supporting him is now risk free.  The unashamedly hard line taken by the ANC on voting compliance was part of the set-up to ensure that a secret ballot was used.  There can be little doubt that the secret ballot also signifies that Zuma et al do not see it as a threat.  In my view, it's all been a piece of Kabuki theater.

Eisenhower didn't sent any troops to fight in Vietman, he sent a team of advisors, not combat troops.\n\nObviously every war has a history behind in, and escalating tensions that led to war.  That's obvious.  We could spend days dissecting the history leading up to each war.  But that's not the point here.  We were simply talking about who was US president when we started engaging in combat.\n\nOf the major wars, that's 4 by D's I listed above, and 3 by R's since (Desert Storm, Afganistan, Iraq).

And interestingly, Quebec is not required to include its Hydro revenues in the transfer payment formula, meaning it will still have the benefit of transfer payments from other regions, in addition to its extra Hydro revenue.\n\nSo, does Trudeau actually need Notley anymore, or is he now at the point where he can just ignore Alberta, and let the province's economy wither in the dust?",

I also have to say that an average MD billing 240K (this is what the average family doc bills grossly) is equivalent to a civil servant making 110-120K salaried with full benefits a year.

Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

One cannot legitimately tell people that they CANNOT receive Communion on the tongue, or tell people that they MUST STAND when Jesus becomes truly present during the Eucharistic Prayer, or that we'll all consume the Eucharist SITTING DOWN at the same time as the priest as if we were at a banquet, or that the priest can distribute the BODY of Christ before he himself consumes both the Body and Blood of Christ, etc. \nMr. Winters, if you knew that more than 1 million people, including many priests and bishops, are celebrating with these very abuses in the Mass, would you still be so critical of Cardinal Sarah?",

Judge Judy is the highest paid person in all of television, anywhere in the world. Why? She brings in the most money. I don't see Judge Joe Brown complaining; his show has fewer viewers. \n\nOr is the argument that all men and women should make the same amount, regardless of talent, qualification, working hours, experience, viewership etc., 'because feminism'?

And left field was practically vacant going into the season. You couldn't seriously believe that the starting rotation would repeat their success from 2016.

Unitarians are cool in my book, we did a Christmas 'presentation' from our Sunday school class into the main church congregation area.

I wheeled in this big ol' 6' red Trex with green claws.  \"Ruuuuun nativity scene, RUUUUUUUN!!\"  Took forever to color, myself and 2 grown men hours to build.  This was before Calvin and Hobbes.

That coincidence has led to an entitlement psychology wherein white males think that success is their entitlement and anyone outside their sphere (read that people of color, women, LGBTs etc.) are by default inferior. They can not fathom that such people can not only compete successfully with them they can surpass the achievements of otherwise 'entitled' whites. This was the reason why women and POC could not vote, and were discriminated against. Allowing these people to exercise equal rights they thought would diminish their own rights and prove there isn't anything particularly special about a white male. Obama was one of the nightmares - a successful African-American, H. Clinton will be another nightmare proving again that white males are not a special  people. Remember, at first it was WASP white males discriminating against Catholics in the same way they now discriminate against anyone not white and male.",

The same shallow thinking is evident here.  I don’t regard +Chaput as a serious thinker, at least with respect to these issues.  I suspect that in the age of Pope Francis, a small but growing number of bishops will not follow where +Chaput wants to lead them.

With a redacted video, you will not be able to see the alleged thief loosening anything to prep for the theft.  I’ve seen the video of the mailbox theft many times on television.  Have also seen Mr. Puana, both on TV and in the newspaper.  Not being an expert, or have the privilege of seeing the video close up; the body type of the person in the video and Mr. Puana are quite different to me.  Guy in video has a more athletic build, Mr. Puana is more heavy set, rectangular.  The FBI agent, who did have access to repeated close up of the video stated “man in the video does not appear to be Puana”.  Yet Kealohas & Nguyen positively identify Puana.",

I also want to know what am I going to do with my old worn out panels and how much will that cost to get rid of!  Will I be able to get rid of them?  Will it be government or will I have to hire a private contractor?  Cost!  This may not be a big issue now but you can be sure it will be as government FORCES us into renewables.

Canadian government, i.e. taxpayers are ultimately on the hook if projects fail.  And since these are the least practical of all infrastructure projects, they likely will fail while user fees on this infrastructure will increase.  Then there was his boasting that he convinced Warren Buffet to loan money to, i.e. bail out, Home Capital.  And now this boondoggle.

In the military chaplains are paid according to their rank. The married priests I served with did a good job providing ministry and presence, and had a pastoral sense that we celibate males will never help. Not everybody is called to rectory living. There is plenty of room for dialogue and study on this. Stating a priori that married priest won't work out is not a good place to begin. The Holy Spirit is full of surprises. Celibacy is not an essential part of serving as a priest, whether male or female. Ministry of priesthood is not about \"power\" to change the bread and wine. It is about serving, leading, gathering folks together in prayer. Power has nothing to do with it. Its not magic.",

JuJu Bean made the argument that the issue was Trump making more than he was taxed. I pointed out that he had a loss and received favorable tax treatment due to the business loss and I pointed out that at the time, it was the democrats that had written the tax laws. You made the comment that I was becoming more dishonest every day because I was saying the republicans had nothing to do with the tax codes. I then used facts to show your assertion to be false since democrats were in control of the house for the 40 years prior to 1995 and had control of the house ways and means committee, where all tax law is written. I said tax votes were straight party line? Where? Facts still tripping you up muck.",

Before the gun was drawn, here're the problems:  1) The Pitbull was brought to the airport;  2) The Pitbull was let out of the car; 3) The Pitbull was outfitted with a leash that was too weak to hold it; 4) The Pitbull was tethered to a public tree unattended; 5) The owner didn't control the Pitbull; 6) The owners of the present and apparently protective (big, known to be dangerous) Pitbull apparently got into a confrontation with a security officer giving orders.   6 things that were wrong before the gun got involved.

It's privatization of the park, turning into a event venue with concessions and prohibiting or limiting public access, that I most object to. That and being able to make their own rules without any oversight from the public, or even our elected political authorities.  Oh, that and making the Master Plan without any public demand or purpose. Oh, that and forging ahead in spite of public opposition (or funding from City Council).",

The judge bases that decision on two factors: flight risk and/or danger to the community.  In Mr. Christie's case, the judge found that both factors were present.  That decision was appealed twice and both times, the decision was upheld by other judges.  Mr. Christie filed at least two additional motions to reconsider his detention and his motions were denied by other judges and those denials were affirmed by the 9th Circuit.  In each instance, none of the detention decisions were made by Ms. Nakakuni.  Furthermore, Mr. Christie was represented by an excellent defense counsel, Thomas Otake.  As such, there was no \"abuse of power\" by the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Federal judicial system worked quite well.",

'Baby Boomers' as a group ranged within the parameters of birth years 1946 to 1965 -- a 19 year spread.\n\nTherefore, to say that 1967 was about shucking off British colonialism with the Liberal 'Red & White' flag offering is a silly exaggeration.. The anti-American sentiments were always a Cdn effort to maintain sovereign independence.\n\n1967 was 'all about Vietnam' for those born prior to 1950... including old Lester B. Pearson & his Liberal Gang + John Diefenbaker & his Progressive Conservative Gang.\n\nTrudy & Chretien were waiting in the wings for their kick at the Can.\n\nOh, yeah..\n\n*Lester Pearson kept Canada out of Vietnam, Not Mr. Fuddle Duddle*",

When climatic factors as well as soil conditions are taken into account, it is more accurate to say that half of Canada’s best farmland is within that radius.  Couple these facts with the knowledge that from 1966 to 1971, Ontario lost 26 acres (10.5 hectares) of improved farmland every hour and one can appreciate the enormity of the loss.” (Sparrow, p. 59-60). \n\nSince 1971, much more prime foodland has been lost to development in the Golden Horseshoe, also in the St. Lawrence Lowlands.

Gaddafi had a bunch of gold and oil and our French colonial buddies wanted to preserve their currency in Francophone Africa.  Wikileaks revealed the \"humanitarian intervention\" narrative to be a lie.  \n\nSeriously, who here would support putting Hillary in prison?  And I'm not talking about Donald Trump supporters, I'm talking about so-called \"progressives\" who ostensibly seek \"justice.\"  Where is the justice for Libya?  \n\nBut the problem is we'd have a never-ending political kangaroo trial every 4 years.",

Enthusiasm for increasing the role of natural gas in our energy mix is largely premised the assumption that it will come mostly from 'our' domestic resources.\nWhile avoiding bankruptcy of PetroSA by attracting an equity partner may make sense to its board, there's no indication of how the deal might on balance benefit the nation, even if large quantities of relatively easily-extracted gas are actually found.\nSeems \"path dependency\" on concentrated energy is taken as license both for selling off national resources (with associated elite enrichment) and further lock-in to fossil fuels.",

I don't mind a bit if the repeal is partisan also, as it returns us to the starting point.  Lisa promised to vote for a straight repeal in 2015.  She even voted for one then.  She ought to do what she said she promised to do 2 years.  Otherwise, she opens the door for Miller or someone like him in a couple years.\n\nO'BamaCare more than doubled insurance premiums in AK.

Why can't and shouldn't that person - affluent by any definition -  accept a $50 000 pension, have the pooled money used for other, more equitable purposes and if they want more they can save privately like most others are asked to do.

Done.\n\nI do think it's perverse that some people are getting paid by the IRS though, that's one step too far in my book.",

She also has been clear that her photo op  at an anti-aircraft gun was wrong. She has been clear on that and apologized. And often. She followed up with much work to help veterans whether drafted or volunteer.  I dont think she feels she is an authority on everything.

She is entitled to her opinion, and to use her energy and wealth to support causes she believes in.

Denial also could mean denying the happening of an event or the reliability of information, which can lead to a feeling of aloofness and to the ignoring of possibly beneficial information.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial",

As I now understand the law, this could be considered a felony, armed assault, because until they acted, they did not overtly threaten me.    After that, I did obtain a concealed carry permit, which was difficult to get in Boston, and I carried  .25 Barretta in my front pocket.  I was never mugged again, but that probably had to do with the fact that I stayed out of parks, even in the daytime.

JPII and Cardinal Ratzinger, as well as some Latin American conservative bishops, soon began to see them as detrimental to the purity of the Catholic faith in Latin America.

In doing so he often goes overboard and finds himself swimming in murky water.\n\nBut he is indeed a standard issue Republican, despite his anti-establishment rhetoric - let's look at his chosen economic advisers, mostly billionaire bankers and developers, trickle-down taxers, and not a single academic economist or populist in sight.

Trudeau's insistence on three-way trade talks brings Canada needlessly into Trump's crosshairs, whereas we could have cut a better deal through bilateral talks. \n\nThis is made all the more perplexing by the fact that Canada itself has been substantially harmed by Mexico's inclusion in the North American free trade zone. We get cheaper avocados, sure, but at the cost of eviscerating major Canadian manufacturing areas, such as Windsor. \n\nAt its root, I think Canada's position here is guided by a totally naive and childish view of the nature of the Mexican government, which in reality is highly corrupt, authoritarian and conniving.",

Furthermore, that you are essentially concerned that she should grow up to be a healthy adult in both mind and body.\n\nBut, if you ascribe to the belief that your daughters life is at greater risk simply because she is a Muslim, and such a belief is detached from recognition that the actions of fundamentalist Islamists worldwide have an impact on this dynamic, then in my opinion your view is unbalanced and only a part of the story.\n\nIn truth of course one cannot separate these two aspects. When violence is repeatedly enacted in the name of Islam, you cannot expect that it will not impact the view the world takes of you when you identify as a Muslim. \n\nI would respectfully ask, what are you, as an educated Muslim woman, and a journalist to boot, doing to strengthen those moderate Muslims who would seek to reform Islam? Personally I see no resolution in the long run other than this.",

There are no exceptional circumstances recognized under law which would allow an abortion - no abortion in case of rape or incest, to protect the life/health of the mother, no abortion if there are fetal defects.  This is the Catholic bishops dream - women as cows.  This is the kind of law that only works when the world is perfect, when there is no rape, when a pregnancy never threatens the life or health of a woman.    \n\nWe have to remain vigilent here so we do not turn back the clock the way El Salvador did in the late 1990's and is threatening to happen in Poland.\n\nSatisfied?",

All major civilizations had \"tributes\" back then and like today, such things were resented by those who have to pay the \"tribute\". Back then, you may not pay your tributes only in \"money\" but also in goods. (Barter system.) They were pretty flexible back then. During the Roman Empire, tributes were used to built fancy palaces, forums and such....but also to built road network, pay the legions on land and on sea, laying the foundation of the Empire (both Republic/Imperial).  Roman taxation also created a welfare state for Rome's masses. \"Bread and circus\" is the term we called it!! So yes, taxation do create civilizations.

To the experts on St. Paul, the writing is too different and I agree that it kind of turns on itself.  We have Paul who makes fun of the Galatians for being too concerned with the legality of everything they do, but who then writes 2 letters which only concentrate on making church structure in a very legalistic fashion.  Often people wrote letters & signed famous people's names to them hoping they would be more accepted and experts agree this was likely here.",

They think the doctor on the reserve can fix cirrhosis of the liver caused by years of alcohol abuse. They think there is a ready medicine for heart disease caused by smoking.

They tell themselves that if the doctor can't fix their health problems, its because the doctor is withholding treatment. After all, \"They cure white people don't they\".

Killing his parent, ok, lots of reasons, he could have been abused, or acting in self-defense. We don't know at this point. But a shooting rampage at an elementary school? Never any kind of reason, it was cold blooded attempted murder. To make it worse, now these victims will have to go through a trial and relive this experience over and over for the next few years.
