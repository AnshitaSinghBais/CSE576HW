The Eagles held the Patriots to 0 points in the first quarter, but Brady threw a touchdown to James White on the first play of the 2nd quarter, followed by an 11-yard strike to Danny Amendola to make the game 14-0. New England tried an onside kick to surprise Philadelphia, but the special teams were ready and recovered it, giving the Eagles ideal field position. Bradford took advantage of this with a 5-yard touchdown to Zach Ertz next drive, but could not get going following the drive. With 15 seconds left, New England looked poised to end the half with a 7-point lead, but Chris Maragos blocked a punt that middle linebacker Najee Goode took back 24 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Brady drove the ball to the five yard line, but free safety Malcolm Jenkins had other plans, catching an interception and running it back for a 100-yard pick six. Next drive, New England was forced to punt, which Darren Sproles took back 83 yards for a touchdown. Next drive, Brady threw an end zone pick to cornerback Byron Maxwell, who went down in the end zone for a touchback. In a drive set up by Maxwell's INT that lasted well into the fourth quarter, Bradford threw a TD to Jordan Matthews, and the Eagles were leading 35-14. Enraged fans started to leave the stadium, but soon the lead would thicken as the Patriots scored, recovered an onside kick, and scored again, turning things to make the score 35-28 with 3 minutes left. Riley Cooper batted the next onside kick out of bounds to secure the Eagles possession. After 3rd string running back Kenjon Barner fumbled with slightly over a minute left, Tom Brady and the undermanned Patriots' offense attempted to rally to tie the game, but dropped passes by Martin and Amendola ultimately lead to the underdog Eagles stunning New England and its home crowd. Although Bradford posted very few yards, he threw 2 touchdowns and continued to not turn the ball over. Outside linebackers Connor Barwin and Brandon Graham scored 2 sacks each. DeMarco Murray returned to his shape from weeks 1-4, rushing for 24 yards on 8 carries, which turns into a pitiful 7 carries for 5 yards when you take away his longest run of 19 yards. Darren Sproles stepped up, rushing for 66 yards, receiving for 34 yards, and returning punts for 115 yards and 1 touchdown. With the win, the Eagles go to 5-7, ending a three-game skid and passing the Giants for second place in the NFC East. With a loss by the Washington Redskins, the Eagles' 5-7 record tied them with the Redskins for the best record in the NFC East, but their Week 4 loss kept them in second. Not only was this their first win against the Patriots in the Brady-Belichick era (preseason notwithstanding), but two years later, they would proceed to claim their first Super Bowl title in their next game against them.\nQuestion: Which players threw two touchdown passes?",

The Finnish parliament had to create ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union.

The French monarchy also resorted to heavy borrowings during the war from financiers at rates of 10-16 percent interest. The taille was estimated in collection for 1551 at around six million livres. During the 1550s, Spain had an estimated military manpower of around 150,000 soldiers, whereas France had an estimated manpower of 50,000.\nQuestion: How many more millions of ducats did Charles V borrow over what the Metz campaign cost?",

When comparing the two teams, Brad Gagnon of CBSSports.com stated they are \"complete opposites\", with Marc Trestman being a pass-first coach, while Rex Ryan prefers running first; as a result, while the Bears were ranked higher in passer rating (9th to 25th) and QB rating against (4th to 26th), the Jets had the advantage in yards per carry (5th to 23rd) and yards per carry against (3rd to 28th). In the running game, Gagnon writes the Bears' 23rd-ranked rushing offense would have trouble against the third-ranked Jets run defense, which had allowed only 2.8 yards per carry. He adds that as a result, the Bears would be forced to throw - 71 percent of Chicago's offensive plays had been passing, the most in the league, which Gagnon states is not a \"good thing\", as the five teams with the highest passing percentage in the NFL in 2013 had losing records. Additionally, the passing attack would have to defend against the rush, with the Jets blitzing 75 percent of the time; New York had recorded 47 sacks since week one of 2013, tied for the 10th most in the league, while Pro Football Focus ranked Muhammad Wilkerson and Sheldon Richardson as the top 12 pass-rushing 3-4 defensive ends in the NFL, with Quinton Coples having the most QB pressures of a 3-4 OLB with ten. However, Jay Cutler had completed 67 percent of passes under pressure, the second-most in the NFL. the Bears led the league in completions of four yards or more on first down with 21, and despite injuries to Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery, the passing game could have a chance against a secondary that struggled in the previous week against the Packers.

Chris Ivory also had the highest rushing average with 6.3 yards, while the Jets averaged 5 yards offensively, and the Bears were allowing 5.3 yards per carry, while allowing a total of 320 yards and four touchdowns on 60 carries.

The Bears' captains were Cutler, Lance Briggs, and Danny McCray, while Sherrick McManis, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Matt Slauson, Charles Leno, Jr., and Trevor Scott were not active. The Bears won the coin toss, and deferred until the second half. On the second play of the Jets' first drive, Smith's fake screen pass was intercepted by Ryan Mundy, scoring on a 45-yard return. After the Jets punted, the Bears also were forced to punt, but Jalen Saunders muffed the punt, which was recovered by Ahmad Dixon. Four plays later, Jay Cutler threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, with New York scoring the final points of the first quarter via Nick Folk's 43-yard field goal.

On the Bears' following possession, Cutler was stripped by David Harris, with Demario Davis scoring on the return. However, the officials had believed Cutler was downed prior to losing the ball, and while a challenge ruled the play as a fumble, the touchdown was not recorded. Despite the takeaway, the Jets would be forced to punt. The half would end with no additional scoring. On Chicago's first drive of the second half, Cutler threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Bennett.

Waterhouse spotted several small vessels in the port of La Guaira and decided to attack, implementing a rudimentary plan.

Shaykh Khazal and Bakhtiari Khan's met between April 29 and May 2, 1922, in Dar-i Khazinah to establish a cooperation; another meeting between the parties in Ahvaz produced a formal document that Khazal and Bakhtiaris would cooperate in every respect, although both would \"continue to serve Iranian government faithfully and loyally\". The agreement was an important step which paved the way to the establishment of the Southern League. The nucleus of the alliance, based on Shaykh Khazal and the Bakhtiaris, later tried to attract additional elements, including the Vali of Pusht-i Kuh, Qavam al-Mulk of Khamsah and possibly Sawlat al-Dawlah. The League however had no formal existence, being largely a temporary tribal confederation with common interests.\nQuestion: How many days did Shaykh Khazal and Bakhtiari's Khans meet?",

The volumes of travellers and the wet weather made the trail impassable and, by late 1897, it was closed until further notice, leaving around 5,000 stranded in Skagway. An alternative toll road suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors began to make their way into Canada.

Most divided their belongings into 65 pounds  packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by hand on a sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least 2,500 miles , before they had moved all of their supplies to the end of the trail.

With an estimated population of 11 million in 1400, 20 million in the 17th century, and 28 million in 1789, until 1795 France was the most populated country in Europe  and the third most populous country in the world, behind only China and India. These demographic changes also led to a massive increase in urban populations, although on the whole France remained a profoundly rural country.  Paris was one of the most populated cities in Europe .  Other major French cities include Lyon, Rouen, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Marseille. These centuries saw several periods of epidemics and crop failures due to wars and climatic change.  Between 1693 and 1694, France lost 6% of its population.

Tampa Bay's defense dominated the third quarter, forcing Jacksonville a turnover on downs, a fumble in the end zone (recovered by Gray on 1-yard line), and a blocked punt. The good field position led to Michael Bennett's first touchdown as a Buccaneer. The fourth quarter saw Jacksonville re-take the lead with an 8-yard touchdown pass.

During the winter 1340-1341, the Golden Horde  attacked Poland and reached Lublin as a result of diminished tribute from the principality to the Mongol khan. The raid weakened Polish influence in the principality. Eufemija, Boleslaw's widow, was drowned in the Vistula in winter 1342 to keep her out of the succession disputes. Detko, who managed to play Poles, Lithuanians, and Mongols against each other, disappeared from written sources in 1344.

Acquisition of an undivided Empire by the Habsburgs or Bourbons would change the balance of power and the conflict ultimately involved much of Europe. In making dynastic claims secondary, the war marks a key point in the development of the nation state. It was also the last of Louis XIV's wars to establish defensible borders and French supremacy in Europe, the most recent being the 1688-1697 Nine Years' War when France was unable to defeat the Grand Alliance. The 1697 Treaty of Ryswick was driven by mutual exhaustion and the recognition by Louis that he needed allies for a war over the Succession. Emperor Leopold initially refused to sign the Treaty since it left this issue unresolved; he reluctantly did so in October 1697 but most viewed Ryswick as only a pause in hostilities.\nQuestion: France and Spain signed the Treaty of Ryswick due to what reasons?",

Though ordered by the Dutch government to continue saluting first, many Dutch commanders could not bear the insult. Still, the resulting flag incidents were not the casus belli as in the previous war. To provoke open conflict, James already in late 1663 had sent Robert Holmes, in service of the Royal African Company, to capture Dutch trading posts and colonies in West Africa.:67  At the same time, the English invaded the Dutch colony of New Netherland in North America on 24 June 1664, and had control of it by October. The Dutch responded by sending a fleet under Michiel de Ruyter that recaptured their African trade posts, captured most English trade stations there and then crossed the Atlantic for a punitive expedition against the English in America.:68 In December 1664, the English suddenly attacked the Dutch Smyrna fleet.  Though the attack failed, the Dutch in January 1665 allowed their ships to open fire on English warships in the colonies when threatened.

In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium. The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights. For example, CBS paid US$375 million for the American broadcast rights of the 1998 Winter Olympics, while NBC spent US$3.5 billion for the American rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012. In 2011, NBC agreed to a $4.38 billion contract with the International Olympic Committee to broadcast the Olympics through the 2020 Summer Olympics, the most expensive television rights deal in Olympic history.

On 1 December 1656, he signed an alliance with Ferdinand III of Habsburg in Vienna, essentially a declaration of Ferdinand III's intend to mediate a peace rather than provide military aid, which did not come into effect until Ferdinand's death on 2 April 1657. The treaty was however renewed and amended on 27 May by Ferdinand's successor Leopold I of Habsburg, who agreed in Vienna to provide John II Casimir with 12,000 troops maintained at Polish expense; in return, Leopold received Kraków and Posen in pawn. Receiving the news, Frederick III of Denmark promptly declared war on Sweden, and by June the Austrian army entered the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the south, immediately stabilizing the situation in southern Poland, while Denmark attacked Swedish Bremen-Verden and turned to Jämtland and Västergötland in July. When Charles X Gustav left the Commonwealth and headed westwards for an anti-Danish counterstrike, the Swedish-Brandenburgian-Transylvanian alliance broke apart. Rákóczi of Transylvania was unable to withstand the combined Austrian and Polish-Lithuanian forces without Swedish support, and after a pursuit into Ukraine he was encircled and forced to capitulate, with the rest of the Transylvanian army defeated by the Tartars. Brandenburg changed sides in return for Polish withdrawal of claims to Ducal Prussia, declaring Frederick William the sole sovereign in the Duchy with the treaties of Wehlau on 19 September and Bromberg on 6 November. In addition, the aforementioned treaties secured Brandenburg the Lands of Lauenburg and Bütow at the border of Brandenburgian Pomerania, while the Bishopric of Ermeland was returned to Poland.\nQuestion: How many years do these events span for?",

The war was fought on the one side by Švitrigaila, allied with the Teutonic Knights, and on the other by Sigismund Kęstutaitis, backed by the Kingdom of Poland. The war threatened to sever the Union of Krewo, the personal union between Poland and Lithuania. Švitrigaila's alliance with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Paul von Rusdorf, launched the Polish-Teutonic War  but failed to secure victory for Švitrigaila. When Sigismund captured power in Lithuania by staging a coup in 1432, Lithuania split into two opposing camps, and there began three years of devastating hostilities. To prevent the Knights from continuing their support of Švitrigaila, Poland backed a Hussite invasion of Prussia in 1433. The war ended in a decisive defeat for Švitrigaila and his ally, the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights, at the Battle of Pabaiskas in September 1435. Švitrigaila eventually surrendered in 1437; Sigismund Kęstutaitis ruled Lithuania for only eight years before he was assassinated in 1440.\nQuestion: The the Polish-Teutonic War happen before or after the start of the Lithuanian Civl War?",

It would also be the coldest game the Bears would play in 2015. In 14 games, the two teams split the series, though the Broncos won the most recent game in 2011 13-10. In the last game at Soldier Field, the Bears won 37-34. The offense took on one of the league's top defenses, Denver's pass rush leading the NFL in sacks with 32, with twelve players with at least .5 sacks. The Broncos defense was allowing the fewest average yards with 277.3, while also allowing the third-least points per game with 18.7. Despite DeMarcus Ware being out with a back injury, the Broncos still had Von Miller, who had more than five sacks in 2015. For the Bears, despite Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal's injuries, Martellus Bennett and Zach Miller could still play a role. If passing, Cutler had to watch for defensive lineman Malik Jackson, who had four pass breakups in the previous four games. When the Bears decide to run, they faced a run defense that led the league in multiple categories, including sack percentage. The Broncos offense was without Peyton Manning, and in his place was Brock Osweiler. Osweiler, who had 305 career passing yards, had only played in garbage time during his NFL career, but fits Gary Kubiak's West Coast offense. Jeff Joniak believed with Osweiler, the Broncos' plays, which consisted of 64 percent passes, would decrease, though tight ends Owen Daniels and Vernon Davis could be targeted more often. Meanwhile, Denver's rushing attack was struggling during the season, with an average of 86 rushing yards per game, 29th-ranked in the NFL. The Broncos won the coin toss and deferred until the second half. After the Bears punted, Osweiler threw a pass to Demaryius Thomas, who escaped Chris Prosinski to score on the 48-yard play. After both teams exchanged punts, the Bears scored their first points of the game in the second quarter with Robbie Gould's 46-yard field goal, and narrowed the margin to one point when Gould scored on a 37-yard kick. Denver and Chicago traded punts again, but the former scored with Brandon McManus' 24-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter to make the score 10-6. The first three drives of the second half ended with punts, though the first turnover of the game occurred on the next series, when Cutler's pass for receiver Marquess Wilson was intercepted by Danny Trevathan. However, the Broncos failed to capitalize when Ronnie Hillman was tripped by Osweiler's feet on fourth down. Afterwards, aided by two consecutive 29-yard plays (via Brandon Marshall's defensive pass interference, followed by Wilson's 29-yard catch), the Bears reached the Broncos' 19-yard line, where Gould eventually kicked a 37-yard field goal. The Broncos later increased their lead by eight when Osweiler threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Cody Latimer. On the Bears' next series, Cutler capitalized on a late hit by T. J. Ward and a 40-yard pass to Wilson to reach the Broncos' seven-yard line. Despite reaching as far as the four, the Bears turned the ball over on downs with three consecutive incomplete passes. Although Denver punted again and the Chicago offense reaching the Broncos' 33-yard line, Cutler was hit from behind by Marshall while throwing, and the ball was intercepted by Malik Jackson. The Broncos were forced to punt again, and with 1:25 left in the game, the Bears drove 65 yards, where Jeremy Langford scored on a two-yard run. However, Langford was stopped short on the two-point conversion, and on the onside kick, Thomas recovered. Osweiler kneeled once to end the game. The Bears ended the game with no penalties for the first time since 1995 against the Philadelphia Eagles and becoming the 24th team to do so in the last 15 years; the Bears also became the first team to accomplish the feat in a loss since the 2013 Packers' loss to the Bears in week nine.

Played just days after the storm made landfall on the east coast, the blackouts and flooding even affected the visiting Steelers' travel schedule, and the team would be forced to fly into the area on the morning of the contest as opposed to the usual day beforehand. Both teams traded possessions through the first quarter before Steelers' wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger three minutes into the second period. A Shaun Suisham extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead. The hometown Giants answered, tying up the game with a 1-yard run by Andre Brown. Shortly after, with around five minutes remaining in the half, New York's Osi Umenyiora was able to knock the ball from Roethlisberger's hand as the quarterback was attempting a pass. Giants linebacker Michael Boley took full advantage of the turnover, scooping up the fumble and giving the Giants a 14-7 lead on a 70-yard touchdown return. The Steelers were able to put together a final drive of the half, and a 30-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham narrowed the Giants' lead to four points at the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes extended the home team's lead by three via a 50-yard field goal. With a minute to go in the period, Tynes would successfully convert a 23-yard attempt and give the Giants a ten-point lead with a quarter to play. A 51-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Mike Wallace would cut into the Giants' lead less than a minute into the fourth. New York would fail to accumulate any further points in the contest and, despite a botched fake field goal attempt by the Steelers, a 1-yard touchdown run by Pittsburgh back Isaac Redman gave the Steelers the lead and, eventually, the win.\nQuestion: How many yards of touchdowns were scored in the first half?",

Glover Quin picked off a Bridgewater pass and returned it to the Vikings 11-yard line. Two plays later, Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate with a 7-yard TD pass. On Minnesota's next possession, Bridgewater was intercepted again, this time by Darius Slay. That led to a 29-yard Matt Prater field goal, cutting Minnesota's lead to 14-10 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Lions inched closer on a 30-yard Prater field goal, making the score 14-13. It appeared the Vikings would extend their lead when Blair Walsh lined up for a 26-yard field goal try, but Jason Jones partially blocked the kick, and it sailed wide. The Lions went ahead on their next possession when Prater made good on a 33-yard field goal. The final score remained 16-14 Lions, as Minnesota failed to score on its final two possessions. The win gave the Lions a 10-4 record for the first time since 1991 (and only the third time in franchise history, the other being 1970), their fourth consecutive division win (keeping them undefeated in the NFC North), and put them back in first place since Green Bay lost to Buffalo earlier in the day.\nQuestion: How many interceptions did Bridgewater throw in the first half?",

On 12 December 1575, after an interregnum of roughly one and a half years, primate of Poland Jakub Uchański, representing a pro-Habsburg faction, declared Emperor Maximilian II as the new monarch. However, chancellor Jan Zamoyski and other opponents of Habsburgs persuaded many of the lesser nobility to demand a Piast king, a Polish king. After a heated discussion, it was decided that Anna Jagiellon, sister of the former King Sigismund II Augustus, should be elected King of Poland and marry Stephen Báthory. In January 1576 Báthory passed the mantle of Voivode of Transylvania to his brother Christopher Báthory and departed for Poland.

Particularly damaging to the Free State's economy was the systematic destruction of railway infrastructure and roads by the Republicans. In addition, the cost to the Free State of waging the war came to another £17 million. By September 1923, Deputy Hogan estimated the cost at £50 million. The new State ended 1923 with a budget deficit of over £4 million. This weakened financial situation meant that the new state could not pay its share of Imperial debt under the treaty.

Kantakouzenos and Umur raided Bulgaria, and then turned against Momchil. The latter had exploited the power vacuum in the Rhodope, an effective no man's land between the Serbs, Bulgarians and Byzantines, to set himself up as a quasi-independent prince, supported by a substantial force of around 5,000 men. On 7 July 1345, the two armies clashed at Peritheorion. Momchil's army was crushed, and he himself fell in the field. Soon afterwards, Dušan arrived before Serres and laid siege to the city. Rejecting demands by Kantakouzenos to withdraw, a clash appeared inevitable until the murder of Alexios Apokaukos in Constantinople forced Kantakouzenos to direct his attention there.\nQuestion: At which battle did Momchil die?",

Entering the game, the Bears held a 96-71-5 lead over the Lions, though the Lions had won the last six meetings; Chicago's last victory had been a 26-21 win in 2012. The first divisional game of the year, the Bears had struggled against NFC North teams in recent years; of their last 18 divisional matchups, they lost 14, including seven of the last nine at home. In his Keys to the Game, Jeff Joniak stated the Bears offense, once again with Brian Hoyer starting at quarterback in place of a still-healing Jay Cutler, had to hold off Teryl Austin's blitzes; the Lions had the second-highest number of blitzes in the league. While Detroit's top pass rusher Ezekiel Ansah was nursing an ankle injury, substitute Kerry Hyder recorded four sacks in his place. Joniak added the Bears could attack linebacker Tahir Whitehead, who had allowed three touchdown passes in 2016. Against a Detroit offense led by quarterback Matthew Stafford, the Bears needed to contain his targets like Marvin Jones, who had excelled over the course of the 2016 season, Pro Bowler Golden Tate, the experienced Anquan Boldin and young tight end Eric Ebron. As in previous games, third down was a critical factor in the game, Joniak stating the defense \"must get off the field.\" After both teams exchanged punts on their first drives, the Bears scored first when Hoyer threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal despite being covered by Nevin Lawson. The next six series of the game ended in punts, the trend ending when the Bears were stopped on fourth down in Lions territory midway through the second quarter; Detroit eventually gained three points when Matt Prater kicked a 50-yard field goal. Connor Barth attempted his own 50-yard field goal on the next drive, but missed it wide right. With 16 seconds left in the first half, Stafford's pass for Tate was intercepted by Jacoby Glenn. The Bears were unable to turn the turnover into points as the half ended before they could score. Upon receiving the ball for the start of the second half, the Lions scored on Prater's 21-yard field goal, which the Bears responded on their following drive with Hoyer's six-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller; the drive gained momentum when Royal recorded a 64-yard pass play, the Bears' longest play from scrimmage of the season. The Lions punted again and the Bears were able to extend their lead with their fourth quarter drive culminating in Barth's 25-yard field goal. With 4:03 left in the game, Stafford's pass for Boldin was intercepted by Deiondre' Hall, but the Lions retaliated when Andre Roberts returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown. The Lions closed the margin to just three points when Stafford completed the two-point conversion to Tate. With the score now 17-14, the Lions attempted an onside kick, but Sam Acho recovered.

In 1417 in Constance, Louis insulted Henry by calling him \"the son of a cook\". When Louis then accused Henry of having shed human blood, Henry and fifteen of his followers physically attacked Louis and injured him severely. After this attack, Louis described Henry as a pluethunt , which did little to defuse the conflict. Henry XVI evaded punishment for the attack on Louis VII only through the intercession of Frederick of Brandenburg and his cousins Dukes Ernest and William III in Munich and especially by paying 6000 guilders to King Sigismund.

On September 12, 1698, Taganrog was founded there, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy. Although the campaign was a success, it was evident to Peter I of Russia that he achieved only partial results, since his fleet was bottled up in the Sea of Azov due to Crimean and Ottoman control of the Strait of Kerch. A regular navy and specialists who could build and navigate military ships were necessary for resisting the Ottoman attacks. On October 20, 1696, the Boyar Duma decreed the creation of the regular Imperial Russian Navy; this date is considered to be the birthdate of the Russian Navy. The first shipbuilding program consisted of 52 vessels. In 1697, a Russian ambassador present at the Safavid court raised an issue by handing over a note which stipulated that \"Lezgi, Circassian, and other Caucasian tribesmen, ostensibly Persian subjects\", had provided assistance to the Ottomans during the Azov campaigns.

By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between - essentially Petén and much of Belize - independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated.\nQuestion: How many total years did the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala last?",

In 2001, the livestock population in Afghanistan had declined by about 40% since 1998. In 2002, this figure was estimated to have declined further to 60%. An FAO survey done in the northern regions in spring 2002 showed that in four provinces (Balkh Province, Jowzjan Province, Sar-e Pol Province, and Faryab Province), there was a loss of about 84% of cattle from 1997 to 2002 and around 80% of sheep and goat. The majority of Afghans traditionally raise sheep instead of goats because goat meat is not popular in Afghanistan. After 2002, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation & Livestock (Afghanistan) with assistance from USAID have been helping to regrow livestock numbers throughout the country. This was done by providing Afghan villagers training and animals to start with. The Council of Ministers (Afghanistan) Mohammad Asef Rahimi stated that over the past decade arable land had increased from 2.1 million hectares to 8.1 million hectares, wheat production from 5.1 million tonnes to 2.3 million tonnes, nurseries from 75,000 hectares to 119,000 hectares and grape production from 364,000 tonnes to 615,000 tonnes.

The Packers moved down the field with ease on their first possession, with Rodgers completing a 27-yard pass to Jordy Nelson followed by Eddie Lacy's 16-yard run. However, the drive stalled when Aaron Rodgers was sacked by Shea McClellin on 3rd and 8, so the Packers settled for a 30-yard field goal for the 3-0 lead. Josh McCown then led a drive that ended with a 23-yard TD pass to Brandon Marshall, taking a 7-3 lead. It soon became apparent that Aaron Rodgers couldn't return to the game because of an injury suffered on the McClellin sack. Instead, Seneca Wallace trotted onto the field on the Packers' second possession. It ended with a tipped pass that was intercepted by Julius Peppers. The Bears' punt after their 3-and-out was blocked by Jamari Lattimore and recovered by Chris Banjo, taking possession at the Chicago 32. On the very next play, James Starks bursted through the middle for a 32-yard TD run, taking a 10-7 lead. In the 2nd quarter, the Bears took a 14-10 lead following a 1-yard run by Matt Forte.

The Packers successfully recover the ensuing onside kick, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal to take a 20-17 lead. The Bears responded with a 6-yard TD pass to Alshon Jeffery, taking a 24-20 lead.

When Blanche died in 1441, John retained the government of her lands and dispossessed his own eldest son, Charles , who was made Prince of Viana in 1423. John tried to assuage his son with the lieutenancy of Navarre, but his son's French upbringing and French allies, the Beaumonteses, brought the two into conflict. In the early 1450s they were engaged in open warfare in Navarre. Charles was captured and released; and John tried to disinherit him by illegally naming his daughter Eleanor, who was married to Gaston IV of Foix, his successor. In 1451 John's new wife, Juana Enríquez, gave birth to a son, Ferdinand. In 1452 Charles fled his father first for France, later for the court of his uncle, John's elder brother, Alfonso V at Naples. From 1454 John governed his brother's Spanish realms—the Crown of Aragon—as lieutenant. When Alfonso died in 1458, Charles was arrested and brought to Majorca. John succeeded Alfonso as ruler of the Crown of Aragon. In his will John named Charles as his heir. Among John's early unpopular acts was to quit the war against Genoa, upsetting the merchants of Barcelona. He also refused to aid his nephew, Ferdinand I of Naples, in securing his throne.\nQuestion: How many years ago did the war start compared to when Blanche died?",

Ten years later, in 1498, Vasco da Gama led the first fleet around Africa to India, arriving in Calicut and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India.

When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors. These school closures may also have been brought about by restrictions on who can attend English schools, which has been another ongoing drain on the English school system. Of the Anglophones between 25 and 44 years old who left the province between 1981 and 1986, 15000 individuals, which was half of this group, had university degrees. The provinces unemployment rate rose from 8.7 percent in 1976 to 10.4 percent in 1977, remaining above 10 percent for 19 of the last 23 years of the 20th century.

The Constable of Castile moved his troops  southwest from Burgos to meet with the Admiral's forces near Tordesillas.  Meanwhile, the comuneros reinforced their troops at Torrelobatón, which was far less secure than the comuneros preferred.  Their forces were suffering from desertions, and the presence of royalist artillery would make Torrelobatón's castle vulnerable.  Juan de Padilla considered withdrawing to Toro to seek reinforcements in early April, but wavered.  He delayed his decision until the early hours of April 23, losing considerable time and allowing the royalists to unite their forces in Peñaflor. The combined royalist army pursued the comuneros. Again, the royalists had a strong advantage in cavalry, with their army consisting of 6,000 infantry and 2,400 cavalry against Padilla's 7,000 infantry and 400 cavalry.  Heavy rain slowed Padilla's infantry more than the royalist cavalry and rendered the primitive firearms of the rebels' 1,000 arquebusiers nearly useless.  Padilla hoped to reach the relative safety of Toro and the heights of Vega de Valdetronco, but his infantry was too slow.  He gave battle with the harrying royalist cavalry at the town of Villalar.  The cavalry charges scattered the rebel ranks, and the battle became a slaughter.  There were an estimated 500-1,000 rebel casualties and many desertions. The three most important leaders of the rebellion were captured: Juan de Padilla, Juan Bravo, and Francisco Maldonado.  They were beheaded the next morning in the Plaza of Villalar, with a large portion of the royalist nobility present.

After linebacker Wesley Woodyard recovered a Rivers' fumble deep in Chargers' territory, the Broncos increased their lead, with Manning throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Decker. However, the Chargers responded late in the third quarter, with Rivers connecting on an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Danario Alexander. A pair of field goals by Prater in the fourth quarter&#8212;from 30 and 32 yards&#8212;gave the Broncos a 30-16 lead with 4:14 remaining in the game. The Chargers tried to rally, with a 21-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to Alexander with 1:24 remaining. However, the Broncos' recovered the onside kick, and subsequently ran out the clock. With the win, the Broncos earned their first season sweep of the Chargers since 2005, and snapped the Chargers' three-game winning streak in Denver. Nate Irving's block of a Mike Scifres' punt marked the first time since 2007 that the Broncos' special teams blocked a punt. This was the only game during the 2012 season in which the Broncos wore their alternate navy blue jerseys. Running back Willis McGahee suffered a ruptured MCL and compression fracture in his right knee during the second quarter, when his knee was hit by the helmet of Chargers' cornerback Quentin Jammer. On November 21, McGahee was placed on the injured reserve/designated for return list.\nQuestion: How many points did the chargers get in the third quarter?",

This trend did not continue, and by the summer of 1990, the Afghan government forces were on the defensive again. By the beginning of 1991, the government controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, the eleven-year Siege of Khost had ended in a mujahideen victory and the morale of the Afghan military finally collapsed. In the Soviet Union, Kryuchkov and Shevardnadze had both supported continuing aid to the Najibullah government, but Kryuchkov had been arrested following the failed 1991 Soviet coup détat attempt and Shevardnadze had resigned from his posts in the Soviet government in December 1990 - there were no longer any pro-Najibullah people in the Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union was in the middle of an economic and political crisis, which would lead directly to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. At the same time Boris Yeltsin became Russias new hope, and he had no wish to continue to aid Najibullahs government, which he considered a relic of the past. In the autumn of 1991, Najibullah wrote to Shevardnadze \"I didnt want to be president, you talked me into it, insisted on it, and promised support.

This meant to put an end to local particularism, which was seen first in the violent suppression of the Hauran Druze Rebellion in Syria in 1909. During the Syrian rebellion, the Ottomans succeeded in suppressing the Jabal Druze revolt after conquering the villages, forcibly registering villagers and disarming them, collecting taxes in cash or cattle, and conscripting 1000 men into the Ottoman army. Ottoman governor Sami Pasha al-Faruqi wanted to apply same measures in Transjordan: villages in Ajlun were encircled by 400 Ottoman soldiers who disarmed the villagers and took 85 conscripts. Governmental troops in Al-Salt and Madaba issued identity papers as a prelude to conscription. Sami Pasha sent a telegram on 6 November 1910 from Jabal Druze to the Al-Karak Mutasarrıf Muhemet Tahir Pasha, requesting that the residents of the town demonstrate their loyalty to the Empire by ceding their weapons and submitting to personal registration. This was seen differently by the local population; measures of disarmament and conscription. The Mutasarrıf conveyed the message to the residents, who responded by requesting that they be allowed to keep their weapons for protection against Bedouin raiders. Sami Pasha assured them that the state would only conduct registration of people and lands but sent a large number of troops into the area, undermining his credibility.\nQuestion: How could citizens pay their taxes?",
