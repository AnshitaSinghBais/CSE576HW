The Cowboys, in an attempt to not repeat the mistakes of the previous week, sent Dan Bailey out to kick a field goal to trail 17-20 early in the 4th. The Redskins extended their lead to 23-17 after another field goal. At the 3:29 mark, the Cowboys went back to work to start at their own 13 yard line. Romo led the Cowboys downfield thanks in large part to a Terrance Williams 51 yard catch and then a Dez Bryant catch and run for 17 yards to set up first and goal at the Redskins' 4 yard line. DeMarco Murray carried the ball for all three plays (+3, no gain, -9). Facing 4th and goal at the Washington 10 yard line,  Tony Romo climbed the pocket and fired a pass to DeMarco Murray in the end zone to tie the game 23-23. With the extra point good, the Cowboys led 24-23 with 1:01 remaining in the game. Washington started their drive on their own 13 yard line after a 10-yard illegal block penalty negated what would have been a 21-yard return (to the WAS 23). Kirk Cousins and co. could not sustain their drive, totaling 4 yards on four passing attempts. The Redskins turned the ball over on downs with 40 seconds remaining in the game. Lining up in the victory formation, Tony Romo was able to kneel the ball down and run the clock out. With the win, the Cowboys advanced to 5-0 in the NFC East and kept their playoff hopes alive to set up a do-or-die at home versus the Eagles. Romo was seen limping through most of the fourth quarter after rolling out of what would have been a sack by Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson. The Cowboys later confirmed injury reports of Romo suffering a herniated disc in his lower back. Despite statements that he will be ready to face Nick Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles for the NFC East Championship, Romo was placed on Injured Reserve.

On the other hand, Venice had lost its greatest and most prosperous colony, its pre-eminent trading position in the Mediterranean had diminished, and its treasury was exhausted, having spent some 4,253,000 ducats on the defense of Candia alone. To all this, the Dalmatian gains were insufficient compensation. Upon his return to Venice in 1670, Morosini was tried on charges of insubordination and treason, but was acquitted. Fifteen years later, he would lead the Venetian forces in the Morean War, where the Republic attempted, for the last time, to reverse its losses and reestablish itself as one of the major powers of the Eastern Mediterranean. During that war, in 1692, a Venetian fleet attempted to retake Candia, but failed. The last Venetian strongholds off Crete fell in the last Turkish-Venetian War in 1715. Crete would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state. The island continued under nominal Ottoman suzerainty until the Balkan Wars. In their aftermath, the Ottoman Sultan dropped any claim on the island, and on 1 December 1913 it was formally united to Greece. Following the fall of Candia, fears rose that the Ottomans would attack Malta. In 1670, the Order of St. John began to improve the island's defences with the construction of the Cottonera Lines and Fort Ricasoli.\nQuestion: What happened first, Crete becoming an autonomous state or Crete formally uniting to Greece?",

This would become relevant a decade later in 1700, when King Charles II died without a son.  Charles' death triggered the War of the Spanish Succession.  The two claimants were the French Philip, Duke of Anjou and the Austrian Emperor Leopold I.  The Spanish government chose Philip; French King Louis XIV, Philip's grandfather, naturally supported his grandson as well.  The Catalan upper classes, still distrustful of France from its efforts to stir the peasantry against them in 1689, had no love for Philip.  He was \"a king chosen by Castilians.\"  In 1702, the cortes voted to recognize Leopold as king, and full-scale rebellion against Philip began in 1705 with the arrival of supporting Austrian troops.  The war would continue for nine more years, until the Siege of Barcelona in 1714 when the last remaining Catalan supporters of Leopold were defeated by the combined Franco-Castilian army.  The Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip from 1707-1714, ended the nominal split between Castile and Aragon and eliminated the traditional autonomy Aragon had kept.

The Vikings took the ball and marched right down the field 80 yards in just 7 plays, with Cassel finding Matt Asiata on a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead just over four minutes into game. This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety Devin McCourty intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, Stevan Ridley scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10-7 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to Darrelle Revis at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17-7. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but Chandler Jones blocked Blair Walsh's field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24-7 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27-7. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30-7 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie Dominique Easley intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game. Brady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be. Stevan Ridley led the Patriots in rushing, carrying the ball 25 times for 101 yards and a touchdown. Filling in for the suspended Adrian Peterson, Matt Asiata carried the ball 13 times for only 36 yards. Matt Cassel went 19 of 36 for 202 yards with 1 touchdown, but was intercepted 4 times by the Patriots.\nQuestion: How many incomplete passes did Brady throw?",

The series had been a see-saw in victors, with the winning team alternating each time; the Bears won the most recent game in 2013 23-20, but the Ravens won the latest game in Baltimore (a 31-7 rout in 2009). For the Bears offense, the unit hoped to provide more support for Mitchell Trubisky in his first NFL away game. \"The kid's going to be special and we've got to do our jobs around him; keep getting in the right spot, make plays and catch the football, and making sure we're keeping him out of first-and-17s,\" offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains stated. \"We have a lot of faith and confidence in Mitchell.\" To do this, USA Today's Lorin Cox wrote the offensive line needed to stop Ravens nose tackle Michael Pierce, whose 13 stops in 2017 tied for fifth among defensive linemen. On defense, the Bears entered the game with the sixth-ranked defense (allowing 305 yards per game) that also ranked ninth in average yards allowed per play (5.07). With Danny Trevathan returning from suspension, the defense faced a Ravens offense that ranked sixth in rushing with 130.4 yards per game. On the other hand, Baltimore's offensive line - particularly the guards - had been struggling due to injuries, and Cox wrote the defense should take advantage of the openings. While the Bears had yet to record an interception in 2017, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco had thrown 33 in his last 31 games, including one in ten consecutive games; Cox added, \"It's up to this defense to actually finish the turnover.\" The first five drives of the game ended with punts. The Bears opted for a run-based attack for much of the game; on their first scoring drive in the second quarter, all but one play was a run, with the series ending on Connor Barth's 24-yard field goal. On the Ravens' next drive, Maxx Williams was stripped by Christian Jones and Trevathan recovered the loose ball. Although the Bears were unable to capitalize on the takeaway, the defense recorded another turnover on the next drive when Bryce Callahan intercepted Flacco's pass intended for Breshad Perriman. On a halfback option, Tarik Cohen eventually threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller to put the Bears up 10-0. Justin Tucker kicked a 27-yard field goal to put the Ravens on the scoreboard with three seconds remaining in the first half. During the third quarter, Trubisky led a 66-yard drive that ended with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Dion Sims. During the ensuing kickoff, Joshua Bellamy appeared to trip Ravens kick returner Bobby Rainey, but Rainey instead got back up and ran 96 yards for a touchdown. Upon review, the referees determined Bellamy's hand did not touch Rainey. Subsequently, the Bears committed two turnovers: Cohen fumbled at the Bears' 39-yard line - which set up Tucker's 31-yard field goal to narrow the gap to four points - and Trubisky was strip-sacked by Lardarius Webb with C. J. Mosley recovering. The Ravens reached the Bears' 30-yard line, where Flacco was intercepted by Adrian Amos, who returned his first career interception 90 yards for the touchdown to put the Bears up by 11 points with 5:08 left in the game. However, Tucker kicked a 50-yard field goal with 2:53 remaining, while Michael Campanaro scored on a 77-yard punt return touchdown and Flacco completed the two-point conversion to Nick Boyle to tie the game at 24 apiece and enter overtime. Neither team was able to score on their first drive; on Chicago's second series, the offense was pinned at its own seven-yard line. Jordan Howard recorded a 53-yard run on the first play of the possession, which was later followed by Trubisky's 18-yard pass to Kendall Wright on third down to draw the Bears closer. Barth kicked a 40-yard field goal to win the game. It was the Bears' first road victory since 2015 against the Buccaneers, breaking a ten-game losing streak. The Bears' rushing attack resulted in a career high 167 rushing yards on 36 carries for Howard, while Cohen had 14 carries for 32 yards. Trubisky threw just 16 passes, completing eight for 113 yards and a touchdown. John Fox explained the Ravens were the reason for the run-based strategy, having used the same philosophy with the 2012 Denver Broncos; in that team's game against Baltimore, the Broncos ran 44 times against just 21 passing plays despite the presence of Peyton Manning.\nQuestion: How many yards longer was Barth's second field goal over his first one?",

Nobunaga agreed and rewarded the men. By this time Oda was at the height of his power. He controlled most of central Japan, including all of the territories that bordered Iga. He was therefore able to assemble a large army which attacked the province from all directions: 1. 10,000 men under the command of Nobukatsu and Tsuda Nobusumi entering from Ise  to the southeast.2. 12,000 men under Niwa Nagahide and Takigawa Kazumasu entering from Tsuge to the northeast.3. 7,000 men under Gamō Ujisato and Wakisaka Yasuharu entering from Tamataki to the north.4. 3,700 men under Tsutsui Junkei entering from Kasama to the southwest.5. 7,000 men under Asano Nagamasa entering from Hase to the southwest.6. 2,300 men under Hori Hidemasa entering from Tarao to the northwest. Against this large army of 42,000 men, the Iga defenders only totaled 10,000 at most, and these were spread throughout the province.

Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and the bulk of his army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring at the head of an army of 20,000 men. Kantakouzenos and Umur raided Bulgaria, and then turned against Momchil. The latter had exploited the power vacuum in the Rhodope, an effective no man's land between the Serbs, Bulgarians and Byzantines, to set himself up as a quasi-independent prince, supported by a substantial force of around 5,000 men. On 7 July 1345, the two armies clashed at Peritheorion. Momchil's army was crushed, and he himself fell in the field. Soon afterwards, Dušan arrived before Serres and laid siege to the city.

According to contemporary pro-Dušan sources, evil advisors turned Uroš III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Dušan of his inheritance. Uroš III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Dušan had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uroš III ordered Dušan to meet him. Dušan feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Dušan marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father. Uroš III fled, and Dušan captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petrić. On 21 August 1331, Uroš III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Dušan's advisors, he was imprisoned. Dušan was crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime lands in the first week of September. The civil war had prevented Serbia from aiding Ivan Stephen and Anna Neda in Bulgaria, who were deposed in March 1331, taking refuge in the mountains. Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria feared for the danger of Serbia as the situation there had settled, and immediately sought peace with Dušan.

Jeff Joniak stated the Bears must \"play smart\"; for instance, on offense, the Bears would have to watch for pressure from a blitz-happy Mike Zimmer-led defense, which ranked third in the league in sacks with 30, 20 of which were in their last four games, and was also ranked third in the NFL in hurries with 60, and forced offenses to commit a league-leading 13 holding penalties. The pass rush would try to attack Jay Cutler, who was tied for the most turnovers with 15, and was sacked 23 times. On first down, the Vikings blitzed 32 percent of the time, and 38 percent on third down. The Vikings also ranked fourth against the pass, allowing 213.6 yards per game. The Vikings had also improved on points allowed, allowing 18.3 points in their last four games after permitting 30.0 in the previous four. However, the Vikings' rush defense was allowing 5 yards per carry on first down. Defensively, the Bears were struggling, allowing a league-most 30.8 points per game while ranking 28th against the pass, allowing 268.6 yards per game. Despite Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson being suspended for the game, Matt Asiata and Jerick McKinnon had seven runs of 20 yards or more, and the latter averaged 5.0 yards per carry. In the passing game, the Vikings struggled without tight end Kyle Rudolph, but he made his return in week eleven. Rookie quarterback Teddy Bridgewater was average in terms of accuracy and arm strength, having completed 53.9 percent of his passes, including 66 percent on third down, and while Greg Jennings had caught 60 percent of targets, Cordarrelle Patterson only caught 46 percent. The Vikings' third down offense also struggled without Rudolph and Peterson, with a 36.5 conversion percentage, and at the line, Matt Kalil had allowed a league-high 12 sacks. Both teams had struggled in moving the ball downfield, with the Bears and Vikings having 32 and 33 drives start inside their own 20-yard lines, respectively, and the latter being the second-most in the NFL. On such drives, Chicago had a touchdown, 14 points, and six turnovers, while Minnesota had no touchdowns, 6 points, and four turnovers. Josh Morgan, Terrance Mitchell, Darryl Sharpton, Eben Britton, Jordan Mills, Trevor Scott, and Blake Annen were the Bears' inactive players. The Bears won the toss, and elected to defer. On their opening drive, the Vikings scored on Blair Walsh's 50-yard field goal. During the Bears' next drive, a play was whistled dead because Minnesota wanted to challenge whether a previous play was a fumble, and when Cutler voiced his complaints to the referees, he was penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct; the ruling eventually stood, costing the Vikings their first timeout. The Bears later attempted to tie the score with Robbie Gould's 47-yard field goal, but missed the kick wide right. Later in the quarter, the Vikings extended their lead by ten with Bridgewater's seven-yard touchdown pass to Rhett Ellison. The Bears' next drive lasted into the second quarter, and ended on the fourth play of the quarter with Cutler's 27-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. After both teams exchanged punts, the Bears were pinned on their own 27-yard line after a 20-yard illegal block penalty on Christian Jones. However, the Bears were able to reach the Vikings' 44-yard line, where Cutler threw a touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, who outjumped Robinson for the catch; the score gave the Bears the 14-10 lead, the first time the Bears had led since week six against the Falcons, snapping a 207-minute, 11 second lead-less streak. After the Vikings punted again, the Bears' final possession of the first half ended after three plays: with 15 seconds remaining, the Bears called their final timeout of the half, and on the next play, Cutler was intercepted by Xavier Rhodes on a long pass to Jeffery. Bridgewater kneeled once to end the half. In the second half, the Bears started on their own 17-yard line, but reached the Vikings' one-yard line on 12 plays. On 4th and 1, Cutler attempted a quarterback sweep, but was tackled for no gain by Tom Johnson. After the Vikings punted, the Bears' following drive was ended when Cutler, attempting to avoid pressure from Johnson, had his pass for Martellus Bennett intercepted by Harrison Smith, who returned the pick 52 yards to the Chicago 27-yard line. However, the Vikings failed to capitalize on the takeaway, and at the Bears' 20-yard line, Walsh's field goal sailed wide right.  The Bears' responding drive went into the final quarter, and ended with Cutler's four-yard touchdown pass to Marshall, killing 7:35 on the game clock on the possession. Minnesota attempted to respond with a scoring drive, and drew within eight points with Walsh's 26-yard field goal. On Chicago's next drive, the offense ran exclusively running plays for Matt Forte, which forced the Vikings to use all three of their timeouts, and the Bears would later be forced to punt, ending a drive that burned 2:01 off the clock. On the Vikings' first play of their final drive, Bridgewater was sacked by Willie Young for a five-yard loss, though the clock was stopped by the two-minute warning. The Vikings then recorded two consecutive first downs on Bridgewater's passes of 21 and 14 yards to Charles Johnson and McKinnon, respectively, and the next pass to Johnson resulted in a seven-yard gain to the Bears' 36-yard line. With less than a minute remaining, Bridgewater attempted to throw a pass to Johnson in the endzone, but was intercepted by Ryan Mundy. Cutler kneeled once to seal the 21-13 victory. The win was the first at Soldier Field for the Bears of the 2014 season, and the first in eleven months, dating back to the October 9, 2013 game against the Dallas Cowboys.\nQuestion: How many total yards of field goals did Blair Walsh make?",

In the 2nd quarter, the Saints finally scored with a Garrett Hartley 34-yard field goal. After a defensive stance, Drew Brees threw a 40-yard touchdown to Marques Colston which tied the game 10-10. The Redskins retook the lead with Jason Campbell connecting with Devin Thomas for a 10-yard touchdown. With the Saints now down 17-10, Brees and the Saints attempted to drive the field. Brees' pass attempt to Jeremy Shockey was intercepted by Kareem Moore. Robert Meachem then ran into Moore, stripped the football, and returned it for a 44-yard touchdown. In the 3rd quarter, the Redskins kicker Suisham made a 28-yard field goal. The Redskins then extended their lead with Devin Thomas catching a 13-yard touchdown pass from Campbell.

Turner had scoring runs of 4, 1 and 2 yards, his first career game with three rushing touchdowns, while leading the Falcons with 104 yards rushing. Jerious Norwood added 75 yards rushing.Turner dragged Chiefs linebacker Pat Thomas for a few steps before breaking free and running through other defenders for a 38-yard run from the Falcons 8. A 30-yard pass from Ryan to Norwood helped set up Turner first touchdown run. Turner 1-yard scoring run in the second quarter gave Atlanta a 24-0 lead. Turner determined run helped to soften the Kansas City defense. Ryan found Roddy White for a 70-yard touchdown pass on Atlanta's next possession, and the Falcons were on their way to a big early lead, ( Ryan 70-yard touchdown pass to White is the longest pass completion for the Falcons since 12/23/07 when wide receiver Laurent Robinson caught a 74-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Chris Redman against the Arizona Cardinals in a Week 16 meeting) . On Kansas City first offensive possession of the game, defensive end John Abraham logged his fifth sack of the season, which led to a Chiefs punt. Abraham tallied his second sack of the game at the end of the third quarter, which included a forced fumble. The two sacks gave Abraham eight in his last four games, 16 in his last 18 games and 73.5 for his career. Entering the Kansas City game, he led the NFL with four sacks after three games, the forced fumble was the 29th of his career, which ranks fourth in the NFL from 2000-2008. Turner sparked an Atlanta scoring drive when he posted a 38-yard rush in the first quarter, he capped the drive with a four-yard touchdown, his third of the season. The Falcons drove 92 yards in six plays and also received help from running back Jerious Norwood on the drive who contributed with 45 combined yards (two rushes for 15 yards and one 30-yard reception).Atlanta  92-yard scoring drive, the first of the game, is the longest scoring drive since 12/3/06 at Washington when the Falcons drove 98 yards on six plays capped by a Norwood touchdown run.  Kicker Jason Elam was successful on his long field goal attempt of 27 yards against Kansas City, improving his streak of consecutive field goals to 27. Elam also added five extra points for an eight-point day. Tyler Thigpen, the third starting quarterback in three weeks for Kansas City, threw three interceptions in his first career start. The third interception, by cornerback Chris Houston, was returned 10 yards for a touchdown with 1:01 left in the game. Chiefs coach Herman Edwards said during the week he would turn to veteran Damon Huard if Thigpen struggled. Thigpen played the full game and was 14-for-36 passing for 128 yards with one touchdown. Down 24-0, Thigpen led a 13-play scoring drive capped by his 15-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Bowe  with three seconds left in the first half. The Chiefs' 12th straight loss came 11 months to the day after their last win. They lost their last nine games in 2007 after a 12-10 win at Oakland on Oct. 21, 2007. The Chiefs comeback continued when Larry Johnson's 48-yard run set up his 1-yard scoring plunge to open the second half, cutting Atlanta lead to 24-14. It was Johnson first rushing touchdown of the season.Johnson, who had 96 yards rushing in his first two games, had 24 carries for 121 yards and a touchdown. Johnson has 4,981 yards rushing for his career to pass  Christian Okoye (4,897) for second place on the Chiefs all-time list. The Falcons had a quick answer to Johnson touchdown. Ryan, making his third start, had a 15-yard run and a 17-yard pass to White to set up Turner third touchdown, a 2-yard run. The Chiefs were forced to punt on their first five possessions. Their next two drives ended with interceptions by  Erik Coleman and  Brent Grimes, Coleman intercepted his first career pass in a Falcons uniform, which also gave him the eighth of his career, it was Coleman first interception since 11/12/06 against the New England Patriots . Coleman pieced together a stellar performance against the Chiefs which included 10 tackles to lead the team and one forced fumble, and Grimes  intercepted his first career pass when he stepped in front of a Tyler Thigpen pass in the second quarter. Grimes returned the interception 25 yards, which led to a Falcons touchdown. The Falcons defense allowed only 14 rushing yards in the first quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs, continuing their trend of holding opponents to under 15 rushing yards over the first three contests of the season. Against Tampa Bay in Week 2, Atlanta held the Bucs to two rushing yards in the opening 15 minutes of play, which was the lowest total in the first quarter of a game since for a Falcons opponent since 12/14/03 (vs. Colts, two rushing yards). Below is a look at Atlanta  opponent rushing totals in the first quarter of each game this season. The Falcons moved to 2-0 at the Georgia Dome on the season and gave Head Coach Mike Smith his second career win as a head coach. Michael Turner became only the fifth Falcons running back in team history to register three or more touchdowns in a game, with the win over the Chiefs improved its record to 5-1 in its last six meetings against AFC West opponents.\nQuestion: Which players caught interceptions from Tyler Thigpen?",

The Broncos grabbed the early lead, with cornerback Aqib Talib returning an interception off Bengals' cornerback Andy Dalton 33 yards for a touchdown. However, on the first play of the Bengals' third possession, running back Jeremy Hill reeled off an 85-yard touchdown run to tie the score. The Bengals claimed the lead in the second quarter, with a 37-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. On the Broncos' next possession, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Bengals' safety Reggie Nelson, and the Bengals capitalized, with Dalton connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jermaine Gresham. A 49-yard field goal by Nugent with one minute remaining in the first half increased the Bengals' lead to 20-7. The Broncos had one last possession before halftime, however, placekicker Connor Barth missed on a 49-yard field goal attempt. On the Broncos' initial possession of the second half, return specialist Omar Bolden returned the opening kickoff to the Bengals' 21-yard line. Four plays later, running back C. J. Anderson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. However, the Bengals had a response, as Adam Jones advanced the ensuing kickoff to the Broncos' 27-yard line. Three plays later, Dalton threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Giovani Bernard. The Broncos then scored 14 unanswered points, with Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders &#8212; from 4 and 5 yards out &#8212; to give the Broncos a 28-27 lead. The second scoring play came after Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a fumble off Hill just as the Bengals were attempting to add to their lead. Rain started to fall in the fourth quarter, and on the Broncos' first fourth quarter possession, Manning was intercepted by Jones deep in Broncos' territory, however, a 15-yard taunting penalty on Nelson pushed the Bengals out of field goal range. The Broncos were forced to punt on their next possession, and return specialist Brandon Tate advanced all the way to the Broncos' 9-yard line. The Broncos defense forced the Bengals to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Nugent to give the Bengals a 30-28 lead with 7:53 remaining in the game. The two teams traded punts on their next possessions, and the Broncos attempted a rally, however, Bengals' cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick returned an interception off Manning 30 yards for a touchdown. With the rain intensifying, the Broncos had one last possession, but Manning threw another interception to Kirkpatrick, this one deep in Bengals' territory &#8212; Manning's fourth interception of the game &#8212; to seal the victory for the Bengals.

Still recovering from the civil war of 1341-1347, the emperor, with great difficulty, raised 50,000 hyperpyra from private sources  for a shipbuilding program for the expected war to come. When the tariffs and custom duties were finally lowered, merchant shipping coming through the strait bypassed Genoese Galata and diverted their ships across the Golden Horn to Byzantine Constantinople. The Genoese, financially hard-hit from this policy, declared war on the Empire, and in August 1348, a flotilla of ships sailed across the Horn and attacked the Byzantine fleet; despite their large scale preparations, the Byzantine fleet was destroyed by early 1349. The Byzantines retaliated by burning wharves and warehouses along the shore and catapulted stones and burning bales of hay into Galata, setting major parts of the city on fire. After several weeks of fighting, plenipotentiaries from Genoa came and negotiated a peace agreement. The Genoese agreed to pay a war indemnity of 100,000 hyperpyra and evacuated the land behind Galata which they illegally occupied; last, they promised never to attack Constantinople. In return the Byzantines surrendered nothing, but the Genoese custom duties remained in effect.\nQuestion: Approximately how many years did it take for the Byzantine fleet to be destroyed after August 1348?",

In the second quarter, the Cowboys retook the lead as rookie kicker Nick Folk got a 44-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run.  Dallas reclaimed the lead with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  However, due to a taunting penalty on LB Kevin Burnett, the Giants were given great field position to get some points prior to halftime.  The Cowboys held New York to a 40-yard Lawrence Tynes field goal. In the third quarter, Dallas regained the lead with Romo completing a 25-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants only got a 26-yard field goal from Tynes.  Afterwards, the Cowboys completed the season-sweep with Romo and Owens hooking up again on a 50-yard TD pass.

During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the 1995–96 Golden State Warriors season. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128–118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the 1995–96 Atlanta Hawks season.

Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber  and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610 the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island.

These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.\nQuestion: What happened first: Holy Alliance or League of the Three Emperors?",

He was \"a king chosen by Castilians.\"  In 1702, the cortes voted to recognize Leopold as king, and full-scale rebellion against Philip began in 1705 with the arrival of supporting Austrian troops.  The war would continue for nine more years, until the Siege of Barcelona in 1714 when the last remaining Catalan supporters of Leopold were defeated by the combined Franco-Castilian army.  The Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip from 1707-1714, ended the nominal split between Castile and Aragon and eliminated the traditional autonomy Aragon had kept.  Castilian law and institutions were mandated throughout Spain.\nQuestion: Did the Austrain troops arrive before or after the vote to recognize Leopold as king",

He was succeeded by Bahadur Shah I, but there was a general decline in central control over the empire during the tenure of Jahandar Shah and later emperors. Nizam-ul-Mulk established Hyderabad as an independent kingdom. A power struggle ensued after his death between his son, Nasir Jung, and his grandson, Muzaffar Jung, which was the opportunity France and England needed to interfere in Indian politics. France aided Muzaffar Jung while England aided Nasir Jung. Several erstwhile Mughal territories were autonomous such as the Carnatic, ruled by Nawab Dost Ali Khan, despite being under the legal purview of the Nizam of Hyderabad. French and English interference included those of the affairs of the Nawab. Dost Ali's death sparked a power struggle between his son-in-law Chanda Sahib, supported by the French, and Muhammad Ali, supported by the English. One major instigator of the Carnatic Wars was the Frenchman Joseph François Dupleix, who arrived in India in 1715, rising to become the French East India Company's governor in 1742. Dupleix sought to expand French influence in India, which was limited to a few trading outposts, the chief one being Pondicherry on the Coromandel Coast. Immediately upon his arrival in India, he organized Indian recruits under French officers for the first time, and engaged in intrigues with local rulers to expand French influence. However, he was met by the equally challenging and determined young officer from the British Army, Robert Clive. \"The Austrian War of Succession in 1740 and later the war in 1756 automatically led to a conflict in India...and British reverses during the American War of Independence  in the 1770s had an impact on events in India.\"\nQuestion: Was Robert Clive French or British?",

The country had large budget deficits year after year, and was largely dependent on borrowed money. Russia's war effort was funded primarily by France, in a series of loans totalling 800 million francs ; another loan in the amount of 600 million francs was agreed upon, but later cancelled. These loans were extended within a climate of mass bribing of the French press . Although initially reluctant to participate in the war, the French government and major banks were co-operative since it became clear that Russian and French economic interests were tied. In addition to French money, Russia secured a loan in the amount of 500 million marks  from Germany, who also financed Japan's war effort. Conversely, Japan's pre-war gold reserves were a modest 11.7 million pounds; a major portion of the total cost of the war was covered by money borrowed from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. During his canvassing expedition in London, the Japanese vice-governor of the Bank of Japan met Jacob Schiff, an American banker and head of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Schiff, in response to Russia's anti-Jewish pogroms and sympathetic to Japan's cause, extended a critical series of loans to the Empire of Japan, in the amount of 200 million US dollars .

The size of Esen's army is unknown but a best guess puts it at some 20,000 men. The Ming army of about 500,000 was hastily assembled; its command was made up of 20 experienced generals and a large entourage of high-ranking civil officials, with Wang Zhen acting as field marshal. On August 3 Esen's army crushed a badly supplied Chinese army at Yanghe, just inside the Great Wall. The same day the Emperor appointed his half-brother Zhu Qiyu as regent. The next day he left Beijing for Juyong Pass.

However, the main thrust of his attack was at Kanchanaburi. His 20,000-strong main southern army invaded via the Myitta Pass.  Kanchanaburi fell with little resistance. The main reason for the quick fall of Kanchanaburi could be that the Burmese were more battle-hardened. But it could also be that the Siamese command miscalculated where the Burmese main attack would come from, and had not sufficiently reinforced the fort to withstand a major attack. Judging by the Siamese chronicles' reporting of the main attack route, the Siamese command appeared to have believed that the main Burmese attack would come from the Gulf of Siam coastline, instead of the most obvious and shortest route via Kanchanaburi. The Siamese sources say that Maha Nawrahta's main invasion route came from southern Tenasserim, crossing the Tenasserim range at Chumphon and Phetburi.

However, Patriots' return specialist Chris Harper muffed the punt, which was recovered by Shaquil Barrett at the Patriots' 36-yard line, giving the Broncos new life. Four plays later, the Broncos pulled to within a one-touchdown deficit, with a 15-yard touchdown run by running back C. J. Anderson.

On the first third down of the drive, Aaron Rodgers completed his first pass of the day to TE Donald Lee for an 11-yard gain. Colts CB Marlin Jackson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after the play and the Colts were penalized 15&#160;yards for the Packers 49 down to the Colts 36-yard line. After a 1-yard run and an incomplete pass on 1st and second downs, Rodgers completed a 6-yard pass to TE Donald Lee on 3rd and 9 but was nullified when Colts CB Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive holding on WR Greg Jennings during the play resulting in a 5-yard penalty and a 1st down. The next play was a run by RB Ryan Grant for 4&#160;yards. Grant fumbled the ball on the play and it looked to be recovered by the Colts, but the ball slipped past the defenders and FB Korey Hall dove onto the ball and recovered the fumble for the Packers. Grant then followed up the play with a 5-yard gain on 2nd down and a surprise hand off to FB John Kuhn on 3rd down and 1 for 3&#160;yards secured another 1st down for the Packers at the Colts 18-yard line. The drive ended with an incomplete pass the WR Ruvell Martin on 3rd down and the Packers were forced to settle for a Mason Crosby 31-yard field goal to take the early 3-0 lead. After the field goal, The Packers attempted to onside kick but the ball went out of bounds after 15&#160;yards. On the retry, Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds again but this time it was much farther down field. The ball was then placed at the Colts 45-yard line but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved the ball back to the Colts 30-yard line. On the Colts first drive, they seemed to be able to move the ball very well with runs by the injured starter  Joseph Addai's replacement Dominic Rhodes paired with a 9-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on CB Tramon Williams on 3rd and 1 at the Colts 39, QB Peyton Manning connected with WR Reggie Wayne for a 15-yard gain on the next 3rd down to the GB 16-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed the ball four consecutive times and capped the drive with a 3-yard rush for the touchdown. The Colts took the 7-3 lead with 4:06 left in the 1st. The Packers second drive of the game started with an Aaron Rodgers pass left to Greg Jennings for 14&#160;yards under soft coverage. Ryan Grant continued rushing the ball better with a nice 7-yard gain on the next play to the Green Bay 41-yard line. Rodgers failed to connect on a pass deep to Greg Jennings on the next play but CB Tim Jennings was flagged for pass interference resulting in a 25-yard penalty down to the Colts 34-yard line. After a couple of short runs by Ryan Grant, Rodgers completed a 7-yard pass to Greg Jennings on 3rd and 6 for the first down. After a Colts neutral zone infraction penalty and a couple more short rush attempts by Ryan Grant, The Packers first touchdown of the game was scored on a 12-yard pass to TE Donald Lee. With a little more than 14&#160;minutes left in the 2nd quarter, the Packers took the 10-7 lead. The Colts continued to attempt to move the ball on their next drive with runs and short passes to the running backs and tight ends but their drive stalled near midfield when Peyton Manning completed a pass to WR Marvin Harrison a-yard short of the first down. It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach Tony Dungy thought otherwise and Peyton Manning left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision. After the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR Donald Driver to the 35-yard line. After a short 3-yard gain by Ryan Grant and two 3-yard receptions by Donald Driver, the Packers were faced with a 4 and 1 at their own 44-yard line much like the Colts on their previous drive. Instead of punting like the Colts did, the Packers kept their offense on the field a managed to get the first down on a nice 7-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 33-yard line with a few short runs by Ryan Grant mixed with a short pass to RB Brandon Jackson for 9&#160;yards. On 2nd a 7 Rodgers dropped back to pass and looked to throw to WR Greg Jennings but decided to dump the ball off the Brandon Jackson for the second time on the drive but he was tackled for a 1-yard loss. During the play a flag was thrown for illegal use of the hands on CB Tim Jennings who was coving Greg Jennings on the play. After a rush for no gain on 1st down at the Colts 28, Rodgers connected with WR Ruvell Martin for 17&#160;yards to the Colts 11-yard line. The Packers scored their second touchdown of the day on the next play with an 11-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers now held a 17-7 lead with 2:53 left in the half. Now in a ten-point hole, The Colts offense took the field again but could not manage to get a first down. DT Ryan Pickett batted down the pass intended for Marvin Harrison on 3rd down and forced the Colts to punt. With 1:54 remaining in the half the Packers started their final drive of the half on their own 33-yard line. The drive featured many short passes to RB Brandon Jackson for decent gains along with a Rodgers scramble down the middle of the field for a 9-yard gain. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 18-yard line and took a time out with 9&#160;seconds left. Mason Crosby attempted a 36-yard field goal but the kick was pushed wide left. The half ended with Peyton Manning taking a knee and the Packers went in the half with a 17-7 lead. The Colts started the second half with possession and managed to move the ball to the Packers 48-yard line, but a pass to Reggie Wayne on 3rd and 6 went through his hands and popped up into the air. FS Nick Collins who was a couple yards behind Wayne was in perfect position to intercept the ball and returned it 62&#160;yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24-7 lead early in the 3rd. After the interception return the Colts offense took the field and managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28-yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's Adam Vinatieri attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT Johnny Jolly. The Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&#160;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by Ryan Grant. The highlight of the drive took place when FB Korey Hall received a pass from Aaron Rodgers and hurdled over the oncoming defender. The drive ended when Ryan Grant couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by Mason Crosby to extend the lead to 27-7. The Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by Peyton Manning. The Colts punted and the Packers ended the 3rd quarter with 2 rushes by Ryan Grant. The first play of the 4th was an incomplete pass to TE Tory Humphrey and the Packers were forced to punt for the first time of the contest. The Colts again couldn't move the ball on their next possession and were forced to punt, The Packers took over and gain one first down on a pass to Brandon Jackson, but they failed to break into Colts territory and punted for the second time of the contest. With time not on the Colts side, the Colts drove down all the way to the Packers 5-yard line and were looking to score. Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to Dallas Clark earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by Charles Woodson but S Aaron Rouse batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR Anthony Gonzalez at the 1-yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&#160;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34-7 with about 4:30 remaining in the game. In a prevent style defense, the Packers allowed the Colts offense to move down the field to the Green Bay 15. Peyton Manning threw the ball to Anthony Gonzalez at the goal line and he looked to be in for the score. The booth reviewed the catch and the call on the field was reversed. On the next play, Manning completed another pass to Dallas Clark and he dove for the pylon for the score. The booth reviewed the touchdown and again the touchdown wasn't awarded but the ball was placed at the 1-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed 1-yard for the touchdown to decrease the Packers lead to 34-14. The Colts lined up in an onside kick formation but kicker Adam Vinatieri instead kicked the ball shallow and it was easily caught by Charles Woodson. Ryan Grant rushed for 9&#160;yards on 1st down to put him over the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and two Aaron Rodgers kneel downs sealed the dominating victory.

The British heard about this revolt in Manila and even asked the help of Silang in fighting the Spanish. However, Silang was killed on May 28, 1763 by Miguel Vicos, a friend of Silang. The Spanish authorities paid for his murder, leading to his death in the arms of his wife, Gabriela. She continued her husband's struggle, earning the title \"Joan of Arc of the Ilocos\" because of her many victories in battle. The battles of the Silang revolt are a prime example of the use of divide et impera, since Spanish troops largely used Kapampangan soldiers to fight the Ilocanos. Eventually, the revolt ended with the defeat of the Ilocanos. Gabriela Silang was executed by Spanish authorities in Vigan on September 10, 1763.\nQuestion: How many years were between the beginning of the Silang Revolt and when Diego Silang declared the independence of llocandia?",

In the second quarter, Tampa Bay finally scored its first touchdown of the season on a short pass from Simms to Joey Galloway, then followed that up in the third quarter with Carnell Williams scoring his first TD run of the season. Later that quarter, Simms led a drive that was wrapped up by a 2-yard bootleg by Simms on a fake to Mike Alstott, but Simms was hit hard on the play, and had to leave the game momentarily to let rookie Bruce Gradkowski take over. Simms returned in the fourth quarter to lead another scoring drive which ended with a long field goal by Matt Bryant. Unfortunately for the Bucs, the Panthers' kicker John Kasay hit his fourth field goal of the day, winning the game for the Panthers with only six seconds to spare. After the game, it was learned that Simms had a ruptured spleen and went into emergency surgery to remove it.

The Amami Islands paid tribute to the Ryukyu Kingdom to the South until they were put under direct control in the late 16th century, but were conquered in 1609 by the Satsuma Domain.

The Tokara Islands and the north-western group of the Ōsumi Islands were transferred to Ōshima District in 1897, and then to Kagoshima District in 1973. After World War II, the Tokara and Amami Islands were put under United States military occupation, which formed the Government of the Northern Ryukyus. The Japanese government fiercely contested the Amami Islands being affiliated with the word \"Ryukyu\", believing that it would lead to a later return of the islands to their control.

The first Jewish communities appeared in Franconia in the 12th and 13th centuries and thus later than, for example, in Regensburg. In the Middle Ages, Franconia was a stronghold of Torah studies. But Franconia also began to exclude the Jewish populations particularly early on. For example, there were two Jewish massacres - the Rintfleisch massacres of 1298 and the Armleder Uprising of 1336-1338 - and in the 15th and 16th centuries many cities exiled their Jewish populations, which is why many Jews settled in rural communities. Franconia also rose to early prominence in the discrimination of Jews during the Nazi era. One of the first casualties of the organized Nazi persecution of Jews took place on 21 March in Künzelsau and on 25/26 March 1933 in Creglingen, where police and SA troops under the leadership of Standartenführer Fritz Klein led a so-called \"weapons search operations\".Whilst, in 1818, about 65 per cent of Bavarian Jews lived in the Bavarian part of Franconia, today there are only Jewish communities in Bamberg, Bayreuth, Erlangen, Fürth, Hof, Nuremberg and Würzburg and in Heilbronn in Baden-Württemberg.\nQuestion: Which massacres happened first, the Rintfleisch massacres or the Armleder Uprising?",

Despite the desegregation of the U.S. armed forces in 1948 by Executive Order 9981, the 24th Infantry remained predominantly African-American, with an officer corps of both African and European Americans. In late June 1950, soon after North Korea invaded South Korea, the 24th deployed to Korea to assist in the Korean War. The 24th Infantry fought throughout the entire Korean peninsula, from the defense of the \"Pusan Perimeter\" to its breakout and the pursuit of communist forces well into North Korea, to the Chinese counteroffensives, and finally to U.N. counteroffensives that stabilized near the current Demilitarized Zone. The regiment received the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for its defense of the Pusan Perimeter. The regiment also had two posthumous Medal of Honor recipients, Cornelius H. Charlton and William Thompson. The cases of Lieutenant Leon Gilbert, court martialed for refusing an order from the 24th's commanding officer , and of some other members of the 24th, helped bring greater attention to problems of segregation and discrimination within the U.S. military. The landing at Inchon by U.S. and ROK forces on 15 September finally compelled the North Koreans to withdraw from the Pusan Perimeter.

In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, expelling the English and Huguenot forces from much of the area.

However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of Brest as a launching point for an invasion of England by capturing Fort Crozon. The French civil war turned increasingly against the hardliners of the French Catholic League. With the signing of the Triple Alliance in 1596 between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took Calais. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry retook Amiens, just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose  ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne.

Griffin started his career as well as possible, going 6/6 on his opening possession, setting up a 37-yard field goal by new Redskins kicker Billy Cundiff. However, the lead would be short lived as Six-time Pro Bowl QB Drew Brees marched his Saints down the field, culminating in a 20-yard touchdown pass to star tight end Jimmy Graham. For the first time, Griffin's resolve was tested, as he marched onto the field trailing for the first time. Griffin was unfazed, and after not completing a pass ahead of the line of scrimmage on his first possession, Griffin connected with fellow new Redskins Pierre Gar&#231;on for an 88-yard strike to give Washington a 10-7 lead. In the second quarter, Washington's lead continued to grow, as Griffin found second-year man Aldrick Robinson for a 5-yard touchdown pass to extend Washington's advantage to 17-7. Cundiff added a 41-yard field goal to give Washington a 20-7 advantage. On the next Saints ensuing possession, Brees found Marques Colston who was on his way to an apparent touchdown, but fumbled in the Washington endzone, which resulted in a touchback. Appearing to go into the second half up 20-7, Saverio Rocca's punt was blocked and returned four yards for a touchdown by Saints special teamer Courtney Roby to make it 20-14 at the half. Getting the ball to start the second half, Washington extended its advantage by way of a 1-yard rush TD by rookie running back Alfred Morris. Washington would again expand upon its lead via Cundiff's 37-yarder, to make it 30-14 Washington. Saints kicker Garrett Hartley hit a 21-yard field goal to close the third quarter scoring at 30-17. In the fourth, Washington again pushed its advantage to 16 when Billy Cundiff nailed his fourth field goal of the day, this one from 45 yards. However, the Saints would not go quietly. On the Saints' ensuing possession, Brian Orakpo dropped an interception on 3rd and 10 that would've all but sealed the deal. With this new break, Brees made the Redskins pay, as Lance Moore beat Madieu Williams to the endzone for a 33-yard touchdown on 4th-and-10. Darren Sproles scored on the two-point conversion to cut the Redskins lead to 33-25. The Redskins could not amass a first down on their next drive, and Drew Brees got the ball back with the crowd sensing a comeback. However, Brees overthrew his intended receiver on the first play of the drive, and DeJon Gomes returned the interception to the Saints 3-yard line, and on the next play, Alfred Morris extended the advantage to 40-25. However, the Saints continued to battle. It took Brees less than one minute to march New Orleans down the field and find Darren Sproles for a 2-yard touchdown pass, and the Saints again pulled within 8. The Redskins got the ball back and were able to nearly run out the clock, but gave Brees one last chance. However, fortunately for the Redskins, Brees' Hail Mary pass on the final play of the game fell short of the intended target and was intercepted by Reed Doughty to preserve the 40-32 upset win.

In 1681 he instituted the policy of dragonnades, to intimidate Huguenot families to convert to Roman Catholicism or emigrate. Finally, in October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which formally revoked the Edict and made the practice of Protestantism illegal in France. The revocation of the Edict had very damaging results for France. While it did not prompt renewed religious warfare, many Protestants chose to leave France rather than convert, with most moving to Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic and Switzerland. At the dawn of the 18th century, Protestants remained in significant numbers in the remote Cévennes region of the Massif Central. This population, known as the Camisards, revolted against the government in 1702, leading to fighting that continued intermittently until 1715, after which the Camisards were largely left in peace.\nQuestion: WHAT DID LOUIS XIII IN 1681 DO TO INTIMIDATE THE HUGUENOTS TO CONVERT TO ROMAN CATHOLICISM",

Nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson with mining interests in the Bergslagen area stood out as the rebel leader, commanding a peasant army.

However, as before, people felt these promises were not being fulfilled, hence the rebels picked up their axes once more. On April 27, 1436, a rebel army unit was sent marching towards Stockholm, where people still supported Eric due to the strong and influential Danish presence in the city. A certain degree of inner tension among the rebelling forces occurred because the Nobility and Clergy decided to support Karl Knutsson Bonde, who in 1436 had risen to the position of Rikshövitsman.

In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland, led by Wilhelm VII, Duke of Jülich, who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia. This army broke the Siege of Königsberg but as soon as the army returned home, the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians. Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated, leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed. Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory , and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga, Elbing, Culm, Thorn, and Königsberg. Most castles fell in 1262-1263, and Bartenstein fell in 1264. The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence, so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not have to stay near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia, raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia. A recovered Herkus Monte raided Culmerland with a large force and took many prisoners in 1263. On his way back to Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm  in 1263 and in 1265.\nQuestion: How many years pass between the defeat of the Teutons and the arrival of reinforcements?",

The normal death rate tripled in January and February 1740, and burials averaged out about 50% higher during the twenty-one-month crisis than for the years 1737-1739, according to Dickson.

Based on contemporary accounts and burial parish records, famine-related deaths may have totaled 300,000-480,000 in Ireland, with rates highest in the south and east of the country. This was a proportionately greater toll than during the most severe years of the Great Famine .  That famine, however, was unique in \"cause, scale and timing,\" persisting over several years.

African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded. The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax. In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all \"unreasonable\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures.

The Mongols demanded tribute, in 1271 and again in 1273. When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287. The Mongols once again invaded south toward Pagan. Recent research indicates that Mongol armies may not have reached Pagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. But the damage was already done. All the vassal states of Pagan revolted right after the king's death, and went their own way. In the south, Wareru, the man who had seized the governorship of Martaban in 1281, consolidated Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma, and declared Ramannadesa  independent.

The Raiders needed a win and a Miami Dolphins loss or a win and a Denver Broncos loss to clinch a playoff berth. Oakland started well, recovering a muffed fumble by Tyreek Hill on a punt following their first drive and setting them up at the Kansas City 38-yard line. However, the Raiders had to settle for a field goal by Sebastian Janikowsi to take the early 3-0 lead. It would be the last lead the Raiders enjoyed on the night. Oakland's offense could muster little for most of the first half including after the Raider defense stopped KC on a fourth and one at the Oakland 27. The Chiefs took the lead early in the second quarter on a 36-yard pass from Alex Smith to Hill to make the score 7-3. After a four-and-out possession for the Raiders, the Chiefs again went down the field scoring on a Charcandrick West three-yard touchdown run. Following another Raiders short offensive possession, Hill returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown to extend the Chief lead to 21-3. With six minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders went up-tempo and moved the ball down the field capping the drive with a one-yard touchdown run by Latavius Murray with 14 seconds remaining. At the half, the Raiders trailed 21-10. To begin the second half, the Raider defense stepped up intercepting Smith on the second play of the half and giving the offense the ball at the KC 23. However, the offense was shut down by the KC defense and settled for another Janikowski field goal, bringing them within a touchdown of the Chiefs at 21-13. On the next offensive play for the Chiefs, Khalil Mack sacked and stripped Smith of the ball and the Raiders recovered at the KC 18-yard line. The offense again managed little and was forced to settle for a field goal attempt. However, a bad snap resulted in Marquette King being tackled for three-yard loss. Both offenses mustered very little for the remainder of the game. With seven minutes left in the game, the Raiders needed a touchdown to tie and moved down to the KC 19-yard line, but were stopped on fourth down and the Chiefs ran the clock out. Derek Carr struggled mightily with his accuracy on the night, only completing 17 of his 41 pass attempts for 117 yards. He often missed open receivers or badly threw behind receivers. Carr admitted he had a bad night saying, \"Obviously, we didn't do enough.\" The loss ended the Raiders six-game win streak and gave the Chiefs the lead in the division with a 2-0 record over the Raiders.

General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over Finland, and about his planned attack on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks and capture Russian Karelia. The Germans opposed these plans due to their peace treaties with Lenin. The Civil War weakened the Finnish Parliament; it became a Rump Parliament that included only three socialist representatives. On 9 October 1918, under pressure from Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, Friedrich Karl, the brother-in-law of German Emperor William II, to become the King of Finland. The German leadership was able to utilise the breakdown of Russia for the geopolitical benefit of the German Empire in Fennoscandia also. The Civil War and the aftermath diminished independence of Finland, compared to the status it had held at the turn of the year 1917-1918. The economic condition of Finland deteriorated drastically from 1918; recovery to pre-conflict levels was achieved only in 1925. The most acute crisis was in food supply, already deficient in 1917, though large-scale starvation had been avoided that year. The Civil War caused marked starvation in southern Finland. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium. Hoover arranged for the delivery of food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, and to allow food into the country.\nQuestion: How many years did it take the Finnish economy to recover after its 1918 decline?",

On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions. (Stanley Morgan, 534) This would be the last time Brady lost at home to a team from another AFC division during the regular season until Week 1 of the 2017 season.\nQuestion: Which team scored first?",
