According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents, starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers, but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani , which was an aggressive pro-Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands. According to British reports on political crimes , during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed , excluding those killed during the Ilinden uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands. Of those who were killed, 53% were Bulgarians, 33.5% were Greeks, Serbs and Aromanians together 3.5% and 10% were of an unknown nationality. These conflicts ended after the revolution of Young Turks in July 1908, as they promised to respect all ethnicities and religions, and to provide a constitution.\nQuestion: How many in percent were killed that weren't Bulgarians?",

The game did not start well for the Colts who allowed the Eagles to score a quick touchdown on only 3 plays covering 72&#160;yards.  A Peyton Manning interception caused more concern as the Colts now found themselves under the gun halfway through the first quarter.  Two key defensive stops allowed the Eagles to only score two field goals making it a 13-0 Eagles lead heading into the second quarter.  A touchdown pass from Manning to Jacob Tamme allowed the Colts to get back into the game trailing the Eagles only 13-7.  A Philadelphia field goal from David Akers added to the lead, however the Colts continued chipping away.  A hard hit on wide receiver Austin Collie, who was returning from injury that week, caused a 10&#8209;minute delay in the game in which he was strapped to a stripper and taken to a nearby hospital, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  The Colts, playing with passion, drove down the field and scored a touchdown and field goal within the final two minutes of the half, giving them a 17-16 lead at halftime.  The offensive production seen by the Colts in the second quarter was nowhere to be found in the third.  The Colts began the third quarter with two three-and-outs while the Eagles got the lead back with a 44-yard field goal halfway through the quarter.

A continued lack of offensive production gave the Eagles the ball back and time to milk the clock.  The Colts received the ball back with less than four minutes remaining in the game, trailing by two scores and drove down to score a touchdown.  Jim Caldwell elected to kick the ball away to Philadelphia with 1:50 left, a first down and a defensive stop gave the Colts the ball back with less than 0:50&#160;seconds in the game.

The Lions took a first-quarter lead by blocking a Robbie Gould field-goal attempt, and then using the field position to score a field goal. The Bears' offense struggled to move the ball in the first quarter, and but began to pick up momentum in the second quarter. Griese threw a fifteen-yard touchdown to Muhsin Muhammad, but also threw two interceptions in two red zone visits. Jon Kitna and the Lions' top-tier passing offense exploited the Bears' injury-depleted secondary. He threw two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, to keep the Bears four points behind the Lions. Griese threw an interception to Keith Smith, who returned it for a touchdown. However, Devin Hester responded by returning the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. The Lions established their running game later, and allowed Kevin Jones to score a rushing touchdown, sending the Lions up by ten again. Griese led the Bears downfield on the subsequent drive. After several unusual penalties and mishaps, the Griese threw a touchdown to Desmond Clark. Now trailing by three points, Gould attempted by an onside kick, but it was recovered and returned by Casey FitzSimmons, sealing the Bears' loss.

For the fourth straight home game the Patriots played the Jets in a contest where the final margin of victory was less than ten points, and third straight where the margin didn't exceed three points. Tom Brady made his 200th career regular season start. On the fourth play of the game, Shane Vereen went completely unnoticed by the Jets' secondary, on a wheel route,  and Brady hit him for a 49-yard touchdown, just 1:29 into the game. Following this, the Jets drove all the ways to the Patriots 9. On 1st-and-goal, Geno Smith hit Jeremy Kerley for a touchdown, but the play was nullified when offensive guard Oday Aboushi was flagged for holding. The Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone over the next three plays and the Jets settled for a 22-yard field goal from Nick Folk. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets seemed primed for a touchdown, but another critical holding call moved the Jets out of the red zone, and Folk kicked a 47-yard field goal, making the score 7-6. The Patriots went three-and-out yet again, but once more the Jets could only get a Folk field goal, this one from 46 yards, but the Jets took their first lead, 9-7. This time the Patriots responded this time, racing 80 yards in 10 plays to take the lead on Brady's 3-yard touchdown pass to Vereen, this one for 3 yards, to take the lead. The Jets reached the Patriots 9 for the second time, but the Patriots defense once again turned into a brick wall in the red zone, and Folk had to kick his fourth field goal of the half to bring the score to 14-12. A crucial pass-interference penalty on Asher Allen on the Patriots' next drive, helped them reach Jets' territory and Gostkowski kicked a 39-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-12 lead at halftime.  On the Jets first drive of the third quarter they continued their clock-draining strategy with an 11-play, 6:02 drive, this time reaching the end zone again with Chris Ivory scoring on a 1-yard touchdown plunge, giving the Jets their second lead of the game, 19-17. Once again though, the Patriots countered, moving 53 yards to the Jets 18, and Gostkowski banged in a 36-yard field goal, taking a 20-19 lead. The next five combined possessions ended in punts. With 10:51 remaining in the game, Tom Brady engineered a Brady-esque drive reaching the Jets 4. A 6-yard false start penalty on Wright and a 10-yard offensive pass interference penalty on LaFell sent them back to the Jets 19. Following an in-completion to Vereen, on 3rd-and-Goal, Brady rolled out to the left and found Danny Amendola for the touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 27-19. This was Amendola's only catch of the game. The Jets didn't give up though. Geno Smith engineered a 12-play, 86-yard drive, finding tight end Jeff Cumberland for a 10-yard TD pass to cut the Patriots' lead to two points with 2:31 remaining. However, the 2-point conversion failed and the Jets still trailed, 27-25. Amendola recovered the onside kick, but the Jets defense stepped up, preventing the Patriots from running out the clock, giving the Jets one last chance at an upset with 1:06 remaining. Starting at their own 31, Geno Smith hit David Nelson for 11 yards to the Jets 42. Next, completing a pass to Jeremy Kerley for 13 to the Patriots 45. Chris Ivory ran for five yards before heading out of bounds at the Patriots 40. After an incomplete pass, Folk came on to attempt the game-winning 58-yard field with 0:05 seconds left, but the kick was blocked by defensive lineman Chris Jones, who had been called for a personal foul on a field goal attempt against the Jets the previous season which led to Folk's game winning 42-yard field goal, and the Patriots escaped with their third win in a row. Though not spectacular, Brady was efficient, completing  20 of 37 passes for 261 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. Geno Smith completed 20 of 34 passes for 226 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions. Vereen was the top rusher & receiver for the Patriots with 43 yards rushing and 71 receiving.

Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377; he was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son Richard II , who was still a child. The treaty at Brétigny left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France; however, a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and, by the time of Charles V's death in 1380, the English only held Calais and a few other coastal cities. It was usual to appoint a regent in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377. However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, although Gaunt remained highly influential. Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384-1385.

A rumour spread that Princess Joanna was not actually the daughter of King Henry but rather of Beltrán de la Cueva, the alleged lover of Queen Joan of Portugal. Joanna was thus nicknamed \"la Beltraneja\", as a mocking reference to her assumed father. Pressure from members of the nobility forced the King to strip her of the title and name his half-brother Alfonso as heir, in 1464. In 1465, a group of nobility assembled in Ávila and overthrew King Henry, replacing him with Alfonso. That led to a war that ended in 1468 with the death of the 14-year-old Alfonso. Henry IV regained the throne, but the title of heir became disputed between Joanna, his daughter, and Isabella, his half-sister. That was resolved via the Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando, which gave Isabella succession rights but restricted her marriage options. Isabella secretly married Ferdinand in 1469 at the age of 17, ignoring Henry IV's wishes. Gradually, the couple gained a larger number of supporters and obtained a papal bull sanctioning their marriage from Pope Sixtus IV in 1472 and gained the support of the powerful Mendoza family in 1473. When Henry IV died in December 1474, both candidates for the throne were proclaimed Queen of Castile by their respective supporters.

Thomas Hoye Jr. is the current mayor of Taunton, and has held the position since 2012. Founded in 1637 by members of the Plymouth Colony, Taunton is one of the oldest towns in the United States. The Native Americans called the region Cohannet, Tetiquet and Titicut before the arrival of the Europeans. Taunton is also known as the \"Silver City\", as it was a historic center of the silver industry beginning in the 19th century when companies such as Reed & Barton, F. B. Rogers, Poole Silver, and others produced fine-quality silver goods in the city. Since December 1914, the city of Taunton has provided a large annual light display each December on Taunton Green, giving it the additional nickname of \"Christmas City\". The original boundaries of Taunton included the land now occupied by many surrounding towns, including Norton, Easton, Mansfield, Dighton, Raynham, Berkley, and Lakeville. Possession of the latter is still noted by the naming of Taunton Hill in Assonet.\nQuestion: Thomas Hoye Jr was elected mayor how many years after Taunton was founded?",

His date of birth, like his mother's name, is unknown. Contemporary works such as the Chronicon and the Encomium Emmae, do not mention this. Even so, in a Knútsdrápa by the skald Óttarr svarti, there is a statement that Cnut was \"of no great age\" when he first went to war.

If Cnut indeed accompanied this expedition, his birthdate may be near 990, or even 980. If not, and if the skald's poetic verse references another assault, such as Forkbeard's conquest of England in 1013/14, it may even suggest a birth date nearer 1000.

Washington had reason to be nervous, as they were 1-6 all-time on Thanksgiving, and 0-6 against Dallas. In the first, Washington got the ball first, but went three-and-out. After a Sav Rocca punt, Dallas had decent field position, and quickly reached the red zone. However, Washington's defense then stiffened, and held Dallas to a Dan Bailey 30-yard field goal. The teams then exchanged punts, and the first quarter concluded without any further scoring. In the second, Washington had the ball inside their own 35, and quarterback Robert Griffin III used a play-action pass, and found a streaking Aldrick Robinson for a 68-yard strike, and Washington took its first lead of the game, at 7-3. On Dallas' ensuing possession, Dallas moved the ball into Washington territory, but after Tony Romo completed an 11-yard pass to Dez Bryant that had Dallas in Washington territory, Redskins cornerback Josh Wilson hit him, and dislodged the football, which was subsequently recovered by safety DeJon Gomes into Dallas territory. Washington would capitalize, with their drive culminating in an Alfred Morris 1-yard touchdown run to extend Washington's advantage to 14-3. Dallas would then punt after just three plays, and Washington marched near midfield, before Griffin connected with wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on across the middle, and Garcon proceeded to streak to the endzone for a 59-yard score, and Washington led 21-3 with just over 2 minutes remaining in the half. Dallas would attempt to run a two-minute drill, but Romo's pass, intended for Cole Beasley was intercepted by DeAngelo Hall and returned inside the Dallas 25. With mere seconds remaining in the half, Griffin found Santana Moss in the corner of the endzone for a score, and a 28-3 halftime lead. In the third, Dallas marched down the field on their opening possession, but the drive stalled again, and Dallas settled for another Bailey field goal, this time from 33 yards out. The majority of the rest of the quarter proved to be a defensive struggle, as Romo was intercepted again, this time by London Fletcher, but Washington could not capitalize on it. After a Rocca punt, Dallas was pinned inside their 20, but Romo connected with a wide-open Dez Bryant, who streaked 85 yards to the end zone, and before you could blink, Dallas was back in the game, at 28-13 Washington. Going into the fourth, Washington was driving, in an attempt to extend their lead back to three scores. They would succeed in this endeavor, as Griffin found tight end Niles Paul for a 30-yard touchdown on third-and-inches, and Washington took a 35-13 lead with just under 13 minutes to go. Dallas, however, would not give up, as expected. To save time, Dallas ran a no-huddle offense, and was able to march down the field, and find Felix Jones for a 10-yard touchdown, and a subsequent quarterback draw by Romo cut the lead to 35-21 with just under 10 minutes remaining. On Washington's next possession, disaster struck. Robert Griffin III lofted a throw over the middle that he overthrew horribly, and it was easily intercepted by Charlie Peprah and returned inside the Washington 20. However, Washington's defense put Dallas into a 4th down situation, but Romo found Dez Bryant in the left corner of the end zone, and with over 8 minutes remaining, Dallas was now within a touchdown, as Washington's lead was merely 35-28. With his mettle about to be tested, Robert Griffin III led an efficient, clock-chewing drive that concluded with a Kai Forbath 48-yard field goal to extend Washington's advantage to 38-28 with just under three minutes remaining. Dallas, needing a touchdown, onside kick recovery, and field goal to send it to overtime, again marched into Washington territory, but couldn't get to the endzone, as Dez Bryant caught a pass in the endzone that was dislodged at the last minute by Madieu Williams, and Dallas had to settle for a 51-yard field goal by Bailey. This cut the score to 38-31, and Dallas lined up for an onside kick, needing a touchdown to tie the game, with 18 seconds remaining. However, it was recovered by DeAngelo Hall and returned to the Dallas 2, as Hall opted not to score, instead letting Robert Griffin III kneel-down to seal the deal. Griffin went 20-for-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception, becoming the first rookie QB in NFL history to throw 4 passing touchdowns in back-to-back games. With the win, Washington improved to 5-6, 2-1 in the NFC East, and into second place in the NFC East by virtue of the tiebreaker over Dallas. Washington also won its first Thanksgiving game since the 1973 season, when they defeated the Detroit Lions.

Seth Roberts caught a two-yard pass from Derek Carr to put the Raiders up 7-0. The Panthers answered on a three-yard touchdown run by Cam Newton to tie the score. The rest of the first half belonged to the Raiders as Latavius Murray scored from four yards out and Sebastian Janikowski kicked a 23-yard field goal to put the Raiders up 17-7. The Panther took over with 1:56 remaining in the second quarter looking to cut the Raider lead, but Khalil Mack made an acrobatic catch of Newton pass and returned it six yards for another Raider touchdown. The Panthers took a knee on the final possession of the half as the Raiders held a 24-7 lead. On the second play of the third quarter, Carr injured the pinky finger of his throwing hand on an awkward snap. The play resulted in a fumble recovered by the Panthers. Six plays later, Jonathan Stewart scored from one-yard out to cut the lead to 24-13 after the extra point was blocked. With Carr in the locker room tending to his injured finger, Matt McGloin took over for the Raiders, but they could not muster any offense and were forced to punt. Newton then hit Ted Ginn Jr. on an 88-yard pass and catch to put the Panthers with five. The Panthers opted to go for two points, but failed and, therefore, trailed 24-19. Carr returned to the game with a glove on this throwing hand on the next possession, but after completing two passes, Carr was intercepted by Thomas Davis. The Panthers continued their hot start to the half as Stewart scored his second rushing touchdown of the game. The Panthers again failed on their two-point conversion, but now held the lead, 25-24. Following three straight incompletions by Carr, the Panters took over and extended the lead on a 44-yard pass from Newton to Kelvin Benjamin. Now trailing 32-24, the Raiders answered on a 10-play drive capped off by a Clive Walford 12-yard touchdown reception. The two point conversion was good on a Carr pass to Roberts and the game was tied at 32. The Raiders defense forced a punt by the Panthers and the Raiders took over with 5:05 remaining in the game. The Raiders 12-play drive stalled at the Carolina six-yard line, but Janikowski hit his second field goal of the game to give the Raiders a 35-32 lead.

The first fighting was at Rahum.  The movement was encouraged by Pedro Leyva, a Catholic priest and took the Virgin of Guadalupe as its symbol. The Yaqui coalesced around Juan Banderas as their leader.  Banderas managed to get the Mayos, Opatas and Pimas to join in the war against the Mexican government.  Occidente was so affected by the war that the capital was moved from Cosala to Fuerte. In 1827 Banderas' forces were defeated by Mexicans in the vicinity of Hermosillo.  This defeat was partly due to the Yaquis having primarily bows and arrows, while the Mexicans had guns.  After this defeat, Banderas negotiated a peace with Occidente, in which he was granted pardon, and recognized as captain-general of the Yaqui town, and was given a salary. In 1828 the office of captain-general was abolished, and Occidente government reasserted its right to tax the Yaqui, as well as proposing a plan for allotting the Yaqui lands.

Broncos' defensive tackle Sylvester Williams blocked a 38-yard field goal attempt by Raiders' placekicker Sebastian Janikowski late in the first quarter. The Broncos then marched down to as far as the Raiders' 8-yard line, but had to settle for a 25-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus early in the second quarter. The Raiders then took a 7-3 lead, with fullback Marcel Reece receiving a 3-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Derek Carr. The Broncos were attempting to take the lead just before halftime, however, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Raiders' safety Charles Woodson in the end zone. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on the initial possession of the second half, and on the Raiders' first play from scrimmage, Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a strip sack and fumble recovery of Carr deep in Raiders' territory. The Broncos had to settle for a 20-yard field goal by McManus to pull to within 7-6. Following a Raiders' three-and-out, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with a 52-yard field goal by McManus. Following another Woodson interception of Manning, the Raiders were attempting to take the lead on the first play of the fourth quarter, however, Janikowski missed wide-left on a 40-yard field goal attempt. Trailing 9-7, the Raiders were once again attempting to take lead, until Broncos' cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. stepped in front of an errant Carr pass and returned an interception 74 yards for a touchdown. With 6:14 remaining in the game, the Raiders were in punt formation with a 4th-and-6 at their own 24-yard line. However, a 5-yard neutral zone penalty on Broncos' safety Omar Bolden gave the Raiders a 4th-and-1, and after a successful fourth-down conversion, the Raiders kept the drive alive. With 2:38 remaining in the game, the Broncos' defense denied a 4th-and-long pass completion from Carr to Reece near midfield. However, the Broncos were unable to earn a game-clinching first down just before the two-minute warning, which forced the Raiders to burn two of their three team timeouts. On the very next play, a defensive pass interference penalty on Broncos' cornerback Bradley Roby while defending a pass from Carr to wide receiver Amari Cooper moved the football to the Broncos' 32-yard line. With only one timeout remaining, the Raiders decided to send Janikowski onto the field for a 50-yard field goal to pull the Raiders to within 16-10 with 1:45 remaining in the game. The Raiders' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, and were forced to use their last timeout on the Broncos' first play from scrimmage. Running back C. J. Anderson gained only two yards on three running plays. With eight seconds remaining, Cooper received a punt near the goal line, but the Broncos' defensive special teams subdued the Raiders' last desperation play of the game.

Henry, Francis, and Charles attempted extensive diplomatic maneuvering to break the deadlock; but none of the three trusted the others, and this had little practical effect. In January 1546, Henry sent the Earl of Hertford to Calais, apparently preparing for an offensive; but one failed to materialize. Francis could not afford to resume a large-scale war, and Henry was concerned only for the disposition of Boulogne. Negotiations between the two resumed on 6 May. On 7 June 1546, the Treaty of Ardres—also known as the Treaty of Camp—was signed by Claude d'Annebault, Pierre Ramon, and Guillaume Bochetel on behalf of Francis, and Viscount Lisle, Baron Paget and Nicholas Wotton on behalf of Henry. By its terms, Henry would retain Boulogne until 1554, then return it in exchange for two million écus; in the meantime, neither side would construct fortifications in the region, and Francis would resume payment of Henry's pensions. Upon hearing the price demanded for Boulogne, the Imperial ambassador told Henry that the city would remain in English hands permanently. During the treaty negotiations, two Protestant mediators—Han Bruno of Metz and Johannes Sturm—were concerned that Henry's war in Scotland was a stumbling block. The sixteenth article of the treaty made Scotland a party to the new peace, and Henry pledged not to attack the Scots again without cause. This gave Scotland a respite from the War of the Rough Wooing, but the fighting would recommence 18 months later.\nQuestion: How many days did it take for the negotiations to lead to a treat?",

On the other hand, other missions  were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than cultural imperialism. The first Catholic Church was built in Beijing in 1650.

The army led by Aung San fought in the Burma Campaign on the side of the Imperial Japanese Army. It saw a significant engagement at Shwedaung near Prome against the British in March 1942. Thousands of young men joined its ranks—reliable estimates range from 15,000 to 23,000. The great majority of the recruits were Burman, with little ethnic minority representation. Many of the fresh recruits lacked discipline. At Myaungmya in the Irrawaddy delta, an ethnic war broke out between Burman BIA men and Karens, with both sides responsible for massacres. The BIA was soon replaced with the Burma Defense Army, founded on 26 August 1942 with three thousand BIA veterans. The army became Burma National Army  with Ne Win as its commander on 1 August 1943 when Burma received nominal independence. In late 1944, it had a strength of approximately 15,000. Disillusioned by the Japanese occupation, the BNA realigned with the allied forces on 27 March 1945.\nQuestion: Who founded the  the Burma Independence Army in Bangkok",

The Broncos subsequently got on the scoreboard, with a 38-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Dolphins added to their lead early in the second quarter, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The Broncos cut into the Dolphins' lead, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, however, the Dolphins responded, with Tannehill throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace. Another touchdown pass from Manning to Demaryius Thomas &#8212; from 14 yards out &#8212; narrowed the Dolphins' lead to 21-17 just before halftime. The Broncos drove to as far as the Dolphins' 7-yard line on the initial possession of the second half, but after Manning was sacked by Dolphins' linebacker Jelani Jenkins for an 8-yard loss, McManus missed on a 33-yard field goal attempt. After the Broncos' defense forced a Dolphins' punt, return specialist Isaiah Burse fumbled deep in Broncos' territory, giving the football back to the Dolphins. Four plays later, Tannehill connected with wide receiver Jarvis Landry on a 5-yard touchdown pass to give the Dolphins a 28-17 lead at the 2:15 mark of the third quarter.

In 1917, Russian Grand Duke Nicholas assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917 , the Czar abdicated in the course of the February Revolution, and the Russian Caucasus Army began to fall apart. The Arab Revolt, instigated by the Arab bureau of the British Foreign Office, started June 1916 with the Battle of Mecca, led by Sherif Hussein of Mecca, and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. Fakhri Pasha, the Ottoman commander of Medina, resisted for more than two and half years during the Siege of Medina before surrendering in January 1919. The Senussi tribe, along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the Senussi Campaign. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.

With 1:07 remaining before halftime, the Lions countered, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Joique Bell. It was initially ruled as a fumble, but after review, it was reversed to a touchdown as a result of Bell breaking the plane of the goal line. However, Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib blocked the extra point attempt by former Broncos (now Lions) placekicker Matt Prater, leaving the score at 7-6.

Until 1752, the name \"India\" included all Portuguese possessions in the Indian Ocean, from southern Africa to Southeast Asia, governed - either by a Viceroy or Governor - from its headquarters, established in Goa since 1510. In 1752 Portuguese Mozambique got its own government and in 1844 the Portuguese Government of India stopped administering the territory of Portuguese Macau, Solor and Portuguese Timor, seeing itself thus confined to a reduced territorial entity in Malabar: Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Portuguese control ceased in the last two enclaves in 1954, and finally ceased in the remaining three pockets in 1961, when they were occupied by the Republic of India . This ended four and a half centuries of Portuguese rule in parts—thought tiny—of India. It may be noted that during the term of the monarchy, the title of the head of the Portuguese government in India ranged from \"Governor\" to \"Viceroy\".

In what was billed a potential Super Bowl preview before the season, the Falcons limped to a 1-2 start. After receiving the opening kickoff The Falcons got on the scoreboard first with a long, 14-play 75-yard drive which chewed 5:37 off the clock. They drove all the way to the Patriots 5-yard line, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by kicker Matt Bryant.

Two plays later, Brady hit back-up tight end Matthew Mulligan for a 7-3 lead. On the following drive the Falcons put together another long, strong drive to the Patriots 15-yard line. On 3rd-and-10, Ryan found Jacquizz Rodgers on a screen pass for 8 yards, the Falcons kept the offense on the field, though, but on 4th-and-2 Ryan couldn't complete his pass intended for Roddy White and they turned it over on downs. The Patriots took over and marched to the Falcons 31, aided by a 49-yard completion from Brady to Thompkins, before Gostkowski booted a 48-yard field goal, extending the lead to 10-3. Right before half-time, Ryan and the Falcons stormed 80 yards in 8 plays eventually, scoring on Ryan's 21-yard touchdown pass to Tony Gonz&#225;lez with 0:46 left in the half which tied the game at 10. After the first two drives of the second half ended in punts, the Patriots put together a 14 play, 89-yard drive, taking 6:15 off the clock, driving all the way to the Falcons 4, but were forced to settle for a 22-yard field goal, giving them a 13-10 lead.

The Falcons responded on their next possession driving all the way to the Patriot 18, but on 3rd-and-5, Michael Buchanan sacked Ryan, and Bryant kicked a 45-yard field goal, trimming the score back to 7 at 20-13. It wouldn't last though. The Patriots responded by racing 80 yards in only 5 plays, aided by a 44-yard screen pass to Edelman, scoring on an incredible 18-yard touchdown catch by Thompkins for the largest lead of the night at 27-13. Ryan was intercepted by Talib on the first play of the ensuing drive and the Patriots cashed in with Gostkowski's 49-yard field goal with 6:18 remaining, seemingly putting the game out of reach with a 30-13 score.

Down three scores the Falcons stormed 80 yards in 7 plays, taking less than two minutes, with Ryan hitting Gonzalez on an 11-yard touchdown pass, trimming the deficit to 30-20 with only 4:22 remaining.

However, the Browns' ended the day with a 34-7 loss to the Steelers. A number of Browns errors gave Pittsburgh opportunities to take a first quarter lead. After being stopped on their first possession, the Browns were forced to punt. Paul Ernster fumbled the snap, which resulted in a poor kick, and the Browns were called for four penalties on the play. The Steelers took possession on the Browns' 22-yard line and scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Ben Ben Roethlisberger to Hines Ward. On the Browns' next possession, Charlie Frye threw an interception to Deshea Townsend, which eventually led to the Steelers' second score of the game, a 26-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. The Brown next possession ended when Jamal Lewis fumbled the ball at the Browns' 40-yard line. The Steelers quickly converted the turnover, with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes on the next play to bring the score to 17-0. After being sacked five times and throwing for only 34&#160;yards on 4-of-10 passing, Frye was removed from the game and was replaced by second-string quarterback Derek Anderson. In the second quarter, Willie Parker fumbled the ball and gave the Browns possession. However, the team was forced to punt, and just two drives later, the Browns fumbled the ball again - this time on a sack by Ryan Clark of Anderson. The Browns were able to hold the Steelers scoreless through the second quarter as Roethlisberger failed to connect on his last six pass attempts of the quarter. However, the Steelers also held the Browns scoreless, and the teams entered halftime with the Steelers ahead 17-0. The second half began well for the Steelers, with an eight-play, 71-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie Matt Spaeth. The Browns countered with a long drive of 76&#160;yards that ended with a one-yard touchdown pass from Anderson to second-year fullback Lawrence Vickers, cutting the deficit to 24-7. However, this would be the Browns' only score of the game. On the next drive, the Steelers answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Heath Miller, giving the Steelers a 31-7 advantage. The Browns punted on their next possession, and the Steelers capped an eight-minute drive with a 31-yard field goal by Reed, giving the Steelers a 34-7 lead, which they never surrendered. On the Browns' next offensive possession, Braylon Edwards dropped a pass from Anderson, which was ruled a fumble. Following a Steelers punt, Anderson threw an interception to Ike Taylor on a pass intended for Edwards, and Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch ran the clock out, securing the win. The loss put the Browns record at 0-1, and allowed the Steelers to take a one-game lead in the overall series, 56 wins to 55. Following the game, head coach Romeo Crennel stated that he didn't know who would start at quarterback in the next game versus the Cincinnati Bengals. He also stood by his decision not to insert rookie Brady Quinn into the game, even after chants were heard from the home crowd hoping otherwise. On Tuesday, September 11, the Browns traded Frye, who was expected to start against the Bengals in week two, to the Seattle Seahawks for a sixth-round draft choice. The Browns are the first team since 1970 to trade their starting quarterback before Week 2. The team's general manager, Phil Savage, stated that Anderson was to be named the team's new starting quarterback, with Quinn moving up the depth chart to be Anderson's backup. The Browns also re-signed Ken Dorsey, whom the team had cut just ten days earlier, to be the team's third-string quarterback and mentor to Quinn.\nQuestion: How many points difference is there between only two field goals?",

In Yamashiro Province, the Hatakeyama clan had split into two parts that fought each other to a standstill. This stalemate was to have serious consequences. In 1485, the peasantry and jizamurai  had had enough, and revolted. Setting up their own army , they forced the clan armies to leave the province. The Ikki became a powerful force, much more than simply an armed mob.

The Ikkō, who had a complex relationship with the Jōdo Shinshō leader Rennyo, appealed to the common peasants in their region, and inevitably formed the Ikkō-ikki. By 1488 the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga Province overthrew Masachika and took control of the province. After this they began building a fortified castle-cathedral along the Yodo River and used it as their headquarters. The Ikkō-ikki and the Yamashiro-ikki part of the general outbreak of civil war.

This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game.

A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Mohács in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz.

Carrying on their recent troubling tendency of weak first half performances, the Seahawks fell behind 13-7 to the Broncos, who were led by first-time starter Jay Cutler. The Seahawks managed only 2 first downs and 67 yards of total offense in the first half, but remained in the game thanks to Darryl Tapp's 25-yard return of an intercepted Cutler pass for a TD.

With the signing of the Treaty of Berwick, the Second War of Scottish Independence was effectively over. Even before the signing of the treaty, in January 1356, Edward Balliol — weary and ill — had relinquished his claim in the kingdom of Scotland to Edward III in exchange for an annuity of £2000. He retired to live the rest of his life in the area of Yorkshire. David II returned to Scotland, to try again to deal with the rivalries of his lords as well as now among his ladies, as his wife Joan evidently objected to the English mistress he had taken during his 11 years in captivity.

At the time, it was also sometimes called \"the war to end war\" or \"the war to end all wars\" due to its then-unparalleled scale and devastation. In Canada, Maclean's magazine in October 1914 wrote, \"Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War.\" During the interwar period , the war was most often called the World War and the Great War in English-speaking countries. The term \"First World War\" was first used in September 1914 by the German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, who claimed that \"there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,\" citing a wire service report in The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914. After the onset of the Second World War in 1939, the terms World War I or the First World War became standard, with British and Canadian historians favouring the First World War, and Americans World War I. In the introduction to his book, Waterloo in 100 Objects, historian Gareth Glover states: \"This opening statement will cause some bewilderment to many who have grown up with the appellation of the Great War firmly applied to the 1914-18 First World War. But to anyone living before 1918, the title of the Great War was applied to the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars in which Britain fought France almost continuously for twenty-two years from 1793 to 1815.\" In 1911, the historian John Holland Rose published a book titled William Pitt and the Great War.\nQuestion: Which different wars are mentioned?",

Tate returned the opening kickoff of the second half 97 yards for a touchdown, blowing the game open 31-3. The Bengals countered with a 12 play, 85-yard drive, in just under seven minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Palmer to Jermaine Gresham, trimming the deficit to 31-10. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Bengals continued their comeback, marching 74 yards in 12 plays, scoring on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Palmer to Chad Ochocinco, trimming the deficit to a manageable 31-17. The Patriots ended any hope of a Bengals comeback on their next drive, engineering a 14 play, 81-yard drive, in nearly eight minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to rookie Rob Gronkowski, increasing the lead to 38-17 midway through the fourth quarter. The Bengals answered, racing 76 yards in under four minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Benson, bringing the score to 38-24 with just under four minutes to play and giving the Bengals some hope, but the Patriots got the ball after Malik Johnson was flagged for illegal touch on the onside kick. The Patriots drove all the way to the Bengals 7 and turned the ball over on downs, draining over two minutes off the clock.

Invited by Prime Minister Venizelos in 1910, the mission began its work upon its arrival in May 1911. Granted extraordinary powers and led by Vice Admiral Lionel Grand Tufnell, it thoroughly reorganized the Navy Ministry and dramatically improved the number and quality of exercises in gunnery and fleet maneuvers. In 1912, the core unit of the fleet was the fast armoured cruiser Georgios Averof, completed in 1910 and, at that time, the fastest and most modern warship in the combatant navies. It was complemented by three rather antiquated battleships of the Hydra class. There were also eight destroyers built in 1906-1907, and six new destroyers that were hastily bought in summer 1912 as the imminence of war became apparent. Nevertheless, at the outbreak of the war, the Greek fleet was far from ready. The Ottoman battlefleet retained a clear advantage in number of ships, speed of the main surface units and, more importantly, in the number and caliber of the ships' guns. In addition, as the war caught the fleet in the middle of its expansion and reorganization, fully a third of the fleet  only reached Greece after hostilities had started, forcing the navy to reshuffle crews, who consequently suffered from lacking familiarization and training time. Coal stockpiles and other war stores were also in short supply, while the Georgios Averof had arrived with barely any ammunition, and would remain so until late November.\nQuestion: How many years did it take to build the eight destroyers?",

Paley put the radio network's news operation at the same level as entertainment, and authorized White to interrupt programming if events warranted. Along with other networks, CBS chafed at the breaking news embargo imposed upon radio by the wire services, which prevented them from using bulletins until they first appeared in print.
