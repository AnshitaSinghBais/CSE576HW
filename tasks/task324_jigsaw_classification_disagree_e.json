You need to have committed a crime and be sentenced in order to receive a pardon.  This pardon is ahead of reality. If Mr. Snowden wants to establish his commitment to human rights.... there would be no better way of doing it.  No blanket pardons.  No pardon is given unless you have been sentenced.

To argue that Holmes having to reload more would not have made any real difference that night is to ignore reality.  Having to stop and reload, even if it only takes 5-10seconds, is a lot of time for many people to get to safety who would otherwise be in harms way had they not needed to reload.  Having to reload more also increases the chances that the gun might jam, or that the user might encounter some issue that would prevent them from firing the gun as quickly as they would want to.\n\nBrauchler is a slime ball who cost the tax payers millions while he lived out his (failed) dream of prosecuting a death penalty trial.",

However, I cannot for the life of me understand the logic of imposing a capital gains tax on someone who has lived in their house for over 12 years as he suggests.  That is a disincentive to sell!  Especially at these low interest rates, if you are a retiree and need the money it would make more sense to get a reverse mortgage or line of credit than to sell and pay capital gains tax.",

It’s looking backwards to the way it would like the world to be, instead of warning us about the train wreck that is coming.

The professor confided in him that he had just been to Moscow, where high-level Russian officials had talked of obtaining “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. “The Russians had emails of Clinton,” the professor told him, according to the indictment. “They have thousands of emails.”\nThe timing of the leak is critical. The rest of the world did not learn about the Clinton campaign’s and the Democratic National Committee’s leaked emails until months later. But the breach began on March 19, when Clinton campaign chair John Podesta clicked on a phishing link, the New York Times previously reported. In April, the Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear breached the Democratic National Committee, a report by CrowdStrike found. Those emails did not surface online until July 22.\"\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/putins-niece-catfished-george-papadopoulos-offered-kremlin-meeting",

A nurse is guaranteed 60% of her income at retirement, protected against inflation, in exchange for 6% of her salary today. Can you imagine the outcry if we suggested not only taxing that 6% of income, but also the yearly investment gains they must make? In practice, saving within a corporation is simply allowing physicians the same privilege of saving today for a more comfortable tomorrow.\n\nI would also point out that the 6% yearly contribution to a nurses pension approximates the 5% of physician salaries that the MOHLTC helps itself to every year.",

FAR less credible is a claim that missiles fired from those jets contained chemical weapons like chlorine gas. I've never heard of air-to-surface missiles carrying chlorine gas.\n\nHowever, we do know that the primary anti-government force in Idlib province is the al-Nusra Front, a designated terrorist organization and offshoot of al Qaeda. Their goals and tactics are the same as Islamic State to the east. And the UN has already accused al-Nusra of using chemical weapons, including sarin.\n\nA simple and plausible scenario is the following. Knowingly or otherwise, Syrian jets attacked an al-Nusra weapons cache concealed in a civilian area. The cache contained some of the chemical weapons that al-Nusra is known to have. The chemicals dispersed, killing civilians nearby. Rather than accept responsibility, al-Nusra blamed the deaths on the Syrian government.",

Called negative feedback.  Multiple mechanisms are active and the media cannot present a meaningful discussion.  Bottom line is that CO2 remains in the atmosphere for centuries thus depletion rate is very slow.  Unless we get emissions below the depletion rate CO2 will continue to accumulate.

In Canada when you turn 65 you get a government pension just like everyone who went before you and everyone gets the same amount. You also get  a government managed pension from CPP which is dependent on contributions made by you and your employers (the latter effectively being you too).\nI don't see any problem with this. I didn't see any problem with it in the past and when I eventually get to 65 I won't see any problem with it then.\nThis whole thing strikes me as a manufactured issue to promote division and animosity between the generations.",

After cash strapped Kamehameha V sold the Island of Niihau for $10,000 dollars cash the Hawaii Legislature became alarmed.\nSo, the Legislature passed a law, which was agreed to and signed by Lot Kamehameha V,  that bailed out the \"crown lands\" from debt, and made them also owned by the government. A three man commission was set up to oversee these lands. They were no longer able to be sold, only leased, and the money derived would go to the maintenance of whoever the King may be.",

The area had no trash, destroyed, broken or pieces of damaged sign debris in the area. Their normal process for any private property (including any signs) was followed by the crew. The process is to move the private property out of the work zone without damaging it and place it in the general location that it was located before so the \"owner may recover it\". They do not re-set any signs back into the ground or on poles. It appears \"that the signs were recovered by owners and they reused them\".\n.\nKari Goepfert\nAdministration\n.\nHence it is the  \"OWNERS RESPONSIBILITY\" to reset or remove downed signs.

It also breaks down the highest quintile to numerous subsets of data since the top quintile consists of anyone in the upper middle class up to Bill Gates.\n\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/20374\n\nSo, when you hear that raising the top marginal rate will raise taxes a lot on rich folks - it won't.

It's HUMAN FACTORS which cause or contribute heavily to the vast majority of air-related deaths. \n\nAircraft engineers long ago surpassed the reliability of human crew members, to the point where a systems failure causing an unavoidable accident is now exceedingly rare.

In looking through their website, it was unclear how they came up with the numbers. I researched FAIRus further and was astonished to find the following. Their founder, John Trenton is friendly to Holocaust deniers, formerly served as a lawyer for the KKK and is asserted to be a leading white nationalist. Fairus appears to promote hatred of all immigrants, especially non-white ones. The highly respected and credible Southern Poverty Law Center considers them a hate group, promoting xenophobia and natavism. Like many people today, you may have been inadvertently drawn into a racist organization based on their slick website. It might be enlightening to you to look into this group further.

People who allow their pet to roam un-tethered have rationalized their behavior and found a community of like-minded people, many of whom speak in a manner that indicates they truly believe they are morally superior to those who would \"limit\" their pets. And really, their behavior is rational. Don't we all seek to maximize benefit and minimize cost in nearly everything we do? Pet owners who refuse responsibility for restraining their pet seek to maximize the benefits of pet ownership (companionship, defense, conversational ice-breaker, etc.) while minimizing the cost (financial and convenience-wise). Meanwhile, the rest of us, including responsible pet owners, the pets themselves, and wildlife bear much of those costs. This practice is called externalizing costs, and it is how many industries, industries for which many of us have low regard, have made a great deal of money.",

According to The New York Times, Donald Trump’s son called Kasich’s adviser asking if the governor wanted to be \"the most powerful vice president in history,\" and promising Kasich would be in charge of both domestic and foreign policy. Donald Trump’s son reportedly said that his father’s role, as president, would be simply \"making America great again.\" Trump’s campaign disputes this account and denies it wanted Kasich over Pence. Ohio Governor Kasich has not come to the convention, even though it’s being held in his own state and he’s been in Cleveland this week. Ultimately, the Trump campaign ended up picking Pence. Last night, during his speech, Governor Pence spoke about U.S. foreign policy, saying Donald Trump would \"stand with our allies.\"\"",

With the continued development of Dion Lewis, the Patriots have another short range target to go along with the likes of Danny Amendola, Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski.\nIf the Broncos can duplicate a system that is similar to the Patriots, Trevor Siemian should be strongly be favored to win this qb battle because Trevor's on the field experience trumps Paxton so-called physical attributes as a quarterback.\n(continued)",

Number one is predator numbers will increase, because predator numbers trend the same as prey numbers. And any gain will only be temporary until habitat is damaged and a bad winter or two comes along and knocks the herd down.

More, if there were complaints about the behavior of the clergyman or religious person, that would probably have gone up to the same people within the diocese whether the person was a diocesan priest or a person in a religious order.  \n\nWhy should what is recognized and permissible under U.S. law have to conform to Catholic Canon Law?

In private business, every day you're looking for ways to save money, which results in innovation. With government, every time there is an issue the solution is more money, more employees, more oversight, more expansion. In private industry, you compete against others in the same business. If you're not efficient, you're out of business. A failing business can't call up city hall and say, \"I need some more money, please raise the taxes  and forward money to me\". Oh, and I need to hire more employees because I have shovel ready jobs. Soon, Hawaii will be similar to France, where most college graduates hope to work for the government and a job for life.",

The net cost of the solar feature is then $20k.\n\nYou're looking at the utility bill savings that this $20k gives you versus putting it in an investment.  $76,700 is the amount of savings given in the article.  What kind of return do you need on the $20k to get $76.7k after 30 years? Answer = 4.6%, AFTER TAX.  Still, if you can achieve your 6% after tax on the investment account then, yes, you would be better off investing the $20k.  But there are two big problems here: (a) 6% after tax is closer to 10% gross return, a difficult feat to achieve these days, and (b) the risk profiles of the two are completely different.

It's obvious this is happening neither federally or provincially and certainly won't under this government.

Nor can there be any doubts that its being is human.  It simply can't be anything OTHER than human.  It is, then, an actual --- not potential but actual --- living human being.

The man will be admonished by his co-workers and employer, and possibly lose his job. But few people in that situation, including the victim, want to see the offender receive a criminal conviction for his behavior.\n\nBy definition, the crime of sexual assault covers everything from the most horrific, violent attack on a helpless adolescent right down to the example I gave above. Yet many feminist advocates insist that sexual assault of even the most minor kind is misogynist and evil. And they've pushed society and its justice system in that direction.

You're assuming I'm not, and arguing against a position I don't hold.  \nYes, the US is a sovereign nation with every right to set rules for immigration.  The system should be designed to prevent 10-12 million illegal aliens in the country.\nThe point of contention is what is the best response for immigration enforcement when there are minor children (who are US citizens, just like you and I). In my opinion it is cruel to deport the mom, leaving the kids with another relative or uprooting to a country where they never lived.  (Would the kids be illegals in Mexico?)\nSo the idea is to come up with ideas at our beer summit that are more effective, but also reflect the better nature of our humanity.  Deporting \"bad hombres\".  Employer e-verify, strong ID requirements, and steep fines for hiring would stop the problem before it starts.  There is a middle way that works.",

However, we've all heard of people and communities who have \"lost their way.\"  Eugene's a bit different. IMO, it's a community which hasn't ever \"found its way\"...the City has tried everything possible (and fashionable) with downtown...First, of course, Urban Renewal and the razing of dozens of classic old buildings to be replaced by '70s era comcrete monstrosities.....and let's throw-in a downtown mall and block out traffic.  The City's still stumbling along trying to recover from that disaster.  \n\nThe \"dog ban\" is, again IMO, a lightweight effort to address the problems associated with the homeless and, especially, the \"travelers\" who \"hangout\" downtown.

There is no talk of him actually making a deal with the Russians, which would have been illegal, it’s just that the subject of sanctions came up. So nothing illegal in the phone call, but somehow it is a news item he had done so. It is a news item because the intelligence agency leaked this. This is a problem.\nJust as people before the election were outraged that FBI boss Comey decided to publicly mention an investigation involving Ms. Clinton’s email server, they should be outraged that a leak of a surveillance tape is causing a cabinet-level appointee of the President to be dismissed to prevent any suggestions the Russians were given a quid pro quo.",

I am not disagreeing with you that the number of homeless is out of hand, and the number of young people who travel here with their sleeping bags are problematic if you are just trying to get to work and earn some money.

You would do the community a greater service by reporting the current tax on the vacant lots, the amount of tax revenue during the exemption period, and the estimate of tax revenue after the exemption expires in 10 years. \nIt’s reasonable to debate if the incentive spurs development but I’ve noticed that many seem to view the MUPTE waiver for Capstone  as picking the taxpayer’s pockets, as if the city was making payments when in fact tax revenue for that property is up substantially.",

When in jail those 60 days, all of his personal items, ID, passports, Birth certificates, etc, were tossed out with the rest of his \"junk.\" He came out worse off than when he went in.

But my original post, that you took exception to, is correct-the map is largely red, indicating that the country, as a whole with the exception of a handful high population centers, saw a need for change.

Into a battle against the Vatican! Amazing blunder on his part.\nAs for Boeselager, I cannot recall exactly what vow he had taken. It was reported that he felt that the request to resign (and then the order of dismissal) was grossly unjust. Also, that the Order's proper procedures had not been followed.\nAnd this last element must have been acknowledged as true by the Order, since (alongside the Papal commission of investigation) there had begun an internal review enquiry, at Boeselager's request.\nAnd thank goodness that Boeselager did resist the unjust orders - or none of this nonsense between Burke and Festing would have come to light.\nI hope Boeselager's name will now be cleared, whether or not he recovers his old position.",

It was Georgia who launched a surprise attack in 2008 killing numerous civilians and Russian peacekeepers.\n\nIt should be noted that Putin said he didn't have a problem with Ukraine joining the EU. If was the EU who said Ukraine had to choose whether to join the Eurasian Economic Union or the EU but not both. This lead to the protests which overthrew Ukraine's government in 2014.

Infallibility pertains to what we need to believe, there are other levels which demand assent, such as things we must hold, though not neccesarily believe, and things we accept with a religious submission.

Budgetary decisions are key.  \n\nBy law, at least 70% of the total State budget for education should be expended by school principals (HRS 302A-1301).  However, the DOE is not complying with the spirit of the law, and school principals have discretion over only about 50% of the education budget.  It is true that some principals are successful, but they are too few and too far between.  They succeed in spite of the DOE bureaucracy and not because of it.",

The answer would be to do an in depth study of the problem to find out. If the reason is that it is in fact due to discriminatory hiring practices, then the implementation of a quota system is justified. If the result is due to a lack of diversity in qualified candidates, then policies should be put in place that lead to a more diverse pool of qualified candidates.

Any tactical victory the US will achieve over NK will be pyrrhic.\n\nThe only way forward for the US is to avoid war in Korea, but it is highly unlikely that Trump will accept a NK with thermonuclear ICBMs;  thus, there is going to be a catastrophe for 100s of millions.\n\n(Sensible critiques welcome.

Should he do so, the outcry from both houses as well as the general public would be be (rightfully) tremendous.

Householders who have lost good jobs, e.g Alberta, Newfoundland, but still have high credit limits, take on non-mortgage debt to manage . More stringent rules for mortgage eligibility are good, but hardly address the problems caused by lax rules and soaring house prices in the past, much less job loss.  In the past debt burden from housing arose from two sources: house prices and mortgage rates. Reducing mortgage rates and increasing wages could relieve debt and increase disposable income.  The first is no longer an option. The second won't happen in an economy based on real estate and its offshoots, as in BC and Ontario, rather than real business investment.",

There are (7) private multi-million/billion dollar Trusts that have been established to benefit the Hawaiian people including DHHL. The State of Hawai'i has been in control of these Trusts since statehood.  The state has been mismanaging and misusing Trust monies for things other than it's beneficiaries, thus Hawaiian people are homeless, on welfare, food stamps, medicaid, incarcerated, addicted and intoxicated.  With the kind of  money Hawaiian's have on paper, their statistics should not be this way.

When my cancer began 12 years ago I had to go to Switzerland and then Canada to get proper care.  Now days doctors, nurses, physical therapists and nurses aids are all referred to as health care providers.  At the same time Medical schools are now filled with over 50% women; I don't decry it but I think the insurance companies wanted it that way as they believe that they can get away with paying women less.  Fact is women physicians have always made less.  Just follow the money trail and you will see why our HC system is in shambles.  Look at the edifices.  When you go to a clinic it rarely  is advertised by doctors names; it has a name like Atlantic Medical.

Or, was the Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh Islamophobic for making a film about the mistreatment of women in Islam?\n\nI think no one can say Ms Merkel is Islamophobic considering Germany has been the most generous country on earth assisting Syrian refugees and migrants from many other (mostly Muslim-majority) countries. But if you say you want to ban the burqa I guarantee you will be attacked as Islamophobic (at least on Facebook posts such as this one, based on past experience). If the accusation of Islamophobia against those who want to ban the burqa is justified then Ms Merkel is also Islamophobic, which is absurd.",

The college uses an informal ratio of two or three hours for every hour in the classroom for part-timers. The issue though is with full-time faculty, they are well paid for what they do. I've done the math, and the full-timers receive, when compared on an hourly basis, way more than the part-timers, as well as, they have benefits, a pension, and lots of time off. Administration  and full-time faculty costs are very high, and those costs should be examined, with the goal of keeping tuition manageable for our students. Many have to rely on OSAP.

When things were going wrong and I  had to work with an agent to fix things I always found being calm, a little sympathetic to their situation and a little flexible went a long way. These agents ars just people like you and I with a limited capacity to fix things. When a flight gets cancellled they suddenly have several hundred unhappy people to deal with. Being demanding, boorish and sometimes utterly rude to them won't  necessarily change their options. I once followed a guy who screamed how important he was at an agent. While she couldnt get him on the next flight she got me on ..upgraded to 1st class!!",

The Hawaii project does no tunneling but with so much more construction. \n\nThis just shows that tunneling is very expensive and something not everyone understands. For example a federal judge on ruling on the Hawaii project insisted on a costly detailed analysis for rail route Underground involving tunneling through Beretania Street versus the detail cost estimate for the route going past the US federal courts near Aloha Tower. The cost difference runs in the billions but he couldn't believe that unless he saw it in black and white and spending a lot of money on engineering analysis of either route.

In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help.

No, what interests me is that Trump has decided to withhold some of the files.  \"I had no choice,\" he says.  No, he had a choice.  He's gone against the advisement of others who ostensibly know better too many times to say he had no choice.  I think, and its just my opinion, that Trump likes the idea of knowing what's in those files when no one else--or only a few others do.  My guess is that he'll leak little bits about the files, or make his own wild claims or speculations when he needs them, as a way to \"tease\" the media with a new story to distract from all the calamities that have befallen him.",

Initially, he was dubious about the value of the protest (which we parents were unaware of), so when he asked his father and me to sign the permission slip (which explicitly stated that the school didn't support it), we asked what had changed.  He said simply that he felt that the EarthGuardians were right that we need to think seriously about Climate Change and how we can work to improve our impact.  I told him that if his academic or attendance record were not sufficient, I would not support his choice, but they are solid, so I signed.

As a result of the parks on the outskirts, Paris has a very large percentage of green space. However, this is primarily used by and was intended for the use of Parisians.

So right off the bat, that makes them fundamentally different from other retail businesses. Cannabis' closest comparison is liquor stores, which do have state-wide a distance regulation, but OLCC opted to leave this to municipalities because they didn't feel they had enough data yet to make statewide restrictions.

These changes are not automatic. Unions negotiated with management and sent the changes to the rank and file for up or down ratification. They chose to take the reductions in income to protect their healthcare benefit and to protect the jobs of junior employees. \nIn contrast, the AEA negotiated no reductions in salary, one time bonus, increased agency contributions to healthcare primiums, and left intact no lay off protections for junior teachers.

I'm curious how far into that practice you've actually looked, because dealerships modify fuel systems at their own risk and are held responsible by the EPA for illegal modifications.

However, the victims' next of kin were all PART of the society, not physically and psychologically already alienated from it, for generations. Craziness was was short-lived. The young victims of the Cultural Revolution returned home, and began lives again.  They could \"move on.\"\n\nWhy didn't the Japanese boomer kids I went to school with in Vernon B.C. HATE me, taking cues from bitter, resentful parents? I wondered about that for a long time. They shared the \"good life\" before 1942.  These educated people were sophisticated enough to understand that their lives would return to them one day...and they moved on almost immediately after they were released.  And eight years is almost \"temporary\" compared to generations in which poverty was perpetuated, initiative stunted, by decades of government handouts.",

In other words, the rate of the rise would decrease but the level would still go up. \n\nThere is data showing that he was right.
