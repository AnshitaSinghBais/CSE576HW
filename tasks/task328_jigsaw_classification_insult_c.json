The Church is horribly deficient in updating its understanding  of it, has danced around the issues while modern science has increased out knowledge of humans and sex by the hundredfold.  Ignorance hurts way too many to be allowed to just continue because some clerics are frightened of what it might reveal (including about ordained life) and what it might lead to.  This is theology in pursuit of safety, not of God.  God's Creation is so much more calmly diverse and inclusive, and if the Church is to tear down its self-made divisions between believers in Christ, then it needs to open the window on all of the issues you mention for some fresh air per St. John XXIII.",

We also had the proposed capital move, complete with building designs that was headed for Houston/Wasilla, which preceded the cutesy political advocacy campaigns of \"Access Annie\" & \"Football Fannie\" of the early 1980s. Fairbanks didn't want more political power for Anchorage, and a slim majority of Alaskans totally and passionately agreed. Then there was the Gasline, with Canada promising to put in stripping plants since they would allow the gas but not the chemicals, as they operated in self interest. At the time it was just too much to process and Jay Hammond did a great job explaining that it was about keeping the Perm Fund out of Goverment control. The Alaska Senate now wants that Government control of the PFD.",

Until it does, states cannot legislate on its behalf, which is the essence of privacy. Until the movement accepts this as fact, because legally it is, it is either deliberately ignorant or committing fraud. That is the obvious.

Because federal action is necessary to recognize the unborn and because abortion is a private action, rather than action of government, the right to not be aborted is a postiive right rather than a negative right. Negative rights can be declared, and the impact is automatic. Positive rights require legislative action to secure. Again, there is a problem in the first trimester having to do with miscarriage. Until you can formulate language which stops abortion and does not implicitly include tort relief or",

His brainstorm of a 20% tax on goods from Mexico will give us the wall but it comes from your wallet.\nThe sanctuary cities might be forever in the courts as his powers cannot reach directly to the mayors to order compliance.\nNow you can continue to fear our chummy relationship with Russia as he will chat with Putin on his unsecured line about deals they can arrange.

Upon hearing just a few stories about administrators who were bad fits, I wondered whether the Cardinal Archbishop was not only short priests but also (hate to say it) short of pastors who could get along with the active groups of parishioners. To put it another way, to what extent is this tactic a way of bullying priests into submission, or a realization that pastoral talent is in short supply?",

Now Mormon missionaries are flooding Europe, to a degree. George Romney was a missionary in Paris, France. His success rate was poor.

Election of the ‘radical Marxist’ Jim MacFarlan, to use Johnson’s description, as federation president . . .brought a new class-consciousness to the BCTF’s executive office . . .MacFarlan and his supporters believed schools should be used as instruments of social change and that teachers’ influence in school management should be broadened . . . “ (Worlds Apart, T Fleming, p76, Deep Cove Bks)\nAny truce between the two contenders for power in education  — the union and government — is fiction. \nDo we have proof that the contest continues?

Equally they can withdraw that authority if they see fit. The mistake with the hierarchy is that they think they a have a God given right to authority and do not realise that a very large number of Catholics have withdrawn their authority to be led by them. I do not think they are aware\nSomewhere recently I came across a little story attributed to Mahatma Gandhi; where he excused himself from present company; explaining that he needed to join his people in protest, as he was their leader.

Moreover, Harry Reid first proposed this same birthright reform in his Immigration Stabilization Act of 1993 (TITLE X--CITIZENSHIP § 1001). By using Harry Reid's proposed immigration solution, DREAMER amnesty can be a win/win for both the DREAMERS and the American people.\nFor more details, see Liz Peek's FOX NEWS article, entitled: \"Trump, GOP should keep DACA but scrap birthright citizenship\" @ http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/09/04/trump-gop-should-keep-daca-but-scrap-birthright-citizenship.html",

One pilot was able to land an out-of-fuel Boeing 767 on an abandoned runway because he had experience as a glider pilot.

Thus, according to Trent and prior councils, anyone who approaches the sacrament in the state of sin does so unworthily (borrowing a Pauline phrase) and commits a sin. \nVatican II largely reaffirmed the sacramental theology of Trent while simultaneously pointing to a broader, less Aristotelian understanding of sacraments.

Most of these mistaken individuals believe in the concept of sustainable growth which is pretty embarrassing for them because, after all, sustainable growth is an obvious oxymoron in a finite world.  The answer to the original question is collapse.  There is only one outcome from perpetual growth in a finite world and that is collapse.

This is justified by the \"Time-warp\" argument that says time is meaningless to God.\n\nWe in the \"high\" church denominations certainly believe it is a sacrifice but one of praise and thanksgiving wherein we offer ourselves, our souls and bodies, imperfect as we are, to unite in the sacrament so that He may live in us and we in Him.

In the eminent domain cases I've been involved with I have never seen a landowner recoup enough in terms of market value to cover his legal expenses.

There is no such thing as \"secular marriage\" therefore, any true person of faith can not service or participate in any event that celebrates mockery of the divine law. This is an egregious sin and has eternal consequences. If there is such a secular law for marriage, cite its authority? Stealing divine laws and claiming them to be secular is a deception that will not be overlooked by the people of faith.

Well, duh: that's hardly news. Meanwhile, the deceptive and shameful headline implies our air quality deserves an F throughout the year, when, in fact, that's not true. I grew up where ozone levels deserved an F just about every day, except for periods immediately after it rained. Los Angeles in 1965 deserved the headline, not Eugene in 2015.

In year 2000 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (Rice v. Cayetano) that it is unconstitutional to have a racial restriction on who can VOTE for OHA trustees.  Later 2 federal courts ruled (Arakaki vs. State of Hawaii) that it is unconstitutional to have a racial restriction on who can RUN as a candidate for OHA. Conklin's testimony in opposition to this bill pointed out that chairman Ing is too young to remember the court decisions from 2000, but that's no excuse for a committee chairman who should have access to legal advice before introducing a truly stupid bill.  Ing kept Conklin's testimony out of the published file, but Conklin complained to Speaker Souki and the file was corrected.  For full details see\nhttp://tinyurl.com/hjmzp5d",

Trump is nowhere near that bad and you all who are supporting Hillary need to stop invoking that spirit because it causes those of us who don't just buy into hyperbole to go check HER record and statements from the past.\n\nWe all know about recent scandals that show that Hillary is corrupt to the core ... in bed with Wall Street, a warmonger (5 wars under her watch ... that we know about), and can't be trusted with classified documents, but more, go read her book It Takes A Village. Read her thoughts on why children should be taken from their parents and \"re-educated\" to \"societal\" standards. That's reminiscent of Der Furer too. And she put it in writing.\n\nIt's a good year to vote 3rd Party.  http://www.lp.org/",

Their ability to write/enforce effective/realistic regulations deserves an \"F\".\n\nThere is a pervasive obstacle generating attitude at the AOGCC that fosters non-compliance. The AOGCC makes my trips to the DMV seem like a vacation.  I do not work for Hilcorp, but I have experience with the folks at the AOGCC.  Much of what the AOGCC calls \"noncompliance\" is when a oil & gas company has a different legal interpretation of a given regulation. The AOGCC wants data spoon feed to them regardless of whether it is a regulatory requirement or not. In the eyes of an AOGCC regulator, if you use a different reporting format than what they want, it is \"non-compliant\" regardless of whether the reporting meets the legal requirements of the regulation. I believe that no State agency falsely claims \"noncompliance\" more than the AOGCC.",

Here is my point of view, he basically knows that he is not guilty of any collusion with the Russians, but he is not happy with the special prosecutor Mueller, coming up with an indictment, which is sealed, but was leaked to the news media, and it may involve someone that was partially involved in his campaign.  As I mentioned before, if he wants to he can later use his Presidential Pardon to clear things up.  That is his \"ACE\" card.  There is a major scramble by the DEMs, to cover up as best they can for HRC.  This stuff will not go away this time, because right now there are too many \"guilty players\" involved with, to include Mueller himself, sneaking around trying to find dirt.

KM dropped supplying our one remaining refinery, so they could make more profit exporting it. \n So the first problem is Chevron had to import oil by very dangerous train, which goes through several GVRD communities.  I've heard some of that oil may be the light crude which destroyed that Quebec town.\n  At a KM open house it was suggested the pipeline should stay south of the Fraser river, going the easy route to the Roberts Bank port.  That avoids expanding the pipeline through the heavily populated centre of the GVRD, expanding significantly the oil tank farm part was up Burnaby Mountain, and avoids tankers going through  Vancouver Harbour!",

NTSB accident investigations are indeed necessary, unfortunately, these are a long time in coming, by the time they are released the media and other aviators have lost interest.\n\nThere is a degree of merit in the OPs observations in this case. Having logged hundreds of hours as pilot in command doing aerial surveys with fixed wing aircraft, primarily low level salmon spawning stream counts, I learned that it is very important to keep the aircraft as light as possible, if unable to do that alter the survey procedure---- i.e. higher altitudes and shallower turns.\n\nThe Cessna 170-B is somewhat of a \"dog\", loaded.",

The social pressure to go to Church is gone, along with most family pressure. People feel that all they need is to be a good person, and they may be right.",

The issue is the Foundation lobbies the government obviously quite successfully for money. The issue is how many organizations who lobby the government take the PM and his friends to their island. The fact that the PM has known him for years, or that he was an honorary pallbearer at his fathers funeral or that everyone supposedly knows who the Aga Khan is is irrelevant,. Where the taxpayers money is involved there should be some concern about the optics of this whole affair. However according to the PM, there is nothing to be concerned about. I guess he forgot he was elected not appointed Supreme Leader.",

Other countries are unstable.  Other countries have less favorable tax structures.  Why would they even think about leaving?  Even if they have to pay a few % to keep producing here.  You say you know what it costs to produce oil on the slope. Really?  With or without an audit?  In the legacy Prudhoe fields, it is less than $10 per barrel.  But don't tell anyone, that's a secret.",

Sessions and his fellow travelers love this tool in the legal tool box to abuse their enemies. No one has died from an over dose of pot.

But he will be making reforms ironically in a very clerical manner. What would happen for instance if the next Pope that comes after Francis just unilaterally decides to re-classify every over again. Because that theoretically would be possible if he is the Supreme Legislator. \n\nAlso on the bishop's part, I highly doubt that is the case because as we have seen even with priests it's hard to get them prosecuted because of the problem of statue of limitation cases globally combined with the incredible burden of proof in even proving those accusations in the first place.",

If this author was attempting to program a logical circuit, there would be a number of glitches, to say the least. To test logical acumen takes a level of logic higher than that being tested. Author of the quiz fails.\n\nThis shouldn't be about 'tripping up' the mathematical mind. It should be about assessing it.",

In this case, as in most cases, the head of a sitting bishop and the scandal and notoriety of it all was far more important to them than resolution and the truth of the matter. \n\nThose five people had the opportunity to stop Ratigan dead in his tracks long before Finn heard one word of it.

This is a tactic used in war to erode confidence. \n\nThis is from a \"Field and Stream\" article written in October 2011 regarding Operation Eldest Son: \" In 1967, the Joint Chiefs approved of a plan to booby trap ammunition dumps found by Studies and Observation Group (SOG) teams in Laos by leaving exploding ammunition behind. The trick had been used in colonial wars by British troops who let booby trapped .303 ammunition fall into Pathan hands on India's Northwest Frontier.  The idea of Eldest Son was not to kill large numbers of the enemy but to destroy confidence in their Chinese-made arms and ammunition.\" \n\nLinwk:  http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/gun-nuts/2011/10/project-eldest-son-covert-ammo-sabotage-vietnam",

Any more than claiming a pastor in Fairview  with a tiny following after only living here a year is an Anchorage Christian leader .    Because of his personal grudge against Prevo he fails to list anything positive Prevo has done for Anchorage over all these years . How fair is that ? Anchorage is a better place for Prevo having been here.  What Wohllforth fails to understand is that basic teachings in the Bible don't change with time.  Anchorage's current most favorite liberal pastor not only doesn't condemn sin , he tells all who will listen basic sins in the Bible are wrong .  Perhaps worst of all is that Wohlforth knows who committed a crime , but won't report it to police.  How honest is that ?",

Using part of scripture while ignoring others is a quick way to fall into spiritual confusion and a quick way to deepen that confusion is ignoring the obvious working of the Holy Spirit in many women whom He has called to positions of leadership in the church.

Public support to create a process for improving representation has been growing. It's unfortunate the city council (and the subcommittee with Roberts, Franklin and Bader) is denying residents the right to vote on it-so sign the petition and pick up forms to get signatures from your neighbors. Signing the petition will allow citizen to vote for this issue and create a process to adjust the map and boundaries every 10 years, as our population grows and changes. Learn more at www.DistrictsNow.org. Residents in north Everett can walk 1.5 miles and say hello to 6 council members. There is a big difference between living on Casino Road and visiting for a meeting or shopping there-we need representatives from all over the city to have a better balance of government.",

The joy is that it we choose what we do and where we go. David makes a good point about the mental shift from being a saver to being a spender. That we found difficult after a lifetime of saving but after two years, we are there. The other difficulty I found was income tax. For over 40 years, my employer had made all the deductions and usually I had a refund. With many changes in my income sources it has taken time to adjust to making appropriate tax instalments to avoid nasty shocks come April.\nThat said, retirement is just great!",

On the other hand, she found herself more comfortable to grant a secret ballot for various reasons. I am gonna substantiate why. As an ex-presidential hopefully, she knows there is no way that she will ever become president of this country after having been snubbed by Zuma by replacing her with Nkosazana. This is a deep-rooted pain in her. By granting a secret ballot, she has made calculations that the balance of forces would tilt in favour of Cyril as next President of SA. She is the peacetime hero who is likely to be retained by Cyril. Her presidential ambition would become fulfilled by becoming an Acting President in the interim. She would have lost both had she not granted the secret ballot. A number of MPs would vote in favour of the motion of no confidence. These will be those MPs who are aware of the Cyril\"s calculated victory and have been lobbied to vote in favour of the motion.",

If these NAFTA negotiations were of such earthshaking importance why didn't Trudeau refuse to settle until after they were over?

It was also true in Iraq. Iraq wasn't a NATO mission though many of the coalition nations were NATO members. Most of the time I enjoyed my NATO mission in Bosnia and guess who was there with us? If you said Russia, you guessed right. As a matter of fact I met one of the heroes (Medal of Honor equivalent) of their war in Afghanistan. My men hung out with the Russian enlisted guys all the time.\n\nAs you know, my post wasn't about Trump's specificity, it was about what he may be doing.  Since I am neither a republican or a close confidant of Trump's, I can only speculate at what he may be thinking or doing.  I give him credit for being more than an imbecile or insane as I do Hillary which it seems that neither republicans or democrats can do for the opposition. I would never flag you nor anyone else.
