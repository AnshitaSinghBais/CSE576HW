Today we are \"awash in oil\" and PO is universally regarded as a classic example of alarmism. Human ingenuity prevailed, as it always will. Resources are not a constraint because we clever humans will find substitutes and adapt. \n\nIn the case of North American oil & gas supply, fracking saved the day. Canada and USA now have so much tight gas that they should engage in large-scale overseas exports. USA has so much tight oil that import dependence will surely be a thing of the past, so much so that DOE should sell off the Strategic Oil Reserve. And the PO 'theory' was merely the paranoia of ill-informed Chicken Littles.\n\nSerious analysis of global energy and climate change should reflect an understanding of the scientific literature regarding oil and gas supply. Concern over our long-term oil & gas supply is far from a dead issue.",

Suddenly he had a roster full of superstars and not enough money to pay them all with the new cap. The team slowly fell apart and conveniently Lacroix retires so that his \"genius\" reputation as a GM stayed in tact.  Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.  Remember that time when coach Q parted ways with the Avs and he went on to win several Stanley Cups with another team full of young talent? The front office sucks and Sakic is part of the problem.",

It is doubly odd that if their intent was to protect personal firearms ownership they just didn't say so, instead of writing a terse statement about militias. The whole point is moot at this time.

And some, not just transgender people, join for the  medical care.  In fact, they do this, because the military provides insurance to all active members and their family regardless of any preexisting conditions.  I knew a family (because our daughter had cancer) who joined the military so that their son (who was already diagnosed with cancer, could have the best medical care.  So what you and your MAGAphant lapdogs are saying is that you'd like to decide who, and for what treatments, should be covered by medical insurance.

The accounting firm and its competitors are not asking governments to build new office buildings or they will move to Regina.   Why should Calgary fund premises for a hockey business with perhaps fewer Full-Time Equivaent (\"FTE\") positions, compared to \"jobs\" filling soft drinks.\n\nAlso, one of  the reason the salaries are so high for the players might be that the employers (\"Team owners\") are paying a small price, compared to actual market, for their premises.  Is a CA firm could get office space at 50% of the usual price, it too could pay more to staff (or perhaps just pocket a larger profit). \n\nMy response would be \"what other projects do we, as Calgary, have planned, rather than responding to a glitzy developer's proposal full of \"plucked from air\" (\"PFA\" to Chartered Accountants) numbers ***that have not been independently reviewed for achievability nof assumptions and information used.***",

The stay home option would be very controversial. Ovechkin and a few others might decide to go anyway! That would be a slap in the face to the NHL. But what if the top 100 players decide to go. That would be a PR meltdown of epic proportions. There would be no possibility of retribution, as you can't fire them all. Would you cancel the league games or play AHL talent. Either way, fans would raise hell with teams, Rogers and anyone else who would listen.\nAnd then the Weasel might suddenly develop the need to spend more time with his family.\nWhich weasels never want to do because they are survivors. \n\nSo cut the crap, Mr. Bettman.

People who paid nothing for health insurance used the hospital emergency room when sick or injured, and if admitted would pay only what they could afford, if anything.  Everyone else had their bills padded to pay for the indigents.  After ACA more people paid into the system and bills were spread more evenly.

Too bad for those investors... the capitalist pigs. Russia's main export is oil and America's plentiful oil and gas was destroying their markets. \n     According to the smartest man in the room, the Russians join forces with a capitalist energy proponent (\"an imbecile and a fraud\") who praises the benefits of cheap American Oil, Gas and Coal. Upon the completion of the fixed election, rigged by the Russians, Trump unleashes the fossil fuel industry from crippling Obama era regulations, opens up drilling to once closed government properties and permits the construction of the two controversial pipelines. Oil prices drop everywhere. \nRussia's income shrinks. Are they that damn dumb?",

Letting this article go unaddressed publicly and be taken at face value, unquestioned, could only further feelings of isolation and internalized stigma that often already accompany mental health challenges. Articles like this one have the potential to keep young people from accessing the support they need and deserve-- something that can actually already be so hard to come by on campus (as a student, I've experienced this as have many of my peers). I really hope we can work toward a system where empathy is more of a focus than competition, and where students don't have to fear being stigmatized by their professors and other post-secondary faculty for mental health challenges.",

Most got to Vancouver through investor immigrants, rich new Canadians who bought citizenship by handing over lots of cash. Quebec is still running such a program, bringing in the better part of ten thousand new rich home-buyers a year, folks who then buy in Vancouver and Toronto.\n\nIt is silly to believe that the realtor's self-reporting (roll eyes) is catching and reporting all of the overseas money flooding into Canadian real estate.\n\nA better indicator for Vancouver and Richmond is student make-up of schools in the expensive neighbourhoods: Over a couple of decades, from less than 5% to suddenly over 70% having facial features consistent with Chinese ancestry.",

It is among the richest area in the country, offers quick access to winery and mountain getaway in the Blue Ridge Mountain area.  It will easily attract the educated and tech class who will have good disposable income to enjoy the mid to upper middle class life style this area can offer.

What I especially like about the story is sharing the personal dreams of fellow entrepeneurs and how they go about living the dream.  I am so sick of reading about politics, crime, foreign affairs, and the wealthy elite or homeless which hardly relate to most of the RG readers. \n\n So...yes!  Please focus on real stories about local citizens and how they make a living and contribution to Eugene and Oregon.  It would also be interesting to readers to learn more about the daily lives of professors at the University of Oregon.  There is so much life going on in our community that is rarely shared in the RG.  Get off the Trump kick and focus on what's real out there.",

Still, to the chagrin of my peers, I never let them point toy guns (or even their fingers) at a human and say \"POW!\" No squirt gun fights, playing 'Army', 'Cops and Robbers', 'Cowboys and Indians' or Grand Theft Auto type video games (These came out later and as \"adults\" they played them anyway...). And I screened (to the best of my ability) their intake of movies and TV. Perhaps I was viewed as a hard ass, but, I know first hand that it sucks to be shot. Yet, guns have always been an important tool in my life and I'm not one to throw out a hammer over a black thumbnail. I've kept them handy and I've kept them loaded.

Raising money is tough, sure, but it also helps you hone your message, learn how to connect with voters, and to listen to all of their concerns, hopes and dreams for Portland. There were 31 people running for the three open seats, and while there were some great people, many were unqualified to hold public office. No amount of money from public coffers would have changed that, but it might have masked it. More importantly, though, it would be immoral to take $145,000 for a 10 week primary cycle when that is just slightly less than the cost of getting someone who is houseless off the streets and into affordable housing.

So I'm wondering, if it's illegal to use cones etc. to cone of spaces, what if such items are simply treated as litter, and thus be discarded by city crews? That would be a pretty good deterrent as a 28\" traffic cone retails for around $20.00, so a scofflaw using two or more of these cones to privatize a public space ain't cheap if they get discarded often.",

Sometimes this process can take up to 5 years or more  (unless of course you are born into or married into wealth, like Trudeau/Morneau, then you see, these things don't matter).  What possible benefit to the economy can there be to the government limiting investment by small business or forcing the business to take that money out at a high tax rate before the money can be re-invested?

It would also be contrary to US treaty obligations unless Canada agreed to the tariff or the US gave the requisite prior notice that it was withdrawing from NAFTA.\n\nI'm really surprised to read and hear so many implicitly misleadeing reports of potential unilateral US tariff initiatives contrary to NAFTA without acknowledging that the US itself would have to forego the current benefits under NAFTA etc. in order to make such a change.",

Increased pipeline capacity in the U.S. allows to get more Canadian heavy crude oil  to the U.S gulf Coast area where the largest number of refineries in the world that can process Canadian dilbit are concentrated.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (IEA), U.S crude oil imports from Canada in 2016 reached a new level with an average of 3.25 million barrels per day. It reached a peak of 3.56 million barrels per day last November. That same month Alberta lost 13.000 jobs. Building new pipelines won't bring those jobs back.",

A drunk who doesn't flee the scene is very unlikely to come away with a criminal conviction. In fact, just a couple of years ago one of your neighbors went out to a strip bar, spent hundreds of dollars getting drunk as can be, ran over a pedestrian (dead) and was sentenced to no jail time even though he drove away and passed out on a nearby on-ramp, so even fleeing is no guarantee of jail.\n\nI do so wish you were right about the impact of MADD, but our culture still too readily accepts the massive CARnage imposed on us by intoxicated motorists without creating adequate legal sticks to fight back with.",

DAR head Bruce Anderson promotes an “herbivore plan” with a single herbivore species not on the aquarium hit list. “DLNR officials are looking at new rules to help ensure sufficient parrotfish...” The aquarium trade decimated Oahu herbivores and keeps recovery at bay, calling it “sustainable.” Over 2 months ago Governor David Ige deferred to DLNR (and former TNC) Director Suzanne Case to veto Senate Bill 1240 to end the aquarium trade. Anderson is still looking for a “Parrotfish Plan,” maybe stroking his chin. Anderson got the big picture: “It’s really kind of scary,” defending a voracious aquarium trade and then “planning” on a single species of fish to cure the damage. This is not reef management. This is collusion and conflict of interest.",

It's one thing to 'let it ride' in a retirement account hoping for modest retirement support.   It's quite another to have the extra income that gives you management/investment advice with the goal of creating wealth.   As in most things, wealth  increases your opportunites of success through mulitiple support structures, and this would include stock investment. \n\nI don't see any tax policy that changes that basic dynamic.   Government programs are hopefully designed to provide greater opportunity for those who would have very little otherwise.    It's why we've come to associate great wealth with 'privilage'.

Unfortunately that wasn't the situation. This year one of them could look much better than the other, both of them could be underwhelming, or both could be great. I prefer Siemian but I see him only making the cut if he is way better. If Lynch is even in performance with Siemian regardless whether it's good, average, or bad, he will become the starter.

In other words for the next 13 years counties cannot tax tourists any more than they can now after the passage of this act. \n\nIt's not a question of using state money for a Honolulu project. Mayor Caldwell even tried to show financial figures from studies by his administration that would confirm what he and the other mayors are saying. \n\nBut he was stopped by the committee for lack of time on testifying on the TAT tax. Isn't it odd that legislators who are so concerned about financing for the rail project are unwilling to look at the actual figures which prove a point that is in opposition to their legislation?\n\nThis just proves that the legislators are not paying attention to what the mayor is saying. They even got amount of money his administration has asked for, wrong. And they blamed their inattention on his \"lying\".",

It was ridiculous for the Ducks to have to play a road game on a Tuesday at 1pm. I mean, come on ESPN, you gotta do better than that. I know they wanted to keep the prime time slots for Kansas, Duke, etc. but seriously. Well, anyways, I hope Brooks can get back soon - but not feel rushed to get back - and the Ducks can be a bit more focused on Valpo and playing a good game Thursday and worry about the Maui Invitational afterwards.",

Then Germany, France, Canada. So this attack in the UK was just another battle in a continuing war. \n\nOne side or other must stop if there is to be peace.

Governments need revenues to pay for necessary benefits such as public education and health care. These will paid for whether with government taxes (deficits) or private fees. How will the carbon tax work with the existing tax structure? Infrastructure spending needs funds. If we need infrastructure we also need a source of funds to pay for it. These are new expenditures so a new tax would seem to be required. Maybe we don't need new infrastructure, i. e. gridlock forever.\n\nBTW Trump proposes infrastructure spending and without new taxes.

I obviously support a rebate, however I am absolutely appalled that the Assembly wants to cap any rebate to no more than $300,000 in assessed value.  Think about that - this is one of the most blatant examples of reallocation of wealth anyone has been brave enough to try in recent history.

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola.

At ten cents more people would be motivated to return them and cut down on the state's massive $$$$$$ intake. State of Hawaii don't want folks to return thier bottles and cans...another invisible tax on us. The return percentage in Michigan is 95% in Michigan.......much higher than Hawaii's 70ish%. On top of that it would virtually double the amount of money that homeless folks affected by substance abuse would have to spend on drugs and alcohol.

I think your characterization of traditional Hawai`i in such negative terms stems from misunderstandings similar to those that puzzled Cook and his crew.

I thought such extreme ethnocentrism was long gone.\n\nThe practice of archaeology has led me to admire the genius of Oceanic peoples in general and Hawaiians in particular.  I recently used my training as an anthropologist to investigate some misunderstandings between the British and kanaka maoli, as reported in the diaries of Cook and his officers.  I wrote up the investigation in the hope that it would help historians get past some of their ethnocentrisms, so they might glimpse a bit more of Hawaiian genius.  \n\nHere is a link:\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/hPhnsxQergggjKAW5tYC/full",

Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a \"sustainable, equitable\" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment.",

The Liberals were far from being close to what they originally promised Canadians and the provinces are now having to shoulder all the financial responsibility for the failed drama teacher's showmanship having to care for these people\n\n\"In June 2016, the government quietly released “preliminary costs” for the program, and pegged the costs 350% higher than Trudeau’s campaign pledge. That way, six months later when the updated financial figures became available – and Trudeau only went 285% over budget – the Liberals could pat themselves on the back and celebrate.\"\n\nThe Liberals are nowhere close to the projected costs promised during the election campaign which is EXACTLY like the promised deficit they corrected things by well over 300% above the original promise.\n\nCongratulations for once again buying into more Liberal lies.",

PSE has been running a massive ad blitz on all platforms, TV ads, push-polling by calling people at home and now going door-door, pushing for the massive tank in the middle of a dense urban area. The LNG facility would pump out 40 tons of carcinogens and 21,000 tons of greenhouse gases, accelerating climate chance.  There is no gas shortage but a gas glut. PSE is crying wolf. They already own the largest NW underground gas vault. #NoLNG253",

What has happened here is that Apple simply discontinued the much lower-priced iPad Air2 as it was too close in features  (6.1mm thin & laminated display) to the non-acknowledged successor the iPad \"Pro\" 9.7\" (6.1mm thin, laminated display, better cpu & true tone display) for $350 more than the Air2.    The new \"iPad\" is simply the casing of the old iPad Air 1 (7.5mm thick) with a newer A9 dual-core CPU and camera upgrade, but with the older non-laminated screen that is inferior to the Air 2.   If you want the same quality as before you now need to spend at least $799.  Thanks Apple!",

The uninformed reader likely now assumes there  were at least that many people in Alberta at that point in time.  Not even close. 1901 there were approximately 73,000,  in 1911  about 384,000, in 1921 there were 588,000 and 1931 to 1941 the numbers were 730,000 and 795,000.  Those people included at a minimum, Germans, Norwegians, British, Americans, Chinese, Canadians, and Indigenous peoples. Furthermore, the Amercian immigrants settled in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The only idealogical politics at the time was the economics of wheat, and not an equilvalency of Trumpian and far-right Republican conservative politics, which I believe is what Mr. Ibbitson for when he dangled this paragraph in front of the reader.",

The Reformers, seeing a church led by corrupt bishops in Rome, came to accept that when all is not well in the church look to the bishops of rome for the source of the difficulties.\n- However, in the case of these dissenters, they seriously misread not just Amoris but also traditions of faith in the church.\n- Council/Trent reinforced the use of the Eucharist as a control lever by clerics over the faithful.

It owes far more in the way of ideas and outlook to Buddhism. Sikhs believe that a god created the universe, and left some important lessons about how to live in the form of holy books. However, there are no miracles, there is no hell, no devil, and no messiah. A Sikh is expected to live as a \"soldier\" who defends the innocent; a \"scholar\" who trains his mind in the holy book AND in the laws that govern the material universe; and a \"saint,\" one who lives a moral and ethical life.\n\nThose who fall short of those goals are reincarnated to try again.

These are entirely expected, the math supports it.\nWas cannot be supported, are multiple mutations required for a Selectable Advantage, this is certainly a requirement for macro evolution.\nMuch recent work has revealed many Latent genetic and regulator instructions, in all life, that change the organism when stressed.  The changes follow a predictable pattern, when creatures are stressed in the same manner.\nThe Evolution Revolution, by Lee Spetner, lists many specific examples of this.\nWhat appears to be going on, are environmental adaptations brought about, by built in information, not the gradual accumulation of micro evolution. \nReality suggests, creatures preloaded with information.",

We bought our home about 8.5 years ago and the value according to our tax bill has doubled. We bought our home to live in and to get close to a high school for our children.\nThe real estate agent who sold all of these 7 homes ( and made a handsome commission) was blunt in that inventory (lack of) was the key factor for the sky high prices. \nBy the way all the occupants of these new homes renovated after they moved in.

Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him. If this were Lynch's first season with the team, I'd agree with your logic but I believe his leash will be shorter - especially since it is also tethering the new coaches and possibly higher.",

We should all be outraged at this and demand they stop all the hyperbole and redesign the whole system so it cannot help but succeed. Government should provide basic regulation and provision for the most poor, but the market should provide the choices for the rest of us.

The State Department said she was thoroughly vetted and asked such questions as \"Do you seek to engage in terrorist activity?\" and \"Are you a member of a terrorist organization?\"  No terrorist worth his or her salt would answer yes.  Farook was able to bring in a fiancé who he married and together committed a horrendous terrorist attack.  It is naïve to believe that other terrorists can’t do it.",

Therefore the advisory partners serving the same large corporate as the audit staff serve, might hope the pesky questions from audit staff can be swept away lest they upset the lucrative advisory business.\n\nThe only solution is to disallow audit and advice offerings from within the same firm.

Those holidays happen early enough in the school year that there is no way I wouldn't be able to make up the work, but since the teacher had scheduled a test for that day, with no way to make it up, I was out of luck as far as he was concerned.

No matter how you look at it, rail is going to cost us BIG time forever.  Hawaii is fast becoming a place for only the rich.  OK, maybe rail doesn't bankrupt Hawaii, but it's sure going to be a tough place to raise a family if not already.  Oh and BTW, I have inside information from a construction industry company.  In the next couple of years, after all the present super condos in Kaka'ako are built, construction will die.  No more buyers!",

That the people of this nation of immigrants and polyglot religions could forgive trumps every insulting comment towards every element of this society except white men(and even there he had to insult McCains service) is unforgivable. Trump will come and go but to me what is most frightening is that so many on the left side of the political spectrum didn't even vote out of pique that their chosen savior wasn't on the ballot while those on the right turned out for a man who is so manifestly unfit to be president of the nation I put my life on the line to serve. I didn't enlist to protect the rights of white men. Our nation is great and strong already because it is so varied. Sad.",

A nation with a 365.7 billion dollar trade SURPLUS, doesn't impose a \"trade embargo\" on its partner.   A good part of that Chinese prosperity you reference comes from the pockets of Americans.  We're a nation of \"consumers\" not (regrettably) producers and, being so, have an unsustainable economy.  We're running on borrowed money and borrowed time.  Here are the numbers for you: \n\"The U.S. trade deficit with China was $365.7 billion in 2015 This is a new record, up slightly from last year's record of $343 billion. The trade deficit exists because U.S. exports to China were only $116.2 billion while imports from China hit a new record of $481.9 billion.Nov 21, 2016\"  With the globalized economy, outsourcing and the rising-to-dominance of multinational corporate economic interests, we have, quite literally, \"given away\" our prosperity",

No previous \"middle class\" in human history had the dough the Boomers do, so they use it as the wealthy always have, i.e. as a carrot to bind their \"adult children\" to them and to encourage the desired behavior from them.

The common take on all this is, if you are going to reform the tax code then go all in , have a proper discussion and assess the impact of the changes proposed. This is ramming something through based on identity politics, pitting one segment of society against another.When a government takes the position, that its our way or the highway, they are betting that the people are just as mean spirited as they are.",

Of a small number of people.\n\nAnd yet this paper, and the activists at the campus in question, pretended - yes, pretended - otherwise, getting the RCMP involved (waste of time and money, no crime was perpetrated) and prattling on endlessly about alleged rape culture at Dalhousie. \n\nHyperbolic victimhood claims, a poison akin to dark age star chambers.",

If 'bump stocks' were, by rule, turning a semi-auto into a full auto weapon, the bump stock weapon would now come under the same requirements as owning a fully automatic weapon.  Now let me ask you, given the choice between buying a manufactured fully auto weapon or the same gun in semi-auto and having someone install and set it up with a 'bump stock' thereby making it for all practical purposes a fully auto weapon, which one do you buy?  Bear in mind, with the simple rule changes already suggested, you would for both guns now have to go through the same application process plus pay the $200 a year tax on each.  Further, with the MFG fully auto you can set the selector to single shot and still have good accuracy from 400 to 600 yds, whereas the gun with the 'bump stock' can only spray on full auto all the time and the best score we got from the one we had was 10 inches at 100 yards, shooting 5 rounds (far worse using a full banana clip)?",
