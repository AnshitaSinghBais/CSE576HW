(Whatever you might think of Obama as president, he was a lousy general.)\n\n3rd is to stop laying out military planning and operational details and timelines in the media for the convenience of the enemy.\n\n4th is to get the other NATO allies in this war to step up their efforts substantially.\n\n5th is to put Afghanistan leaders and forces on notice that this is not a blank cheque operation extending through infinity.\n\n6th is to refrain from the nation building stuff that has proven costly, problematic and divisive.\n\nWorth a try",

He said that all of us have been a minority in the room at one point or another.  We have the experience to know what it feels like to face a majority, sometimes hostile to our own beliefs.    Rather than push those experiences aside, he would use them as a point of empathy, in particular for those dealing with other races, gender issues, ect...  \n\nWe have bias Charles.  There are very few decision that we make that don't include an element of  bias.   We experience in life in many ways that affect our future decision making.

In 2016 our family premium increased 52% ($400 per month).  Unfortunately If we did not participate in mandated ACA participation we will be taxed (penalized) by the \"IRS\" (the policing arm of ACA)  per \"shared responsibility\".

The Founders of the U.S. despised political parties, because they feared partisanship would cause those who should be serving the people who elected them to serve their own party and what it can do for themselves instead.  Streep has a right as a private citizen to speak in any public forum.  At least she spoke the truth and from a love of country.  Those who take an oath to serve the country and those who elected them and to defend the Constitution--and then tend to their own parties--need to be brought to task, I am certain.",

Yes, it was stupid to say, and it really is just more red meat being thrown to his uneducated base.  2)  His speech, overall, is a plea to get help from the UN and its member states to solve problems.  This is shocking, since his base has been hateful of the UN for at least two decades (take note of how often you hear the dog whistle \"globalists\").  3) Throughout the speech, Trump just can't help acting like a petulant child and egotist.  Just read it, you'll see what I mean.  It's almost like you can tell the parts of the speech the sane people wrote and Trump's words.",

In some states, peeing outside could have you classified as same, which is beyond ridiculous. There are other, similarly ridiculous ways one can get classified a \"sex offender\". \n\n\n\nMaybe a ranking of sex offender class 1 to class 10 or something. If rape is a 10, and peeing outside were a 1 (without a minor present), I wonder where this might fall. The woman obviously had to be skeeved out, and has her person violated in a clear way, but I doubt even she would rank it a 10?",

Your assumption is that no one has truly grappled with the church's position, or that cynicism over the church's ability to \"heal\" is both unreasonable and suggests the church incapable of appealing to reasonable people.

I've put up with this indignity because there's nothing in the gospel suggestive of this nonsense, and the church has its attractions.\n\nPlease don't impute motive to me. I'm a mother, I'm not \"hostile\" to life in the womb. I've held the same position both as an atheist and a practicing Catholic.

Briefly, I'd suggest capitalism's foundation of endless growth and exploitation of resources on a finite Planet is hugely to blame.  Big Oil has known the effects of it's pollution on the atmosphere and oceans for decades yet hid it to keep the train rolling, blocking alternatives. There is evidence the Bush family was involved in keeping Tesla's free radiant energy discoveries hidden, so oil could prosper.  There are misconceptions about population that cannot be explained in a sentence, but \"common knowledge\" fails to accurately capture the global realities in this area.  Demographers know that the world population will peak near 8 Billion and then decline, for example.  And a small proportion of wealthy people use up and waste too many resources, while corporations are allowed to pollute with impunity.  Hubris is a problem, but who's hubris is worst?  What about the military?",

You are not in position to judge others that find themselves in the self pay individual market, because that is something you will never have to deal with. That doesn't make you smart, that makes you lucky. Ironically enough, when I retired, I had access to the employer group plan on a self pay basis. I chose that option. Later the employer switched to a union plan, and the union didn't allow non-union retirees to continue to participate.\nThe individual market has always been awful. It's better today, but still not as good as a group plan. Unlike \"one premium\" group plans, individual plan premiums are very heavily age weighted. Many older people could never afford coverage without a subsidy. I'm glad those people get a subsidy today. BTW, I don't get one. It isn't about \"free\" HC, it's about being affordable.

In some parts of the world wild plants and animals were entirely replaced by the domestic ones. Alaska is an exception to what happened in the rest of America where only small bands of the wild ones survive. \nWell over a million humans fish, gather and hunt Alaska each year.

Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms.

As was made plain by their questioning of former FBI director James Comey and the three intelligence chiefs last week, Democrats have moved the goalposts on the Russia investigation. They’ve all but given up on their quest to prove the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 election — the charge at the heart of the ongoing congressional investigations. They are now solely focused on pinning a charge on President Trump and ultimately forcing him from office. With the collapse of the collusion narrative, they’ve seized upon “obstruction of justice” as the accusation that will, they hope, get Trump impeached",

Two, if you don't have the greatest pass protection and you are facing a great pass rusher, as a coach, should you be rolling out the QB more?

Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.

The law prevents judges from imposing almost any time in jail for probation violations like not doing treatment, contacting victims, and not showing up for probation appointments.

The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

From my experience this increase ranges from 1.5% to 4%, with increases being higher for older buildings that typically need more maintenance. If you also add on the property tax increases enacted by Council, a landlord's costs can increase between 2.8% and 5.3% (this assumes a property tax increase of 1.3%).\n\nFor condo units built pre-1991, the rent guidelines only allow a rent increase of between 1.5% and 2%. This means that landlords of these units are more than likely not able to recoup a significant portion of the increased costs, which is not fair or equitable. Landlords should be able increase rent by the same increase to maintenance fees and property taxes.",

You have already said that you don't care about disenfranchising 3 million or more people up to what seems to be an unlimited number as long as your side still wins.

Something will bite Trump in the ass and result in something hurting the US on an international level, and result in fallout on the international level. Take your pick what this is? NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Just last night my Bible study group was looking at 2 Cor 3 where Paul says the glory of the Spirit of God being greater than the glory of the Law. We need to be pursuing the Holy Spirit with our entire hearts.\n\nThe Holy Spirit has been teaching me a lot of lessons and at the top of that list is that He gives gifts to whomever He wants regardless of gender. Often the person He calls and empowers to do things is the last person we think should do the job. Number Two is that He absolutely loves doing things that are outside the limits we try to place around Him. I've seen Him do some pretty amazing things. A third is that He has a host of higher-priority things for us to do than argue endlessly in the defense of spiritual topics. He doesn't need us to defend Him, He wants us to represent Him so others will see His love in us and be drawn to Him. He has promised to bring us into all truth. Let Him do that.",

No, this is normative developmental and universal sexual behavior.  And by universal I that means that it is practiced by all human beings at one time or another in their lives.  And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

Their provincial alcohol sales policies are still strictly controlled by the Alberta Gaming & Liquor Commission. However, the number of private alcohol sales stores, hours of operation and products available have expanded greatly from the days of government run sales outlets. Alberta now has about 22,000 different alcohol products available to consumers, from everywhere in the world, compared to Ontario's 14,000.  Alberta's government revenue from alcohol sales has also increased proportionally, while creating about 5-times as many private sector jobs.\n\nIt's kind of funny that Alberta has a more 'liberal' outlook to alcohol sales than does Ontario.

And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point.

History is already beginning to show Obama for the true leader he was - a person who stayed cool under pressure, had the fierce intellect, and dispassionate character to do what any good leader should do - carefully balance every aspect of a scenario, and make the best decision, based on the art of the rational and the possible, not the art of blind ideology, reactionism, or image-courting.\n   Curious that some of the trollian troglodytes thumbing down this article call Wente a left-winger - Wente may be many things folks, but she is decidedly not a 'leftie'......whatever that moniker actually means to those who use it. \n  I found President Obama to be personally inspirational, a real class act, and one of the few public figures I truly admire. I look forward to reading his memoirs.",

They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax.

All I see is cuts and more cuts, no oil tax reform, and the further degradation of our state infrastructure and services. All because Alaskans seem willing to completely gut quality of life in this state in an attempt to avoid paying taxes. Enough!

Treason is sometimes a very beneficial action long term and the preservation of the means to engage in treason can, and has, prevented the necessity of resorting to armed insurrection to compel change.

Others, once finished with their limited free articles for the month, can try just putting his name in a google search, because his articles will come up on other sites as well.  I live in the DC area, so have always subscribed to the Post. This year I took out a digital subscription to the NYTimes,  to support journalism that continues formerly SOP practices such as fact-checking, often ignored by Fox, and totally missing from sites such as Breitbart.",

So while it may make more sense to keep Canadian dividend stocks in cash account or TFSA that doesn't equate to saying your RRSP should only hold US stocks.

What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

He was only 100 feet off trail and only 4 miles from his truck.

Was he defending against an advancing bear? \n\nAnd, of course, there is the not so uncommon occurrence that he went in with the intention of not coming out. Suicides some times seek a place\nwhere they can do what they want to do without being found. A case in Northern California just a couple of years ago was like that. A very successful\nyoung lady of 25, graduated from college in accounting, had been working as an IRS investigator. She broke up with her boyfriend and decided to shoot herself with her own government issued sidearm. But she purposely hiked deep down into the bush off a trail. Practicing fire crews found her a year later.",

Creditanstalt was owned by the Rothschild family, and in 1938 the current Rothschild was imprisoned following the Austrian Anschluss. In 1939 he was allowed to emigrate to the US.\n\nSo the Creditanstalt collapse, though it was a key \"domino\", was triggered by the finance and banking collapses in the US after the 1929 Crash. Creditanstalt is still a way to blame Jews for the Great Depression and WW II.\n\nFor me, the lesson is that trade and finance are internationally linked, and any tampering with the free trade of currency and goods is a very bad thing.",

Essentially governments can move the needle about 0.5% in GDP growth in either direction so 0.5% less than what it would be under a BC Liberal government is not devastating, but in power for enough years it can add up to quite a bit, that's 5% less in size if in power for 10 years.",

One can personally oppose abortion on a personal level while still support keeping it legal otherwise believing its not the state's job to enforce morality.  Paul Martin personally opposed abortion, but was a strong supporter of keeping it legal.  Opposing something personally is quite different than wanting it criminalized.  Where Scheer stands though is a bit of a question.

And the number 57 is bigger than 12.\n\nWhat I have always said, consistently, is that investor immigrant programs have been BIGGER than foreign buyer matters, in terms of contributing to Vancouver's high house prices.\n\nThe other post writer made a comment about foreign buyer matters, and so I responded to that matter. And so no, that does not imply that I have contradicted my previous statements. Everything I wrote is consistent.\n\nHopefully if you re-read a few times my comments about numbers like 57 and 12, and 9 and 2, it will become more clear to you.",

Elsewhere in the report there is a consultant recommendation to build a replacement stadium with 30,000 to 35,000 seats that would be \"expandable\" to 40,000 for special events, but that is NOT what spending $325 million would deliver.  The cost estimate was not done by that consultant but rather by a Stadium Authority engineer who assumed a capacity of 31,000, period.\n\nA facility almost 40% smaller than what we have today will NOT meet the needs of a growing Oahu population over the next 50 years.  Settling for a shoebox stadium would be as foolish and shortsighted as it would have been to build the Stan Sheriff Center with only 4,000 seats as some originally advocated.  NO TO THE SHOEBOX.",

This might show that more care has been given to each design by each builder so that the changes are minimal or no mistakes 9X. \n\nGiven the greater number of inspectors, better engineering value can be done for each change.

Because I understand bear behavior and the risk, I don't much enjoy cycling in bear country, though I don't have much choice sometimes.  The problem is that most cyclists aren't well informed about the risks they're taking.  Anyone thinking about mountain biking in brown bear country should read about the USFS employee who was killed here in Montana last year after running into a grizzly.

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

Christ CAME to humanity because the Creator so loved. \nPeople do not have to be Christian, or Catholic, or white, or western, politically partied, to be of good will; to be socially conscious to work to peace, security, and fullness of person. Quite the opposite is true in the \"humankind\" world of the Creator.\nIt is time for true leadership to seek the core of humanity where we are “fully alive” rather than “dis-membered”, feverish with venom, disowned and disowning.\nIf we Catholics believe that “where two or three are gathered in my name…” then so be it. Just keep it to yourself and relish in the Presence and in the results for all. Let Jesus do His thing and not pretend it’s “us”.",

Only four of its 25 European allies - Britain, Estonia, Greece and Poland - meet the minimum standard of spending 2% of GDP on defence.\"  As the article goes on, it gets worse for the Euros.\n\nI liked that mash-up your link provided.

Some of these people will be discharged without a place to go and they end up on the street and seek shelter for the nights.

Once these people are on the street it becomes even more difficult to find them safe housing and often the assisted living homes with refuse them for one reason or another.

The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by United States President Richard Nixon—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared drug abuse \"public enemy number one\".\n\nToday, the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for an end to the War on Drugs, estimates that the United States spends $51 billion annually on these initiatives.\n\nWar on Drugs did not create Drug Cartels.",

It's effectively a healthcare tax, but taken before the money even hit your pocket, so you never missed it.

We now know pedophilia is intractable, but ephebophilia behavior is more complex. Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy.

This is especially so for those who are 70 years or older, whom nowadays make up 75% of the congregation. They have aged-acquired hearing loss. Combine that with a church building with dodgy acoustics (mostly the ones that are square boxes), and the homily just becomes a muddle.\n(Those mediaeval church builders got it right with all those curves and columns. They couldn't rely on a PA system!).\nIf Ireland imports foreign priests the wheel will have turned full circle. 50 years ago Catholics in a lot of English-speaking countries used to struggle with the broad Irish brogue of priests imported from Maynooth or All Hallows!",

Even in cases where the perp confesses to a forcible rape, I support testing of rape kits so that past rapes by the perp might be identified, but if Joe and Jane admit having non-violent, non-forceful sex, but Jane later claims it was not consensual while Joe claims it was, rape kit evaluation (as in DNA analysis) is not material.  I suspect that rape kits in all violent or forceful rapes are routinely tested, while it is only Joe and Jane cases that are not.

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites.

DACA violates the EPC because it's applying the immigration laws differently based on age and date of illegal entry. There's 2 illegal aliens both 25 years old one isn't being deported because they entered illegally before 2007 and the other is because they entered in 2008.  Laws in the US have to be applied equally, even the immigration laws.\nPlus the fed govt is actually committing multiple felonies by awarding EAD's & SSN to DACA's which would violate 8 usc 1324.\nThe States are wasting valuable tax payer money with a frivolous lawsuit.

For the first time in this country's history, the consumer could buy goods and services with someone else's money, and the natural price constraints of the free market system were removed from the equation.  The cost of health care has been spiraling upward since.\n\nThe only way to bring health care costs down is to return it to free market incentives with a National HSA Program for the first $10,000 per year as the only option.  If you don't spend it, you keep the money.  That'll introduce competition and eliminate claims processing costs, while reducing the cost of health care by 40-50%.   Who objects?  Insurance companies and claims processors who are removed from the picture, except for claims over $10,000, which is only 5% of the claims.  The average person under 65 incurs less than $4,000/yr.",

If they wanted a basic education, that was where they had to go, both native and non-native.  It's a sad narrative that young children were removed from their reserve homes remote from school and that some were abused during that process.  However, not all the teachers/instructors/administrators were pedophiles; many worked with the best of intentions towards their charges.  Like the native residential schools, young students of my generation and earlier generations, no matter where they went to school, were often physically abused for reasons of discipline.  And why, even today, are First Nation organizations bringing young students from remote communities to a \"segregated\" residential high school in Thunder Bay where there still seems to be issues with students being able to cope with the move.",

The word “gender” is used wrongly by most people as a synonym for sex mainly because for 99% of people in the world, the two are the same. But just because they are the same for you, it doesn’t mean it is the same for everyone.\nEven though there are two MAIN sexes, there are at least 16 types of sexes among humans. Many of these people are classed as “intersex”. Some people are born with XXY chromosomes or other combinations as well as ambiguous sex organs (sometimes totally ambiguous, sometimes with breasts and a penis, sometimes with a vagina, womb and flat chest, and sometimes with working or non-working sexual organs).\"\nThis isn't \"garbage,\" as you suggest.
