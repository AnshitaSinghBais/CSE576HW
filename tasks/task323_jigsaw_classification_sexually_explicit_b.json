Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.

Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy.

As far as definitions go, society as a whole must through elected representatives define what various actions and scenarios violate law and what consequence to apply.  As I see it, we have trivialized sexual assault to mean anything a woman does not like.  Rarely is sexual intercourse the issue.  No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.

He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

Indeed, one of the fears being voiced about Amoris Laetitia is that it undermines these core aspects of the sacrament.",

And that means by clergy and laity alike.  As I have already said, such church teachings lead to unnecessary shame & guilt especially among those young people who do not have parents sophisticated enough to set them straight.  This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.  Unfortunately, this can lead to a psychic disconnect in which a person as an adult begins to lead 2 lives, a public good life which he or she can admit to and a private one which has been unnecessarily labeled as “evil” one by the church which he or she cannot admit to.

The issue is that these nurses were not looking at this man's genitals for medical purposes. They were doing it because they wanted to, to satisfy a personal desire. The article is not, \"Nurses open body bag to examine strange growths on a patient's genitals\" or something along those lines. This is not a case of medical intrigue, what it is, is a case of nurses using their position to take advantage of a patient - dead or alive.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police.

People can use each other, people can have sex thinking only of their own pleasure, people can abuse or rape. Those are perversions. Anal intercourse or oral sex are not perversions as long as both partners are willing and enjoy it. \n\nThe ideal, however, is that sexual activity be between two monogamous people who love each other. Then it is indeed \"making love.\"",

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?\nTrump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to. Yet women are encouraged to be 'adult' by becoming sexualized - by having sex. How great is that? Ask, who benefits, and how.",

Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites.

These ideas, promulgated by heretics and paganss, were taken up by Christian ascetics who also distrusted pleasure. Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture. It is a wholly man-made concept, stemming from the thought that sex is nasty.\n\nRD trots out the standard traditionalist twaddle in support of this.",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

It is not.  \n\nThe question of having sex in a way that \"avoids pregnancy\", which seems a new one in this thread, is definitely more complicated.  While the Church generally teaches that natural family planning is not sinful, it can be used in a way that the Church teaches is wrong.  \n\n The point is that we are not supposed to use people for gratification, even ourselves, even with consent.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

That starts right at the top of the pile & trickles all the way down to the local level. Case in hand would be the crooked officials that collect per diem when they live in Juneau or when they state that they're in session but are not at all. Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks. Why can't you just get off your fat lazy butt & take the time to deliver it to the office rather then use an unnecessary service. Waste!",

When Trump said a woman who gets an abortion must be punished, he got the Right to Life vote. \nAnd no, they should not have voted for Hillary either.

I've had more than one friend who was sexually assaulted by a brother growing up, and in my extended family, one brother orchestrated a gang rape of his own brother.  Maybe because of my history, in my own family there were lines of privacy around intimate body care that were never disturbed or questioned, so I can imagine being uncomfortable with the situation LW described.",

Quotes:\n\nThe purpose of the diocesan Synod is to assist the Bishop in the exercise of the office proper to him, namely, that of governing the Christian community.\n\nThis purpose determines the particular roles to be ascribed to those priests who partake in the work of the Synod \"as wise collaborators with the Order of Bishops, their helpers and chosen instruments, and who are called to serve the People of God\"[5]. The Synod also offers the Bishop the opportunity of calling to cooperate with him and with his priests some members of the laity as well as some chosen religious.\n\nThus any attempt to place the Synod in opposition to the Bishop on the grounds of \"representation of the People of God\" is contrary to the authentic order of ecclesial relations.\n\n[And drat this character/word limit!!]",

The NFL simply excludes pre-game ceremonies. lol.\nSame can be said for \"The Greatest Quarterback of All Time\",  who brought down the NFL. Colin Kaepernick. IMUA!",

One such atom of fluorine is identical to all other such atoms of fluorine, regardless the source compound from which they are released.  This is just elementary chemistry.\n.\nThe only substances ingested as a result of fluoridation are fluoride ions, identical to those fluoride ions which have always existed in water, and trace contaminants in barely detectable amounts far below EPA mandated maximum allowable levels of safety. \n.\nThe US CDC estimates that 75% of daily fluoride intake in the US is from water and beverages.  \n\nSteven D.

Trump was unsuccessful in his efforts to bully Comey.  In a pique of rather typical Trump anger, he fired him.  Did he have the authority to do so?  Indeed, he did.  Was it another demonstration of his sociopathic behavior? Indeed, it was.  \n\nYou like to use the term \"fake news.\"..Actually, that term is a reference to \"false/untrue news\"....rather like \"alternative truth.\"  Mr. Trump's actions are REAL and the media reports them.  You may not like that, but, that's doesn't make it \"fake news.\" G C",

That would be like a biologist not familiar with evolution.\n\nVoter ignorance is not only the strongest finding in political science, but quite possibly all social sciences (Somin, Downs, etc.).  I'm not even aware of a single paper or study on the subject which suggests that voters aren't ignorant.  I've seen arguments by people like Trende who say it doesn't matter (heuristics), but nobody denies that voters aren't ignorant.  That's plainly false.  If you're not familiar with rational ignorance, you need to call whatever university you graduated from and demand a refund.  This isn't even something that is disputed in the academic community.

Things went sideways a couple of decades ago when the contractors were trading vintage airplanes for modern military surplus,  which was good for the CIA and good for the contractors.   Somebody in Congress got bent out of shape,  and then used C 130s and Neptunes,  and WWII vintage B-24s started to have wings fall off and the like,  and people got killed.  No resolution, yet,  to the contract fire aviation conundrum.\nAs far as the USFS/BLM \"full time\" fire fighters,  they are paid seasonally,  April through October.  Pension, health care,  and Federal benefits are based on a 12 month year and the Feds are paying into those accounts while the fire fighters are drawing unemployment,  traveling in South America,  working as ski patrol and instructors in the off season.  When that program was begun,  many were left out due to age",

Remember the devil refused to be submissive to God.  For this he lost eternal life.  Let us seek that what is good and pleases our Father in Heaven and not that what pleases mankind, especially when mankind, like the devil refuses to serve God but chooses rather to serve his own desires.  Don't forget why Jesus was born and why He died.  To save us from our sins and free us from the chains that keep us imprisoned to our sinful natures.

The sticking point is what type of immigration is most needed in this country, and balancing it with existing jobs, and also building towards the future. Bringing in relatively young skilled workers is the goal of every country, and often the competition is high, as other developed nations are facing the same problem. The Conservatives need to tailor their immigration policy, to fit the needs of the country now and in the future. Which means that while we will still deal with refugees, we have to be more practical and selective when we are opening the doors to immigration. Immigration should be viewed the same way as, healthcare, infrastructure or anything else government does. Does it make sense, and will it benefit the country.",

Your comment is dismissive of the concerns of many Alaskans that the knee jerk reactions to elephant ivory also includes the legal trade in walrus and mammoth ivory. When you promote blanket regulations that fail to recognize differences in legally obtained ivory from that obtained illegally, you are being what I like to call elitist. Having no compassion for those who make a living due to trade in legal ivory or other commodities that might be the least bit controversial.",

The tax burden to build HART needs to be spread as widely as possible because HART will \"benefit\" all in the State. But, operation and maintenance of HART needs to be approached differently because we on Oahu will be subsidizing it in perpetuity, just like we subsidize the Bus and the Handi Vans, so the question will become, \"should the state overall subsidize the O&M of HART or just Oahu property owners?\"",

Not one holds water. Paul Roderick Gregory, a pro-Russian, anti-American \"economist\": “The Trump Dossier Is Fake -- And Here Are The Reasons Why.” Gregory is, to be kind, a Russian stooge.

Look at the legislature - the vast majority of them are committed to continuing rail regardless of how far behind schedule or how much over budget it is.  \n\nFor me the bottom line is simple.

He was told to say something that would elicit a positive reaction from the international markets even though his heart and mind is not into it. So these announcements will buy him time and make him look good at the end even if none will be implemented. So when Zuma goes, he will tell us that he tried. If Zuma survives or his favourite becomes president, he will simply focus on something else and ignore the plan. This is the attitude that has made the NDP difficult to implement.

This process is separate from a contract termination.  The Portland Ordinance effectively eliminates a landlord's ability to terminate a month-to-month rental agreement/contract.

What business model is it to give money away to people that are too lazy to work, give subsidies to illegal immigrants that don't pay taxes, and force businesses to pay people with no skills or motivation to get skills more money? You might be able to argue a not-for-profit business model, but then again, our government isn't a not-for-profit. How do businesses make money? In tough times, they cut budgets, streamline processes, re-negotiate contracts, and cut non-essential services. Our government is built to spend and is incapable of 90% of the items I mentioned. Why are billionaire business men successful? Because they don't waste money. I think that is exactly what we need in government. We know what Hillary and other life long politicians bring us. This country CANNOT sustain the level of spending and waste that is currently has. At this point, Trump is our best option to change this. \n\nI agree corp subsidies should go away for profitable corps",

The easy analysis holds that Trump’s jihad against decency has wrecked the Republican Party, but the damage is far more extensive than this. \n\nThe problem of Trump is not simply that his opinions far exceed his knowledge; it’s that what he does know is so hostile to democracy, not only in the Republican Party or the United States but in the world.

A parent chooses not to inoculate though a government entity (school district) has a rule that requires up-to-date inoculations.

The street dealer has nearly none of those costs that have to be added to the sales price.  Dope from street dealers is ALWAYS going to cost less. Street dealers will never go away. On top of that , pot customers have been breaking the law for many years so there's no way all of a sudden they will start obeying the law and telling their long time connections to take a hike because they want to pay more.  All of this is basic common sense that for show they say doesn't count.  On top of that legal pot gives cover to street sales on many fronts. Then there's the X factor that's causing many pot shops to go out of business in the lower 48---cheap prices . You can't operate a business without making a profit , which is why many local pot shops will fail.",

It's very, very difficult sometimes, but I believe that when we make those choices of faith with our hearts, with love, we are making the truly Christ-like choice.

In April of 2012 there was a murder in my neighborhood, someone shot two men in the R&R Garage in broad daylight. One died. It is still unsolved. And they never solved the murder of Aylett Hanson either. Now we have another instance of two people being murdered on the trail system.

I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.",

It seems to me that all of the bigger retail establishments are moving Honolulu to be like the Paris of the Pacific. While Paris is the shopping capitol of Europe, and Hong Kong still reigns, it seems with these developments that Hawaii is trying to become a similar magnet for the Pacific region south, west and north of the islands (with us yielding the mainland to that of Los Angeles, San Francisco and such).",

And if my recollection is correct it is the same native corporation that was very outspoken about ending the pebble mine project. I guess its ok to beat the environmental drum when your not getting a cut of the profits! I think the natives should be truthful and admit the only connection they have with the land is when they are drilling oil, mining, or working on bombs through their department of defense contracts making their corporations and shareholders millions of dollars! Pretty hypocritical to tell another country to stop enriching themselves when you haven't.",

Most Bach Festival members and donors first heard of this abrupt change via Facebook or other casual media rather than via news from the festival.  Bad.\n\nThe general public has no way to know whether replacement of Halls is either necessary or good, as we don't have the same information the festival board and UO leadership does.  We just know that we liked the music he made. \n\nHowever, there is general consensus that the UO announcement was one of the worst PR face-plants the community has seen in a while.  On the OMG scale, it ranks with Nancy Shurtz hiring Funk to issue her apologies for blackface and has had a similar effect in the community. The statement, a vapid slurry of internal UO pander-mush and culture-blather, is largely devoid of useful facts.

Let us do some medical logic that we have on hand and add the studies on gun violence for decades on top of that.

Same as for murders, the gun is handy to settle disputes more often than having to search out other means when one is angry. There are more murders by guns than by knives or baseball bats.   Research shows that people kill with guns because there is little time between the thought and the event. Having even a small buffer zone can prevent someone from killing someone else or killing themselves.\nI have talked to many people who did not commit suicide and the reason they did not.",

Also infallibility applies to doctrine, not to conduct. Any attempt to infallibly condemn conduct is merely an interpretation of a point of view.

Here are some great ideas to make that happen:\n- hit people who make over $200K with higher taxes\n- exposed investment earnings to higher tax rates\n- keep interest rates low to support uncompetitive Canadian businesses\n- stifle successful Canadian businesses with more demotivating environmental legislation\n- block the export of Canadian products (especially oil)\n- lower the value of the Canadian dollar so it buys less\n- increase CPP payments and make it harder to collect\n- jack up utility payments by 20% and call it a carbon levy\n- make divorce easier but not necessarily less expensive\nAny of these economy crushing actions sound familiar.

The food there is great but can be very spicy. Then head to Japan and stay there for nearly a month. Leave there and go to Hawaii. Get married, learn to body board or surf. Check out the black sand beaches and beautiful ranch land. You can see some volcanoes as well. from there, head to Colorado directly from Hawaii.

My guess is that there is a lot of resentment among EU leaders at the Brexit vote and very little good will or interest in being generous with the UK on trade matters.   This,  along with the various EU industries which will be happy to see British firms out of their market,  will make negotiations difficult indeed.  I am sure that many German,  France,  Dutch etc firms are rubbing their hands at the prospect of less competition in their market and will object to opening that market to their former competitors from the UK.",

More troubling is how much Democrats seek to exploit a tragedy for political gain before the bodies have even been buried and how quickly the Star-Advertiser wishes to sell out the Bill of Rights and turn us into a totalitarian state with citizens as slaves to an all-powerful government. Big government can't control illegal drugs, do you think they can control illegal guns?  What I'd like to see is a Star-Advertiser editorial on what happened in the Catalan Referendum and how the Spanish government violently turned on their own defenseless citizens.",

I don't claim to know everything that's going on in the local youth sports scene, but feel I'm more plugged in than someone who \"loathes sports.\" To be clear (apparently I need to spell things out here) I'm not saying it doesn't happen - all I'm saying is it's not as \"typical\" here as some backwater mainland town. Sorry that your grandsons grew up in such a messed up community where this kind of behavior is tolerated. Nothing was done to them because your family is \"known\"? Lucky you.",

What kind of crappy life is this for a young man?  It is no life.  These violent men are destroying our community.

One way to proceed is by starting with 2 formal corrections by cardinals - one private, one public - and then the invocation of a perfect council (w/ papal approval) or an imperfect council (w/out papal approval) which then decides if the pope committed a public heresy.  If so, there is a choice between the Jesuit option and the Benedictine option as to how to warn the faithful to beware of the heretic and the heresy.\n\nBecause of the many heresies being promoted by this pope and his minions, I think the best way may be the posthumous process by which the next Pope basically turns Francis into the papacy that never was for a variety of reasons including but not limited to any combination of the possible coercion of Benedict's resignation, the lobbying of the St. Gallen mafia in the election of Francis, top 10 heresies, pertinacity, etc.\n\nBenedict also expanded the papal ministry to include an active and contemplative member.

How can one reasonably engage in a debate with somebody who preemptively condemns and dismisses the motives of those who would oppose her position?

Smoking involves setting something (in this case, tobacco) on fire and inhaling the resulting smoke. Smoke from any source can be hazardous to health, because the tar that's produced can clog up the lungs, the carbon monoxide damages the heart and circulatory system, and the numerous chemicals of combustion can cause a variety of cancers. None of these elements are present in vapor because vapor isn't smoke. So Rep. Pollet is incredibly mistaken when he refers to incredible damage to people's health. Nicotine is a stimulant that's about as harmful as caffeine. Both should probably be avoided by someone with a serious heart condition, but can prove quite helpful to those without such a problem. Both can improve mood, alertness, and concentration which explains why smoking is so hard to quit. Vaping saves lives by providing the nicotine sans the garbage delivered by smoke.",
