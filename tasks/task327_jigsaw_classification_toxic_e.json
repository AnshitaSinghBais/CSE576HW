Sorry, this Canadian assures you that we have our proportionate share of nutcases--its just that they don't have access to the kind of weaponry you nutcases have; thus your carnage.\nRe: countless normal people have guns and aren't killing. Undoubtedly true, Joe, but the evidence I am discussion and you are ducking is statistical evidence.

However, the name of the book (John) is not necessarily the name of the author or a contributor. I was trying to say that the identity of the beloved may in fact change throughout the Book of John as a sort of guessing game for the reader. Apostle John is a possible candidate for the beloved, but John is not named as someone specifically \"loved\" by Jesus, as is Lazarus. There are plenty of contradictions among the books of the Gospel, and I suppose many are intentional as a device for allowing the reader to gain awareness. 'Sower's Sevens' (from number sets) suggest to me that the four books of the Gospel were under the control of one party early on, so John passed through the same shop as the other books at the same time.",

House prices go up, people feel richer and vote accordingly; house prices go down 2% each and every year for the next 20 years and people who made bad investments vote for somebody else. Also, cities rely on property taxes, home prices goes up, property tax revenue goes up. Increasing the mill rate is not popular but sucking in more taxes because house prices go up is a pretty slick way to raise taxes.\nCentral planning has failed everywhere it has been tried, fire all city planners and remove all zoning restrictions and the free market will sort everything out.",

In Australia, we have never had statutes of limitation for serious crimes, and I was surprised to learn that some jurisdictions in the United States and Europe do have them.  In the case of civil claims for damages, limitations statutes create certainty for business planning, so that after 6 years in Australia, you cannot sue for tort or breach of contract. They encourage claimants to sue quickly, and recognise the possibility that with the passage of time memories fade and evidence will disappear. Such statutes can operate unfairly where the damage does not appear until after the 6 years has passed. For that reason, in Australia, courts can extend the period in the case of mesothelioma as well as child sexual abuse. They are unfair in the case of child sexual abuse and should be changed where they exist.",

How should they acquire the necessary training to compete for a limited number of high-tech jobs? If denied education, their remaining choices are to go on welfare that depends on their unemployed status, or work in low quality jobs (quality having been driven down by the large amount of competition for the remaining jobs). Neither of these is a good option - quite frankly why should anyone want work their hands to the bone in dead-end jobs so the economy can screw them?

I personally remember Jefferson Airplane, Santana, Rare Earth, Fleetwood Mac, Canned Heat. Most of these were held in the \"Sports Arena\" which is still there on Fireweed and C Street. In the 70's I saw Kiss  open for Savoy Brown at the Sundowner Drive-in Theater. At that time most people there had no idea who Kiss were and were somewhat shocked by their costumes  and theatrics. Gene Simmons has recounted this concert as one of the strangest ever. I also remember when the Beatles passed through town and overnighted at the Westward (now Hilton). There was an article in the Times about a fan who snuck up to the floor the Beatles were on and ran into George in the hallway.",

Since you brought up facts, his predecessor also inherited a deficit, and solved it not by pointing fingers. I might like to add that the so called deficit was created by Sullivan who lowered the cap every year and then poof at the end of the year we would have a surplus. How long have you lived here?

Our roads from the valley to the coast all run mostly through valleys and over passes to another valley. For one thing, that's where the people live. For another thing those are well-defined routes with relatively flat land. Bypassing the meanderings of the valleys requires massive cut-and-fill operations including blasting and grading. The tough basalt of Mary Mountain and other high peaks narrow the valleys and cause choke points that would require tunneling to bypass. Miles of tunneling. All of that is very expensive, so you might consider that even with the 17.7 million mishap (I can't call it a mistake because there was no way of knowing) the chosen route was likely cheaper than more direct alternatives. Like the Seattle tunnel that was so expensive when it got stuck in granite no one knew was there, there was no other route, and the added costs were worth the result.",

And before you continue to wax pious in defending 'poor Amy', consider just how much harm 'bearing false witness' can do:\n\nSix months ago a young Muslim jerk-wad in northern Nigeria named 'Al-Hajji Da'uda' falsely accused Bridgette Agbahime, a Christian preacher's wife, of 'blasphemy' and incited a mob of his friends against her.  They beat her to death.  Maybe beheaded her (although this was later denied).  He was arrested, along with one of his friends.  Doesn't help Mrs. Agbahime much.\n\nTHIS is why folks like me so vehemently object to Dumbitchski's making false accusations against Gregory Jones and his family.  Because if she and her ilk keep REPEATING such lies, eventually one of her nitwit followers is gonna have a worse than usual day and take it out on the first hijab-wearing woman he sees shopping in Carr's.  And/or her kids.\n\nI don't wanna see that kind of 'witness' (shahiid) here--not for me and mine and not for you and yours.  Not for anybody.",

Obviously the NDP and Green Alliance would like the Liberals to step forward, as it would ensure that this Alliance would always have enough votes to pass legislation. There is little up side for the Liberals as you could be looking at a government that would serve out the 4 years. By refusing the NDP must nominate a Speaker which puts the seat count in a tie. The Speaker can break ties but to do it continually would be political suicide for the NDP. The bargaining point here for the Liberals is to gain some input on the legislation in exchange for not voting against it, and putting the Speaker and the NDP in an awkward position. The Greens would have to temper their demands as well as the NDP, and in effect you could have the House working together as three parties . My bet here is this is exactly what will happen, for a least a year or two, and then a new election.",

Also in this poll , Putin's approval rating is over 80%. Now that Putin is attempting to gain favour with Trump to rescind the sanctions, the Russian people will slowly warm up to America.\nRussians are well aware of Putin's iron fist given his history with the FSB. They fear him and respect him in the same breath. Putin is said to be worth $50 billion USD. So this mutual admiration thing going on between he and Trump is no accident. Putin needs Trump to rescue the Russian economy . Nothing more. Trump may be looking to expand his real estate empire moving forward. That's just business. \nHowever this persistent hacking by Russians on American democracy is a real sticking point for America. \nI'm curious to see how this drama plays out.",

Check it out on Google...   I agree with 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, who wrote in 1997 that recognition of Indian country in Alaska would create a \"blizzard of litigation\" as more than 200 tribes try to define the extent of their governmental powers.  \"The litigation permutations are as vast as the capacity of fine human minds can make them\", Fernandez wrote.",

The early Christian gathering was a Jewish sect led by James, the brother of Jesus.  The Catholic religion is a construct, commencing with the Jewish Christians expelled from the Jewish faith after the destruction of the Jewish temple 70 CE...about ten years later. This is a partial introduction to what is 'true' regarding the Catholic faith.  Jesus according to Scripture preached the end times were upon us, before the generation dies out the kingdom would come, before the disciples can visit all of Judea the end would come.

A tax system that can confiscate private property or put someone in jail is not compatible in a free society based on individual liberty & private property rights. In part it is a redistribution of wealth from people who have earned it to people who have not earned it. An income tax means the government decides how much of the fruits of my labor I am allowed to keep. The weaker private property rights are, the less freedom we have. People who have no property rights at all have no freedom at all. The income tax was the 2nd tenant of Marx & Engels “Communist Manifesto”. Our Founders supported consumption taxes in the form of tariffs & excise taxes. A sales tax is a consumption tax.

For a kid who grew up during WWII as I did, just being up close to that Flying Fortress gave me goose bumps; watching it land made me think of  tattered, damaged bombers returning from a raid over Europe, barely making to a British airfield with an engine missing and wounded crew aboard.\nAnd  they are so small inside, yet had a crew of 10  crammed in there, pity the poor guy rolled up in the ball turret--all of this in a windy non-heated, non-pressured thin-shelled cylinder at 40 degrees below zero at 25,000 feet.  And even with all those guns, the \"Fortress\" suffered heavy casualties over Europe unless protected by long-range fighters.\nHard for folks today to understand what America  was like when we were fighting for survival and most everyone felt involved.\nThey were our Greatest Generation.",

This way when weather becomes a catrosphe for them (i.e little rain), they can pull on geothermal, wind, and solar.

I would personally like to see the Constitution reopened to reaffirm the superiority of individual rights, reaffirm absolute equality of individuals under the law and as our supreme societal value, remove all language pertaining to group rights and/or affirmative action, to establish that 'my family was here first' is not a reasonable argument to receive special rights/privileges and or demean other citizens/residents, and to establish once and for all that all Canadians are entitled to all the benefits and responsible for all the duties equally therein. However, I also recognize that other stakeholders/interest groups/provinces want to open the Constitution for entirely different reasons and that it is very unlikely we could achieve consensus on change at this time.

The best that could come from this is realization that the government sector has no business being in the pension business, and transition government employees to 401K's as soon as possible, which puts them on par with the private sector for retirement benefits.\n\nRetirees of a certain age with no options should be least affected by the solution paid by innocent bystanders, which is everyone",

If the City and County of Honolulu had the power to raise the GET, they would have done it years ago and my bet is it would be significantly higher than the 4.712% that they currently charge.

At first, they were able to serve as priests only in parishes that were under the jurisdiction of Slipyj.  It was not a pretty struggle, and the RC hierarchy did not give in easily.",

Teachers like it because it shifts the burden of teaching and instruction on a piece of technology. \n\nWhen my kids went through school I was amazed at how little reading and writing they did, especially writing. 4J schools gave them very little, and at best random, instruction in grammar and punctuation. They read mostly contemporary fiction that focused on black and white issues of social justice rather than challenging works that made them think. \n\nThere are charter schools all over the country giving a quality education to kids from underprivileged backgrounds, but the teachers' union and the status quo will keep those kids in the dark for the foreseeable future.",

Two turnovers by the offense gave SD the ball in Denver territory. INT from Siemian was a horrible no-call. \n\nBuffalo. A tipped pass for a TD and three 50+ yard FG's by the Buffalo kicker.

Jones and the fraud/theft of estate funds by his wife Katharine P. Lloyd who worked at The Hawaii Community Foundation as VP. Ms. Lloyd was one of Hawaii highest paid top executives until I reported their acts to the FBI and Lloyd immediately resigned from HCF. Jones's office investigated his wife and found \"no wrongdoing whatsoever.\" Many more victims have since come forward and reported these crimes to the FBI, US Special Prosecutor Wheat and Chief Federal Judge Seabright. Jones was recently arrested for DUI at 8 a.m. on September 9, perhaps on his way to work at the AG's office? \"Me no see nawting brah...\"",

I remember watching Al Haig's pompous comments to the press (\"Constitutionally, gentlemen...\") and thinking, even as he was speaking, how foolish he looked. Anybody who lived through Watergate should have known that the Speaker of the House was next in line for the presidency after the VP, and Haig had a front row seat during Nixon's final days in office.\n\nCome to think of it, I hope Donald Trump doesn't see this movie.

And besides, the writings of anyone who believes in Christ can be inspiring; and afterwards regarded by others as God-inspired. So where does that leave all the believers today in regards to the gift of prophecy and inspired writings, or rather, are believers less gifted than she was? I don't think so. Believing we are less gifted would be denying the indwelling Spirit of God. People need to live for Christ today and stop resorting to writings of someone who has lived almost 200 years ago; using them for their guide and spiritual teaching.

I've been looking at proposed rates for the absolute cheapest Alaska individual health insurance plans proposed for 2017, which I may write about elsewhere, and a healthy 64 year old with a good income is looking at a minimum of  about $27,000 for the year in premiums and the deductible. How many older people are working a job just for the insurance benefits? Allowing those older people access to Medicare, which might allow them to retire before age 65, helps younger workers by creating new job openings. Younger people get to move up the ladder to a better job. Win-Win. Why aren't we doing this?",

The man's entire body was shutting down and he had only days to live.  My friend mentioned alcohol to the man and asked if he wanted to talk at all about its effects on his life.  The man looked at my friend and said that alcohol wasn't his problem and he wasn't an alcoholic, but his brother sure was.\n\nSome people will deny truth up to their very last breath.

Mohammed their prophet was a pedophile and a mass murder. Islam does not fit my definition of religion. Does your religion ordered you to kill or enslave people not of your religion?

If anything, the reverse seems more likely with events like Marbury v. Madison.  A case which illustrated that the US was a \"nation of laws.\"\n\nThe Senate has a legal duty to advice certain Presidential actions.  The reason why we have only one office in the Executive is for swift action.  Other executive actions are open to disagreement, such as treaties and use of the military, and not even holding a hearing for any of them is a gross dereliction of duty.\n\nI'd say it is fair to conclude the Republican led Senate undermined the process.

London has a population of approximately 8.5 million and 10K of that is one tenth of one percent of the population of the city as a whole. Unless all Syrian expats go to London for months on end, it won't make a huge dent in the demographics.\n\nAccording to an article appearing in a 2015 issue of the Guardian, London's population increased by 900K or 12% since 2001. That means London was naturally growing by about .85% per year. So at the end of the day 10K is about 1/8th of the annual average population growth in London. Granted some of these people may be in need of immediate assistance, but long term is more important as the short term won't break the bank.\n\nYou are correct regarding the notion of culture; however, bigotry isn't limited to racism.",

The Quran is read by too many Muslims to sanction the killing of infidels, simply because they are infidels.  There you have the making of another American disaster.  Now, if the chances of terrorists' entering the country were small, or if the size of the harm they pose were small, there would be a good argument that NO special vetting is needed.  But no other population has, in recent times, had so many practitioners of both frequent and huge-scale violence.  So long as there are so many Muslims committing so many acts of terror in the name of Islam, we are rational in at least taking special care to see that those who come aren't a real risk.",

I was already weaning myself from pro sports as my disgust grew as the money being paid to players and collected by owners reached obscene levels. I don't see a society that pays more to athletes than doctors, college professors, scientists and engineers as healthy. It costs around $100 for a year long family membership to most museums - or less than the price of one decent ticket to a pro game (other than baseball). So thanks guys - I'm thinking of starting a flag football league for Sunday afternoons. We'll sing the national anthem before games - while standing. I'll post where we play so y'all can come watch.

A quick stroll through the UN Development Index shows Cuba to be ahead of its neighbours in virtually every development index: education, lifespan, infant mortality, violent crime rate, etc. All this in the face of a US blockade.  Now, I absolutely accept that most people in Cuba want more freedom - we heard that time and again during our travels. Further, average incomes are very low.  However, the hard numbers (i.e not soft, hippy, rose-coloured glasses sentiment) show that, on many of the indicators that matter, Cuba comes out looking pretty good.  No, not compared to the US or Canada, but compared to neighbours such as Mexico, Costa Rica, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, etc.",

In all those years, I have never heard anyone describe pidgin as broken or for the stupid.  I've known people who were fascinated and intrigued by it but never considered it broken or the people who spoke it stupid.

Free speech is the first right listed in the bill of rights. Rights are inherent to every living thing, and therefore by definition cannot be legislated. Its why the founders were careful to use the word enumerate in the bill of rights, as to use any other language might make the reader presume that rights are given to us by our constitution and our founders, and they are not. To attempt to legislate a right would mean that to be not a right but a privilege, and with that restrictions to follow, which this article was quick to reference.  \"Under the “New Voices Act” legislation, student editors would be responsible for content\".
